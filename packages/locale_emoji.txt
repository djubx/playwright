# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using locale_emoji

## Installation
To get started with the `locale_emoji` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  locale_emoji: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 9.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
```

## Using the Package
To use the `locale_emoji` package, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:locale_emoji/locale_emoji.dart';
```

You can then access emojis based on the user's locale. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to display an emoji:

```dart
String emoji = LocaleEmoji.get('smile'); // Fetches the smile emoji
```

You can also fetch emojis based on the locale:

```dart
String localeEmoji = LocaleEmoji.getByLocale('en_US', 'smile'); // Fetches the smile emoji for the US locale
```

This allows you to easily integrate emojis into your Flutter applications based on the user's locale.

# Complete Example of locale_emoji in a Flutter App

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:locale_emoji/locale_emoji.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Locale Emoji Example',
      home: EmojiHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class EmojiHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Locale Emoji Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Fetching a smile emoji
            Text(
              LocaleEmoji.get('smile'), // Displaying the smile emoji
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 50), // Setting the font size
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between emojis
            // Fetching a locale-specific smile emoji
            Text(
              LocaleEmoji.getByLocale('en_US', 'smile'), // Displaying the smile emoji for US locale
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 50), // Setting the font size
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget sets up a MaterialApp with a title and a home page.
// The EmojiHomePage widget builds the UI, which consists of a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the emoji texts vertically.
// The first Text widget displays a general smile emoji, while the second Text widget fetches and displays a locale-specific smile emoji for the US.
// Both emojis are styled with a larger font size for better visibility.
```

### Summary of Application Flow
The application begins execution in the `main` function, which initializes the `RealFlutter` widget. This widget sets up a `MaterialApp` with a title and a home page. The `EmojiHomePage` widget constructs the user interface, featuring a `Scaffold` that includes an `AppBar` and a `Center` widget. Within the `Center` widget, a `Column` arranges two `Text` widgets vertically. The first `Text` widget displays a general smile emoji, while the second fetches and displays a locale-specific smile emoji for the US. Both emojis are styled with a larger font size to enhance visibility, creating an engaging and user-friendly interface.
