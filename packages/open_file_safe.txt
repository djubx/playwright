# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Open File Safe

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `open_file_safe` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  open_file_safe: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/open_file_safe).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, you need to ensure that your app has the necessary permissions to read and write files. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist` to request permission for file access:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to open files.</string>
<key>NSDocumentsFolderUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your documents to open files.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to open a file securely.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:open_file_safe/open_file_safe.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Open File Safe Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Specify the file path and type
              String filePath = '/path/to/your/file.pdf';
              String fileType = 'application/pdf';

              // Open the file securely
              final result = await OpenFile.open(filePath, type: fileType);
              // Handle the result
              if (result.type == ResultType.done) {
                print('File opened successfully');
              } else {
                print('Error opening file: ${result.message}');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Open PDF File'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with a button that opens a PDF file when pressed. The `OpenFile.open` method is used to open the file securely, and the result is handled accordingly.

# Complete Example of Open File Safe

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:open_file_safe/open_file_safe.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Open File Safe Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Specify the file path and type
              String filePath = '/path/to/your/file.pdf'; // Path to the file
              String fileType = 'application/pdf'; // MIME type of the file

              // Open the file securely
              final result = await OpenFile.open(filePath, type: fileType);
              // Handle the result
              if (result.type == ResultType.done) {
                print('File opened successfully'); // Success message
              } else {
                print('Error opening file: ${result.message}'); // Error message
              }
            },
            child: Text('Open PDF File'), // Button text
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The MaterialApp widget is created, providing the app structure.
// 3. A Scaffold widget is used to create the basic visual layout, including an AppBar and body.
// 4. In the body, a Center widget is used to center the content.
// 5. An ElevatedButton is created, which triggers the file opening process when pressed.
// 6. Inside the onPressed callback, the file path and type are specified.
// 7. The OpenFile.open method is called to open the specified file securely.
// 8. The result of the file opening operation is checked, and appropriate messages are printed to the console based on success or failure.
```
