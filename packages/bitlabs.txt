The **Bitlabs** Flutter package is a powerful tool designed for developers looking to integrate blockchain functionalities into their Flutter applications. This package simplifies the process of interacting with various blockchain networks, making it easier to build decentralized applications (dApps) and manage cryptocurrency transactions.

## When to Use Bitlabs
- **Blockchain Integration**: If your application requires interaction with blockchain networks for transactions, smart contracts, or data storage.
- **Cryptocurrency Wallets**: When building a wallet application that needs to manage multiple cryptocurrencies.
- **Decentralized Applications**: For developers creating dApps that require secure and efficient blockchain communication.

## Key Features
- **Multi-Blockchain Support**: Interact with various blockchain networks seamlessly.
- **Transaction Management**: Simplified methods for sending and receiving cryptocurrencies.
- **Smart Contract Interaction**: Easy integration with smart contracts for executing complex transactions.
- **User-Friendly API**: A well-structured API that simplifies blockchain interactions for developers.

With these features, Bitlabs stands out as a robust solution for Flutter developers venturing into the blockchain space.

# Bitlabs Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the Bitlabs package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  bitlabs: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:
   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

## Basic Usage
To use the Bitlabs package, you will typically start by initializing the package and setting up your blockchain connection. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to do this:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bitlabs/bitlabs.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Bitlabs Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Bitlabs Integration'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Welcome to Bitlabs!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application with a title and a welcome message. You can expand upon this by adding blockchain functionalities as needed.

# Complete Example of Bitlabs Integration

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bitlabs/bitlabs.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Initialize the Bitlabs instance
  final Bitlabs bitlabs = Bitlabs();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Connect to the blockchain network
    bitlabs.connect('https://your-blockchain-node-url'); // Replace with your blockchain node URL
  }

  // Function to send cryptocurrency
  void sendCrypto() async {
    try {
      // Sending cryptocurrency
      var response = await bitlabs.sendTransaction(
        toAddress: 'recipient-address', // Replace with recipient address
        amount: 0.01, // Amount to send
      );
      // Handle the response
      print('Transaction successful: $response');
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors
      print('Error sending transaction: $e');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Bitlabs Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Bitlabs Integration'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: sendCrypto, // Call sendCrypto when button is pressed
            child: Text('Send Cryptocurrency'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the initState method, we connect to the blockchain network using the Bitlabs instance.
// 3. The UI consists of a button that, when pressed, triggers the sendCrypto function.
// 4. The sendCrypto function attempts to send a specified amount of cryptocurrency to a recipient address.
// 5. If the transaction is successful, it prints the response; otherwise, it catches and prints any errors.
```
