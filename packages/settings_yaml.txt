# Settings Yaml Package for Flutter
=====================================

The settings_yaml package is a convenient way to manage application settings in a Flutter project. It allows you to store and retrieve settings in a YAML file, making it easy to configure and customize your app.

### When to Use This Package

This package is useful when you need to store settings that are not sensitive, such as API keys, theme preferences, or other configuration options. It's also a good choice when you want to allow users to customize certain aspects of your app.

### Features

*   Store and retrieve settings in a YAML file
*   Support for nested settings
*   Easy to use API

# Tutorial: Using the Settings Yaml Package
==========================================

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

Add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  settings_yaml: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Create a YAML File

Create a new file called `settings.yaml` in the root of your project:

```yml
theme: light
api_key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Step 3: Load the Settings

Use the `SettingsYaml` class to load the settings from the YAML file:

```dart
import 'package:settings_yaml/settings_yaml.dart';

void main() async {
  final settings = SettingsYaml.load('settings.yaml');
  print(settings['theme']); // prints 'light'
  print(settings['api_key']); // prints 'YOUR_API_KEY'
}
```

### Platform-Specific Details

*   Android: Make sure to add the `settings.yaml` file to the `android/app/src/main/assets` directory.
*   iOS: Make sure to add the `settings.yaml` file to the `ios/Runner` directory.

### Required Configurations or Optimizations

*   Make sure to handle errors when loading the settings, in case the YAML file is not found or is malformed.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:settings_yaml/settings_yaml.dart';

void main() async {
  // Load the settings from the YAML file
  final settings = await SettingsYaml.load('settings.yaml');

  // Create a new MaterialApp with the theme from the settings
  runApp(MyApp(settings['theme']));
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  final String theme;

  MyApp(this.theme);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Settings Yaml Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        brightness: theme == 'light' ? Brightness.light : Brightness.dark,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Settings Yaml Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Hello, World!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The main function loads the settings from the YAML file using SettingsYaml.load.
// 2. The main function creates a new MaterialApp with the theme from the settings.
// 3. The MaterialApp creates a new MyHomePage widget.
// 4. The MyHomePage widget creates a new Scaffold with an AppBar and a Text widget.
// 5. The Text widget displays the text 'Hello, World!'.
// 
// In summary, the code flows from the main function to the MyHomePage widget, 
// and finally to the Text widget, which displays the text 'Hello, World!'.
```
