# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Currency TextField Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `currency_textfield` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  currency_textfield: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Currency TextField

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the `CurrencyTextField` in your app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:currency_textfield/currency_textfield.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Currency TextField Example'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: CurrencyTextField(
            controller: TextEditingController(),
            currencySymbol: '\$',
            decimalDigits: 2,
            onChanged: (value) {
              // Handle the value change
              print('Current value: $value');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with a `CurrencyTextField` that formats input as US dollars. The `onChanged` callback allows you to handle the input value dynamically.

# Complete Example of Currency TextField

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:currency_textfield/currency_textfield.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Currency TextField Example'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Column(
            children: [
              // Currency TextField for input
              CurrencyTextField(
                controller: TextEditingController(),
                currencySymbol: '\$',
                decimalDigits: 2,
                onChanged: (value) {
                  // Handle the value change
                  print('Current value: $value');
                },
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Button to submit the value
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Logic to handle submission
                  // For example, you could save the value or send it to an API
                  print('Value submitted');
                },
                child: Text('Submit'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a body with a CurrencyTextField and a button.
// 4. The CurrencyTextField allows users to input currency values, automatically formatting them as they type.
// 5. The onChanged callback prints the current value to the console whenever the input changes.
// 6. The Submit button, when pressed, prints a message indicating that the value has been submitted.
// 7. This simple flow demonstrates how to use the currency_textfield package effectively in a Flutter application.
