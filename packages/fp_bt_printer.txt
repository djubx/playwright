# Tutorial

## Setup Process

To get started with the `fp_bt_printer` package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the `fp_bt_printer` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  fp_bt_printer: ^latest_version
```

Replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/fp_bt_printer).

### Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android

1. **Permissions**: Add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
```

2. **Bluetooth Settings**: Ensure that Bluetooth is enabled on the device.

#### iOS

1. **Permissions**: Add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires Bluetooth access to connect to printers.</string>
<key>NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires Bluetooth access to connect to printers.</string>
```

2. **Bluetooth Settings**: Ensure that Bluetooth is enabled on the device.

### Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:fp_bt_printer/fp_bt_printer.dart';
```

## Using the Package

### Step 1: Initialize the Printer

Create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class to manage Bluetooth printing:

```dart
RealFlutter printer = RealFlutter();
```

### Step 2: Connect to a Printer

Use the following method to connect to a Bluetooth printer:

```dart
await printer.connect(printerAddress);
```

### Step 3: Send Print Commands

You can send various print commands, such as printing text or images:

```dart
await printer.printText("Hello, World!");
```

### Step 4: Disconnect from the Printer

After printing, disconnect from the printer:

```dart
await printer.disconnect();
```

This setup will allow you to integrate Bluetooth printing into your Flutter application seamlessly.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fp_bt_printer/fp_bt_printer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Bluetooth Printer Example',
      home: PrinterHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class PrinterHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PrinterHomePageState createState() => _PrinterHomePageState();
}

class _PrinterHomePageState extends State<PrinterHomePage> {
  RealFlutter printer = RealFlutter(); // Create an instance of the printer
  String printerAddress = "00:11:22:33:44:55"; // Replace with your printer's address

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the printer connection
    _connectToPrinter();
  }

  Future<void> _connectToPrinter() async {
    try {
      await printer.connect(printerAddress); // Connect to the printer
      print("Connected to printer");
    } catch (e) {
      print("Error connecting to printer: $e");
    }
  }

  Future<void> _printReceipt() async {
    try {
      await printer.printText("Receipt"); // Print the receipt title
      await printer.printText("Item 1: \$10.00"); // Print item details
      await printer.printText("Item 2: \$15.00");
      await printer.printText("Total: \$25.00");
      print("Receipt printed successfully");
    } catch (e) {
      print("Error printing receipt: $e");
    }
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    printer.disconnect(); // Disconnect from the printer when done
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Bluetooth Printer Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _printReceipt, // Trigger the print receipt function
          child: Text('Print Receipt'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and initializes the MyApp widget.
// 2. The PrinterHomePage widget is created, which initializes the RealFlutter printer instance.
// 3. In the initState method, the app attempts to connect to the Bluetooth printer using the specified address.
// 4. When the user presses the "Print Receipt" button, the _printReceipt method is called.
// 5. The _printReceipt method sends print commands to the printer to print the receipt details.
// 6. Finally, when the app is disposed, it disconnects from the printer to free up resources.
```
