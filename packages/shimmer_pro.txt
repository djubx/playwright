# Shimmer Pro Flutter Package: An Overview

The `shimmer_pro` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to enhance the user interface of your Flutter applications by adding shimmer effects. Shimmer effects are often used as loading indicators, providing a visually appealing way to indicate that content is being loaded or processed. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to keep users engaged while waiting for data to load, such as in news apps, social media feeds, or e-commerce platforms.

## Key Features

- **Customizable Shimmer Effects**: Adjust the color, direction, and speed of the shimmer to fit your app's design.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that allows you to wrap any widget with a shimmer effect.
- **Performance Optimized**: Designed to be lightweight and efficient, ensuring smooth animations even on lower-end devices.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

## When to Use

- **Loading States**: Use shimmer effects to indicate loading states for images, text, or any other content.
- **Skeleton Screens**: Create skeleton screens that mimic the layout of your content, providing a placeholder while the actual data is being fetched.
- **Interactive UI Elements**: Enhance buttons or other interactive elements with shimmer effects to draw user attention.

# Setting Up and Using Shimmer Pro in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up the `shimmer_pro` package in a Flutter project and demonstrate how to use it effectively.

## Installation

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add `shimmer_pro` as a dependency.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     shimmer_pro: ^1.0.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run `flutter pub get` to install the new package.

## Basic Usage

To use the `shimmer_pro` package, you need to wrap the widget you want to shimmer with the `RealFlutter` class provided by the package.

```dart
import 'package:shimmer_pro/shimmer_pro.dart';

RealFlutter(
  child: Container(
    width: 200.0,
    height: 100.0,
    color: Colors.grey[300],
  ),
)
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

- Ensure your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to support the necessary animations.

### iOS

- No additional setup is required for iOS, but ensure your deployment target is set to iOS 9.0 or higher in your `ios/Podfile`.

## Configuration and Optimization

- **Customizing Shimmer**: You can customize the shimmer effect by setting properties like `baseColor`, `highlightColor`, `direction`, and `period`.

  ```dart
  RealFlutter(
    baseColor: Colors.grey[300],
    highlightColor: Colors.grey[100],
    direction: ShimmerDirection.ltr,
    period: Duration(seconds: 2),
    child: Container(
      width: 200.0,
      height: 100.0,
      color: Colors.grey[300],
    ),
  )
  ```

- **Performance Tips**: For better performance, avoid using shimmer effects on very large widgets or complex layouts.

# Complete Example: Flutter Main File with Shimmer Pro

Below is a complete example of a Flutter application using the `shimmer_pro` package to demonstrate its key features.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:shimmer_pro/shimmer_pro.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// Main application widget
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Shimmer Pro Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: ShimmerDemoPage(),
    );
  }
}

// Home page widget demonstrating shimmer effects
class ShimmerDemoPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Shimmer Pro Example'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Shimmer effect on a text widget
            RealFlutter(
              baseColor: Colors.grey[300],
              highlightColor: Colors.grey[100],
              child: Container(
                width: double.infinity,
                height: 20.0,
                color: Colors.grey[300],
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 16.0),
            // Shimmer effect on a rectangular box
            RealFlutter(
              baseColor: Colors.grey[300],
              highlightColor: Colors.grey[100],
              child: Container(
                width: 200.0,
                height: 100.0,
                color: Colors.grey[300],
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 16.0),
            // Shimmer effect on a circular avatar
            RealFlutter(
              baseColor: Colors.grey[300],
              highlightColor: Colors.grey[100],
              child: CircleAvatar(
                radius: 50.0,
                backgroundColor: Colors.grey[300],
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// Application Flow Explanation
// 1. The `main` function initializes the app by calling `runApp` with `MyApp`.
// 2. `MyApp` is a stateless widget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home page is set to `ShimmerDemoPage`, which demonstrates the shimmer effects.
// 4. `ShimmerDemoPage` is a stateless widget that builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 5. The body contains a Column with three examples of shimmer effects:
//    - A shimmer effect on a text-like container.
//    - A shimmer effect on a rectangular box.
//    - A shimmer effect on a circular avatar.
// 6. Each example uses the `RealFlutter` widget to apply the shimmer effect, with customizable colors and sizes.
