# Tutorial: Setting Up the Candlesticks Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **candlesticks** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **candlesticks** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  candlesticks: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configurations

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Candlesticks Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a candlestick chart.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:candlesticks/candlesticks.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Candlestick Chart Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Candlestick Chart'),
        ),
        body: CandlestickChartExample(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class CandlestickChartExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample data for the candlestick chart
    final List<Candle> candles = [
      Candle(open: 100, close: 110, high: 115, low: 95, time: DateTime.now().subtract(Duration(days: 4))),
      Candle(open: 110, close: 105, high: 112, low: 100, time: DateTime.now().subtract(Duration(days: 3))),
      Candle(open: 105, close: 120, high: 125, low: 100, time: DateTime.now().subtract(Duration(days: 2))),
      Candle(open: 120, close: 115, high: 130, low: 110, time: DateTime.now().subtract(Duration(days: 1))),
      Candle(open: 115, close: 125, high: 135, low: 110, time: DateTime.now()),
    ];

    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
      child: CandlestickChart(
        candles: candles,
        // Customizing the appearance of the chart
        candleColor: Colors.green,
        wickColor: Colors.black,
        gridColor: Colors.grey,
        // Adding interactivity
        onCandleTap: (candle) {
          // Handle candle tap event
          ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
            SnackBar(content: Text('Tapped on candle: ${candle.close}')),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and the CandlestickChartExample widget.
// 3. The CandlestickChartExample widget creates a list of Candle objects representing the financial data.
// 4. The CandlestickChart widget is used to display the candlestick chart, with customization options for colors and interactivity.
// 5. When a user taps on a candle, a SnackBar displays the closing price of the tapped candle.
```
