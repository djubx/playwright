# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Lindi Sticker Widget

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **lindi_sticker_widget** package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **lindi_sticker_widget** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  lindi_sticker_widget: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you plan to use stickers that require internet access or other capabilities.

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the **lindi_sticker_widget** in your app.

<!-- END_TUTORIAL -->

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:lindi_sticker_widget/lindi_sticker_widget.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Lindi Sticker Widget Demo',
      home: StickerHome(),
    );
  }
}

class StickerHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _StickerHomeState createState() => _StickerHomeState();
}

class _StickerHomeState extends State<StickerHome> {
  // List to hold sticker packs
  final List<StickerPack> stickerPacks = [
    StickerPack(
      id: '1',
      name: 'Funny Stickers',
      stickers: [
        'assets/stickers/funny1.png',
        'assets/stickers/funny2.png',
        'assets/stickers/funny3.png',
      ],
    ),
    StickerPack(
      id: '2',
      name: 'Cute Animals',
      stickers: [
        'assets/stickers/cute1.png',
        'assets/stickers/cute2.png',
        'assets/stickers/cute3.png',
      ],
    ),
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Sticker Widget Example'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Display sticker packs
          Expanded(
            child: ListView.builder(
              itemCount: stickerPacks.length,
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text(stickerPacks[index].name),
                  onTap: () {
                    // Open sticker pack when tapped
                    showStickerPack(stickerPacks[index]);
                  },
                );
              },
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }

  void showStickerPack(StickerPack pack) {
    // Show the sticker pack using the lindi_sticker_widget
    showDialog(
      context: context,
      builder: (context) {
        return AlertDialog(
          title: Text(pack.name),
          content: SizedBox(
            height: 200,
            child: GridView.builder(
              gridDelegate: SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount(crossAxisCount: 3),
              itemCount: pack.stickers.length,
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                return GestureDetector(
                  onTap: () {
                    // Handle sticker tap
                    print('Sticker tapped: ${pack.stickers[index]}');
                    Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close dialog
                  },
                  child: Image.asset(pack.stickers[index]),
                );
              },
            ),
          ),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and home set to StickerHome.
// 3. StickerHome displays a list of sticker packs using a ListView.
// 4. When a sticker pack is tapped, the showStickerPack method is called.
// 5. This method opens a dialog displaying the stickers in a grid format.
// 6. Tapping a sticker prints its path to the console and closes the dialog.
```
<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application that displays a list of sticker packs. When a user taps on a sticker pack, a dialog opens showing the stickers in that pack. Tapping a sticker prints its path to the console, demonstrating how you can handle user interactions.

### Summary of Application Flow
- The application starts with the `main` function, which initializes the `RealFlutter` widget.
- The `RealFlutter` widget sets up the main structure of the app, including the title and home screen.
- The `StickerHome` widget manages the display of sticker packs and user interactions.
- When a sticker pack is selected, a dialog is shown with the stickers, allowing users to select and interact with them.

This structure provides a clear and functional way to integrate the **lindi_sticker_widget** into your Flutter applications, enhancing user engagement through visual communication.
