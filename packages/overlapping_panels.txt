# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Overlapping Panels Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **overlapping_panels** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  overlapping_panels: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:overlapping_panels/overlapping_panels.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the `OverlappingPanels` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
OverlappingPanels(
  panels: [
    Panel(
      color: Colors.blue,
      child: Text('Panel 1'),
    ),
    Panel(
      color: Colors.red,
      child: Text('Panel 2'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

This will create two overlapping panels with different colors and text.

## Step 5: Customization

You can customize the panels by adjusting properties such as `alignment`, `padding`, and `borderRadius` to achieve the desired look and feel.

# Complete Example of Overlapping Panels

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:overlapping_panels/overlapping_panels.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Overlapping Panels Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Overlapping Panels Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: OverlappingPanels(
            panels: [
              // First panel with blue background
              Panel(
                color: Colors.blue,
                child: Container(
                  width: 200,
                  height: 200,
                  alignment: Alignment.center,
                  child: Text(
                    'Panel 1',
                    style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24),
                  ),
                ),
              ),
              // Second panel with red background
              Panel(
                color: Colors.red,
                child: Container(
                  width: 150,
                  height: 150,
                  alignment: Alignment.center,
                  child: Text(
                    'Panel 2',
                    style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24),
                  ),
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Overlapping Panels Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers the OverlappingPanels widget.
// 5. The OverlappingPanels widget contains two panels:
//    - The first panel is blue, sized 200x200, and displays 'Panel 1'.
//    - The second panel is red, sized 150x150, and displays 'Panel 2'.
// 6. The panels overlap, creating a visually appealing layout.
```
