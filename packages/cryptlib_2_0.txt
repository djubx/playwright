Here's a detailed technical blog on the "cryptlib_2_0" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Description

The `cryptlib_2_0` Flutter package is a powerful library designed for cryptographic operations in Flutter applications. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for encryption, decryption, hashing, and encoding, making it an essential choice for developers who need to secure sensitive data in their apps.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `cryptlib_2_0` package in scenarios such as:

- **Secure Data Storage**: When you need to store sensitive information like user credentials or personal data securely.
- **Data Transmission**: If your application communicates with a server and you need to ensure that the data sent over the network is encrypted.
- **Hashing Passwords**: For applications that require user authentication, hashing passwords before storing them is crucial for security.

## Features

- **Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption**: Supports various encryption algorithms, allowing you to choose the best fit for your needs.
- **Hashing Functions**: Provides multiple hashing algorithms, including SHA-256 and MD5, for data integrity checks.
- **Encoding and Decoding**: Facilitates Base64 encoding and decoding, which is useful for data transmission.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

With these features, `cryptlib_2_0` is a versatile package that can enhance the security of your Flutter applications.

# Tutorial

## Setup Process

To get started with the `cryptlib_2_0` package, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `cryptlib_2_0` package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     cryptlib_2_0: ^2.0.0
   ```

2. **Install the Package**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

     ```groovy
     android {
         ...
         defaultConfig {
             ...
             minSdkVersion 21
         }
     }
     ```

   - **iOS**: Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following permissions if you are using network operations:

     ```xml
     <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
     <dict>
         <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
         <true/>
     </dict>
     ```

## Using the Package

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the `cryptlib_2_0` package in your Flutter application:

1. **Import the Package**:

   ```dart
   import 'package:cryptlib_2_0/cryptlib_2_0.dart';
   ```

2. **Basic Usage**:

   - **Encryption**:

     ```dart
     String plainText = "Hello, Flutter!";
     String key = "my_secret_key";
     String encryptedText = CryptLib.encrypt(plainText, key);
     ```

   - **Decryption**:

     ```dart
     String decryptedText = CryptLib.decrypt(encryptedText, key);
     ```

   - **Hashing**:

     ```dart
     String password = "my_password";
     String hashedPassword = CryptLib.hash(password);
     ```

3. **Error Handling**: Always implement error handling to manage exceptions that may arise during encryption or decryption processes.

By following these steps, you can effectively integrate the `cryptlib_2_0` package into your Flutter application and utilize its cryptographic capabilities.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cryptlib_2_0/cryptlib_2_0.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'CryptLib Example',
      home: CryptLibExample(),
    );
  }
}

class CryptLibExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CryptLibExampleState createState() => _CryptLibExampleState();
}

class _CryptLibExampleState extends State<CryptLibExample> {
  String _plainText = "Hello, Flutter!";
  String _key = "my_secret_key";
  String _encryptedText = "";
  String _decryptedText = "";
  String _hashedPassword = "";

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _encryptData();
    _decryptData();
    _hashPassword();
  }

  void _encryptData() {
    // Encrypt the plain text using the provided key
    _encryptedText = CryptLib.encrypt(_plainText, _key);
  }

  void _decryptData() {
    // Decrypt the previously encrypted text using the same key
    _decryptedText = CryptLib.decrypt(_encryptedText, _key);
  }

  void _hashPassword() {
    // Hash the password for secure storage
    _hashedPassword = CryptLib.hash("my_password");
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('CryptLib Example'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
          children: [
            Text('Plain Text: $_plainText'),
            SizedBox(height: 10),
            Text('Encrypted Text: $_encryptedText'),
            SizedBox(height: 10),
            Text('Decrypted Text: $_decryptedText'),
            SizedBox(height: 10),
            Text('Hashed Password: $_hashedPassword'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and home set to CryptLibExample.
// 3. CryptLibExample is a stateful widget that initializes the encryption, decryption, and hashing processes in its initState method.
// 4. The _encryptData method encrypts the plain text using the specified key and stores the result in _encryptedText.
// 5. The _decryptData method decrypts the encrypted text back to plain text using the same key and stores it in _decryptedText.
// 6. The _hashPassword method hashes a sample password and stores it in _hashedPassword.
// 7. The build method displays the plain text, encrypted text, decrypted text, and hashed password in the UI.
