<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Auto Size Widget Flutter Package

The `auto_size_widget` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that allows widgets to automatically resize based on the available space. This is particularly useful in responsive design, where the layout needs to adapt to different screen sizes and orientations. 

## When to Use

You should consider using the `auto_size_widget` package in scenarios such as:
- **Responsive UIs**: When building applications that need to look good on various screen sizes, from small phones to large tablets.
- **Dynamic Content**: When the content size is not fixed and can change based on user input or data fetched from a server.
- **Text Overflow Management**: To prevent text from overflowing its container, ensuring a clean and user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Automatic Resizing**: Automatically adjusts the size of the widget based on the constraints provided by its parent.
- **Customizable**: Offers various properties to customize the resizing behavior, such as minimum and maximum sizes.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate into existing Flutter applications with minimal setup.

By leveraging the `auto_size_widget`, developers can create more flexible and adaptive user interfaces that enhance the overall user experience.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Auto Size Widget

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `auto_size_widget`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  auto_size_widget: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Auto Size Widget

You can now use the `AutoSizeWidget` in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:auto_size_widget/auto_size_widget.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Auto Size Widget Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: AutoSizeWidget(
            minWidth: 100,
            maxWidth: 300,
            minHeight: 50,
            maxHeight: 150,
            child: Container(
              color: Colors.blue,
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'This text will resize!',
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 30),
                  textAlign: TextAlign.center,
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `AutoSizeWidget` will resize the container based on the available space, ensuring that the text remains visible and well-formatted.

# Complete Example of Auto Size Widget

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:auto_size_widget/auto_size_widget.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Auto Size Widget Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          // Centering the AutoSizeWidget in the middle of the screen
          child: AutoSizeWidget(
            minWidth: 100, // Minimum width of the widget
            maxWidth: 300, // Maximum width of the widget
            minHeight: 50, // Minimum height of the widget
            maxHeight: 150, // Maximum height of the widget
            child: Container(
              color: Colors.blue, // Background color of the container
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'This text will resize!', // Text that will be resized
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 30), // Initial font size
                  textAlign: TextAlign.center, // Centering the text
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the RealFlutter app
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the UI.
// 3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// 4. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. The Center widget holds the AutoSizeWidget, which automatically resizes based on the available space.
// 6. The AutoSizeWidget has defined minimum and maximum dimensions to control its size.
// 7. Inside the AutoSizeWidget, a Container is created with a blue background.
// 8. The Container contains a Center widget that centers the text.
// 9. The text is displayed with an initial font size of 30, and it will resize according to the constraints of the AutoSizeWidget.
```
