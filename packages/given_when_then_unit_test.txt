# Given-When-Then Unit Test Flutter Package
=============================================

The `given_when_then_unit_test` package is a Flutter package that provides a simple and easy-to-use API for writing unit tests in a Given-When-Then style. This style of testing is a popular approach to writing tests that are easy to read and understand.

## When to Use This Package
---------------------------

This package is useful when you want to write unit tests for your Flutter application in a structured and easy-to-read way. It is particularly useful when you have complex business logic that you want to test thoroughly.

## Features
------------

*   Easy-to-use API for writing unit tests in a Given-When-Then style
*   Supports testing of asynchronous code
*   Supports testing of error cases

# Tutorial
==========

## Setup
--------

To use this package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter
  given_when_then_unit_test: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to get the package.

## Writing Tests
----------------

To write a test, you need to create a test file and import the `given_when_then_unit_test` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:given_when_then_unit_test/given_when_then_unit_test.dart';
```

Then, you can write a test using the `given`, `when`, and `then` functions:

```dart
void main() {
  test('RealFlutter test', () {
    given('a RealFlutter instance', () {
      final realFlutter = RealFlutter();
    });

    when('the instance is initialized', () {
      realFlutter.init();
    });

    then('the instance is initialized', () {
      expect(realFlutter.isInitialized, true);
    });
  });
}
```

## Platform-Specific Details
---------------------------

This package works on both Android and iOS platforms.

### Android

No platform-specific configuration is needed for Android.

### iOS

No platform-specific configuration is needed for iOS.

## Required Configurations or Optimizations

```dart
// Import the necessary packages
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:given_when_then_unit_test/given_when_then_unit_test.dart';

// Define the RealFlutter class
class RealFlutter {
  bool _isInitialized = false;

  void init() {
    _isInitialized = true;
  }

  bool get isInitialized => _isInitialized;
}

void main() {
  // Create a test group
  group('RealFlutter test group', () {
    // Create a test
    test('RealFlutter test', () {
      // Given a RealFlutter instance
      given('a RealFlutter instance', () {
        final realFlutter = RealFlutter();
      });

      // When the instance is initialized
      when('the instance is initialized', () {
        realFlutter.init();
      });

      // Then the instance is initialized
      then('the instance is initialized', () {
        expect(realFlutter.isInitialized, true);
      });
    });
  });

  // The application flow is as follows:
  // 1. The test group is created.
  // 2. The test is created.
  // 3. The given condition is set up (a RealFlutter instance is created).
  // 4. The when condition is executed (the instance is initialized).
  // 5. The then condition is verified (the instance is initialized).
  // The test passes if the then condition is true.

  // Final summary: This code tests the initialization of a RealFlutter instance.
