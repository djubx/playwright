# Setting Up the Kalender Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To use the kalender package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  kalender: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install the Package
Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` file to allow for calendar access if your app requires it. Add the following keys:

```xml
<key>NSCalendarsUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your calendar.</string>
```

## Step 4: Import the Package
In your Dart file, import the kalender package:

```dart
import 'package:kalender/kalender.dart';
```

## Step 5: Basic Usage
You can now use the kalender widget in your application. Here’s a simple example of how to implement it in your widget tree:

```dart
Kalender(
  onDateSelected: (date) {
    print("Selected date: $date");
  },
  events: {
    DateTime(2024, 9, 15): ['Event 1', 'Event 2'],
    DateTime(2024, 9, 20): ['Event 3'],
  },
)
```

This basic setup allows you to display a calendar and handle date selection events. You can customize the appearance and behavior further based on your application’s requirements.

# Complete Example of Using the Kalender Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:kalender/kalender.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Kalender Example',
      home: CalendarHome(),
    );
  }
}

class CalendarHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CalendarHomeState createState() => _CalendarHomeState();
}

class _CalendarHomeState extends State<CalendarHome> {
  DateTime? selectedDate; // Variable to hold the selected date
  final Map<DateTime, List<String>> events = {
    DateTime(2024, 9, 15): ['Meeting with team', 'Doctor appointment'],
    DateTime(2024, 9, 20): ['Project deadline'],
  };

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Kalender Example'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Display the calendar widget
          Kalender(
            onDateSelected: (date) {
              setState(() {
                selectedDate = date; // Update the selected date
              });
            },
            events: events, // Pass the events to the calendar
          ),
          // Display the selected date and events
          if (selectedDate != null) ...[
            Text(
              'Selected Date: ${selectedDate!.toLocal()}'.split(' ')[0],
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            ...events[selectedDate!]!.map((event) => Text(event)).toList(),
          ],
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home widget.
// 3. CalendarHome is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the selected date and events.
// 4. The build method of CalendarHome constructs the UI, including the Kalender widget and a display for the selected date and events.
// 5. When a date is selected in the Kalender widget, the onDateSelected callback updates the selectedDate state.
// 6. The UI updates to show the selected date and any events associated with that date.
```
