# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using simple_widget_snapshot

## Installation

```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/simple_widget_snapshot).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `simple_widget_snapshot` package, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:
   ```dart
   import 'package:simple_widget_snapshot/simple_widget_snapshot.dart';
   ```

2. Wrap the widget you want to capture with the `Snapshot` widget provided by the package.

3. Use the `snapshot` method to capture the widget and display it as an image.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the package:

```dart
Snapshot(
  child: YourWidget(), // Replace with your actual widget
  onSnapshot: (image) {
    // Handle the captured image
  },
);
```

This will allow you to capture the widget and use the image as needed.

# Complete Example of simple_widget_snapshot

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simple_widget_snapshot/simple_widget_snapshot.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Simple Widget Snapshot Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Widget Snapshot Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Snapshot(
            // Wrapping the widget we want to capture
            child: Column(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              children: <Widget>[
                Text(
                  'Hello, Flutter!',
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
                ),
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () {
                    // Trigger snapshot capture
                  },
                  child: Text('Capture Snapshot'),
                ),
              ],
            ),
            onSnapshot: (image) {
              // This callback is called with the captured image
              // You can display it or save it as needed
              showDialog(
                context: context,
                builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                  title: Text('Captured Snapshot'),
                  content: Image.memory(image), // Displaying the captured image
                  actions: [
                    TextButton(
                      onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                      child: Text('Close'),
                    ),
                  ],
                ),
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, a Center widget is used to center the content.
// 4. The Snapshot widget wraps a Column containing a Text widget and an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the snapshot of the Column is captured.
// 6. The captured image is passed to the onSnapshot callback, where it is displayed in an AlertDialog.
// 7. The user can close the dialog to return to the main screen.
