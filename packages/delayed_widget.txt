=====================================

The `delayed_widget` package is a useful tool for Flutter developers who want to introduce a delay in the rendering of a widget. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where you want to display a loading animation or a placeholder before displaying the actual content.

### Features

*   Delay the rendering of a widget by a specified duration
*   Display a placeholder or loading animation during the delay
*   Supports both Android and iOS platforms

### When to Use

*   Displaying a loading animation before fetching data from an API
*   Showing a placeholder before rendering a complex widget tree
*   Introducing a delay before displaying a widget to improve user experience

# Tutorial: Using the Delayed Widget Package
=============================================

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

Add the `delayed_widget` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  delayed_widget: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

Import the `delayed_widget` package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:delayed_widget/delayed_widget.dart';
```

### Step 3: Use the DelayedWidget

Use the `DelayedWidget` to delay the rendering of a widget:

```dart
DelayedWidget(
  delay: Duration(seconds: 2),
  child: Text('Hello, World!'),
)
```

In this example, the `Text` widget will be rendered after a delay of 2 seconds.

### Platform-Specific Details

The `delayed_widget` package works on both Android and iOS platforms. However, you may need to configure the package differently depending on the platform.

For example, on Android, you may need to add the following configuration to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<application
  ...
  android:hardwareAccelerated="true"
  ...
>
```

This configuration enables hardware acceleration for the app, which can improve performance.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:delayed_widget/delayed_widget.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Delayed Widget Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Delayed Widget Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: DelayedWidget(
            // Step 1: Set the delay duration
            delay: Duration(seconds: 2),
            // Step 2: Set the placeholder or loading animation
            placeholder: CircularProgressIndicator(),
            // Step 3: Set the child widget to be rendered after the delay
            child: Text(
              'Hello, World!',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The app starts and the RealFlutter widget is rendered.
// 2. The DelayedWidget is rendered with a delay of 2 seconds.
// 3. During the delay, the CircularProgressIndicator is displayed as a placeholder.
// 4. After the delay, the Text widget is rendered with the text 'Hello, World!'.
// 5. The Text widget is displayed in the center of the screen.

// In summary, the DelayedWidget is used to delay the rendering of the Text widget by 2 seconds.
// During the delay, a CircularProgressIndicator is displayed as a placeholder.
// After the delay, the Text widget is rendered and displayed in the center of the screen.
