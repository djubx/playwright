This package is particularly useful for developers working on applications that require validation or parsing of Korean text, such as forms, chat applications, or any text-based input that needs to adhere to specific Korean language rules.

## When to Use This Package
- **Input Validation**: When you need to validate user input for Korean characters, such as names, addresses, or any other text fields.
- **Text Parsing**: For applications that need to extract or manipulate Korean text based on specific patterns.
- **Localization**: When developing apps that cater to Korean-speaking users, ensuring that text input adheres to local standards.

## Key Features
- **Comprehensive Regex Patterns**: The package includes a variety of regex patterns specifically designed for Korean characters, including Hangul syllables and Jamo.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate into any Flutter project with minimal setup.
- **Performance Optimized**: Designed to handle regex operations efficiently, making it suitable for real-time applications.

Overall, `korea_regexp` is an essential tool for Flutter developers focusing on Korean language applications, providing robust and efficient regex capabilities.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `korea_regexp`

## Installation
To add the `korea_regexp` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  korea_regexp: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
The `korea_regexp` package is designed to work seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms. There are no additional platform-specific configurations required for basic usage. However, ensure that your Flutter environment is set up correctly for both platforms.

## Basic Usage
Hereâ€™s how to use the `korea_regexp` package in your Flutter application:

1. **Import the Package**: Start by importing the package in your Dart file.

```dart
import 'package:korea_regexp/korea_regexp.dart';
```

2. **Using Regex Patterns**: You can utilize the provided regex patterns to validate or parse Korean text. For example, to check if a string contains valid Korean characters:

```dart
void validateKoreanInput(String input) {
  final isValid = KoreaRegexp.isHangul(input);
  if (isValid) {
    print('Valid Korean input');
  } else {
    print('Invalid Korean input');
  }
}
```

This function checks if the input string consists solely of Hangul characters.

## Conclusion
The `korea_regexp` package is straightforward to set up and use, making it an excellent choice for developers working with Korean text. With its efficient regex patterns, you can easily validate and parse Korean language inputs in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Using `korea_regexp`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:korea_regexp/korea_regexp.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Korean Regex Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Korean Regex Validator'),
        ),
        body: KoreanInputForm(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class KoreanInputForm extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _KoreanInputFormState createState() => _KoreanInputFormState();
}

class _KoreanInputFormState extends State<KoreanInputForm> {
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController();
  String _validationMessage = '';

  // This function validates the input when the button is pressed
  void _validateInput() {
    final input = _controller.text;
    // Check if the input is valid Korean using the regex from the package
    if (KoreaRegexp.isHangul(input)) {
      setState(() {
        _validationMessage = 'Valid Korean input';
      });
    } else {
      setState(() {
        _validationMessage = 'Invalid Korean input';
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
      child: Column(
        children: [
          TextField(
            controller: _controller,
            decoration: InputDecoration(
              labelText: 'Enter Korean Text',
            ),
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20),
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: _validateInput,
            child: Text('Validate'),
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20),
          Text(
            _validationMessage,
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16, color: Colors.red),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget.
// 3. The home widget is a Scaffold containing an AppBar and the KoreanInputForm.
// 4. KoreanInputForm is a stateful widget that manages user input and validation.
// 5. The user enters text in a TextField, which is controlled by _controller.
// 6. When the 'Validate' button is pressed, _validateInput is called.
// 7. _validateInput checks if the input is valid Korean using KoreaRegexp.isHangul.
// 8. The validation message is updated based on the result and displayed below the button.
