# Setting Up the Package

To use the `calendar_day_view` package, follow these steps:

1. Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  calendar_day_view: ^1.0.0
```
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.
3. Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:calendar_day_view/calendar_day_view.dart';
```
## Platform-Specific Details

* For Android, add the following line to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_CALENDAR" />
```

```
## Configurations and Optimizations

* You can customize the calendar view by using the `CalendarDayView` widget's properties, such as `eventBuilder` and `calendarLayout`.
* To optimize performance, use the `CalendarDayView` widget's `cacheExtent` property to limit the number of events loaded at once.

  }
}

// Define the Event class
class Event {
  String title;
  DateTime startTime;
  DateTime endTime;

  Event({this.title, this.startTime, this.endTime});
}
```

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a calendar view.
// 2. The calendar view displays the events for the current day.
// 3. The user can interact with the events by tapping on them.
// 4. The event builder is called to build the event widget.
// 5. The event widget is displayed on the calendar view.
// 6. The user can scroll through the calendar view to view different times of the day.
// 7. The calendar layout is used to determine the start and end times of the calendar view.
