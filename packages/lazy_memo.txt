# Exploring the `lazy_memo` Flutter Package

The `lazy_memo` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to optimize their applications by caching computed values. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where expensive computations are performed, and the results can be reused without recalculating them every time. By leveraging memoization, `lazy_memo` helps improve performance and reduce unnecessary processing.

## When to Use `lazy_memo`
- **Heavy Computations**: When your application performs heavy calculations that can be reused.
- **Data Fetching**: When fetching data from APIs where the results do not change frequently.
- **State Management**: In scenarios where you want to cache the results of stateful computations.

## Key Features
- **Memoization**: Automatically caches the results of function calls based on their input parameters.
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Only computes values when they are needed, which can lead to performance improvements.
- **Simple API**: Easy to integrate and use within your existing Flutter applications.

Overall, `lazy_memo` is an excellent choice for developers looking to enhance the efficiency of their Flutter applications by minimizing redundant computations.

# Setting Up and Using the `lazy_memo` Package

## Installation
To get started with the `lazy_memo` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  lazy_memo: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
The `lazy_memo` package is designed to work seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms. There are no additional configurations required for either platform, making it easy to integrate into your Flutter project.

## Basic Usage
To use the `lazy_memo` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:lazy_memo/lazy_memo.dart';
```

You can then create a memoized function using the `memo` method provided by the package. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
// A function that computes the factorial of a number
int factorial(int n) {
  if (n <= 1) return 1;
  return n * factorial(n - 1);
}

// Memoizing the factorial function
final memoizedFactorial = memo(factorial);
```

Now, every time you call `memoizedFactorial`, it will cache the results based on the input, avoiding redundant calculations.

# Complete Example of Using `lazy_memo`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:lazy_memo/lazy_memo.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Lazy Memo Example',
      home: MemoizationExample(),
    );
  }
}

class MemoizationExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MemoizationExampleState createState() => _MemoizationExampleState();
}

class _MemoizationExampleState extends State<MemoizationExample> {
  int _number = 0; // Variable to hold the input number
  int _result = 1; // Variable to hold the result of the factorial

  // A function that computes the factorial of a number
  int factorial(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return 1; // Base case for recursion
    return n * factorial(n - 1); // Recursive call
  }

  // Memoizing the factorial function
  final memoizedFactorial = memo(factorial);

  // Function to update the result based on the input number
  void _calculateFactorial() {
    setState(() {
      _result = memoizedFactorial(_number); // Call the memoized function
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Lazy Memo Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Enter a number:',
            ),
            Padding(
              padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
              child: TextField(
                keyboardType: TextInputType.number,
                onChanged: (value) {
                  _number = int.tryParse(value) ?? 0; // Update the input number
                },
              ),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _calculateFactorial, // Calculate factorial on button press
              child: Text('Calculate Factorial'),
            ),
            Text(
              'Factorial of $_number is $_result', // Display the result
              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline4,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget (MemoizationExample).
// 3. MemoizationExample is a stateful widget that maintains the input number and the result.
// 4. The factorial function is defined to compute the factorial recursively.
// 5. The memoizedFactorial variable holds the memoized version of the factorial function.
// 6. When the user enters a number and presses the button, _calculateFactorial is called.
// 7. This function updates the state with the result of the memoized factorial calculation.
// 8. The result is displayed on the screen, showing the factorial of the entered number.
