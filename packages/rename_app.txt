The `rename_app` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to simplify the process of renaming your Flutter application across different platforms. This package automates the tedious task of changing the app name, package name, and other related configurations, ensuring that your app is correctly identified in both Android and iOS environments.

You should consider using the `rename_app` package when:
- You are starting a new Flutter project and want to set a specific app name and package name from the beginning.
- You are refactoring an existing Flutter application and need to change the app name or package name.
- You want to ensure that all necessary files and configurations are updated consistently across platforms.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Automatically updates the app name and package name for both Android and iOS.
- **Easy Configuration**: Simple API to set the new app name and package name.
- **Backup Functionality**: Creates backups of the original configuration files before making changes.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Rename App Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `rename_app` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  rename_app: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Configuring the Package

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that the `applicationId` matches the new package name you want to set.

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `ios/Runner.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
2. Select the project in the navigator, then select the target.
3. Update the `Bundle Identifier` to match the new package name.

## Step 3: Using the Package

In your Dart code, you can use the `rename_app` package as follows:

```dart
import 'package:rename_app/rename_app.dart';

void main() async {
  // Initialize the RenameApp class
  final renameApp = RealFlutter();

  // Set the new app name and package name
  await renameApp.rename(
    appName: 'NewAppName',
    packageName: 'com.example.newapp',
  );
}
```

### Important Notes

- Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to modify the project files.
- Always back up your project before running the renaming process to avoid any data loss.

By following these steps, you can easily rename your Flutter application using the `rename_app` package.

# Complete Example of Using the Rename App Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:rename_app/rename_app.dart';

void main() async {
  // Initialize the RenameApp class
  final renameApp = RealFlutter();

  // Set the new app name and package name
  await renameApp.rename(
    appName: 'NewAppName', // The new name of the application
    packageName: 'com.example.newapp', // The new package identifier
  );

  // Run the Flutter application
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'NewAppName', // Title of the application
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Welcome to NewAppName'), // Display the new app name
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'This is the home page of NewAppName!', // Home page content
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the RenameApp class and sets the new app name and package name.
// 2. The Flutter application is then run using the runApp function.
// 3. MyApp is the root widget, which sets up the MaterialApp with the new title.
// 4. MyHomePage is displayed as the home screen, showing a welcome message with the new app name.
