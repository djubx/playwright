# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Comprehensive Utils

## Installation
To add the `comprehensive_utils` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  comprehensive_utils: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if you plan to use file handling features. For example, if you are reading from the device's storage, you may need to add:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to upload images.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
Hereâ€™s how to use some of the key features of the `comprehensive_utils` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:comprehensive_utils/comprehensive_utils.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Comprehensive Utils Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Example of string manipulation
              String original = "  Hello, Flutter!  ";
              String trimmed = StringUtils.trim(original);
              print(trimmed); // Output: "Hello, Flutter!"

              // Example of date formatting
              DateTime now = DateTime.now();
              String formattedDate = DateUtils.formatDate(now);
              print(formattedDate); // Output: "MM/DD/YYYY"
            },
            child: Text('Run Examples'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we demonstrate how to use string manipulation and date formatting features from the `comprehensive_utils` package.

# Complete Example of Comprehensive Utils

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:comprehensive_utils/comprehensive_utils.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Comprehensive Utils Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Comprehensive Utils Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Example of string manipulation
              String original = "  Hello, Flutter!  ";
              String trimmed = StringUtils.trim(original); // Trimming whitespace
              print(trimmed); // Output: "Hello, Flutter!"

              // Example of date formatting
              DateTime now = DateTime.now();
              String formattedDate = DateUtils.formatDate(now); // Formatting current date
              print(formattedDate); // Output: "MM/DD/YYYY"

              // Example of data validation
              String email = "test@example.com";
              bool isValidEmail = ValidatorUtils.isEmail(email); // Validating email
              print(isValidEmail); // Output: true

              // Example of collection utility
              List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
              List<int> doubled = CollectionUtils.doubleList(numbers); // Doubling each number
              print(doubled); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
            },
            child: Text('Run Examples'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title "Comprehensive Utils Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 5. An ElevatedButton is displayed, which, when pressed, executes several utility functions:
//    - It trims a string and prints the result.
//    - It formats the current date and prints it.
//    - It validates an email address and prints whether it's valid.
//    - It doubles the values in a list and prints the new list.
```
