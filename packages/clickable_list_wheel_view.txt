# Complete Example of Clickable List Wheel View

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:clickable_list_wheel_view/clickable_list_wheel_view.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Clickable List Wheel View Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Clickable List Wheel View'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ClickableListWheelView(
            itemCount: 10, // Number of items in the wheel
            itemBuilder: (context, index) {
              return Container(
                height: 50,
                alignment: Alignment.center,
                child: Text(
                  'Item $index',
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
                ),
              );
            },
            onItemTap: (index) {
              // Handle item tap
              ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                SnackBar(content: Text('You selected Item $index')),
              );
            },
            // Customize the appearance
            itemHeight: 50,
            diameterRatio: 2.0,
            perspective: 0.005,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, the ClickableListWheelView is created with 10 items.
// 4. The itemBuilder function defines how each item looks, displaying "Item X" where X is the index.
// 5. The onItemTap callback is triggered when an item is clicked, showing a SnackBar with the selected item.
// 6. The appearance of the wheel can be customized using properties like itemHeight, diameterRatio, and perspective.
```
