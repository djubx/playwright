# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_web_file_selector

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_web_file_selector` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter web application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_web_file_selector` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_web_file_selector: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_web_file_selector).

## Step 2: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_web_file_selector/flutter_web_file_selector.dart';
```

## Step 3: Implement File Selection

You can now implement file selection in your application. Below is a simple example of how to use the package to allow users to select files.

### Platform-Specific Details

- **Web**: The package is designed specifically for web applications, so no additional configurations are needed for Android or iOS.
- **Browser Compatibility**: Ensure that your application is tested across different web browsers to confirm compatibility.

## Step 4: Example Usage

You can create a button that triggers the file selection process. Hereâ€™s a simple implementation:

```dart
void selectFiles() async {
  // Call the file selector
  final result = await FlutterWebFileSelector.openFile(
    acceptedType: 'image/*', // Specify the accepted file types
    multiple: true, // Allow multiple file selection
  );

  // Check if files were selected
  if (result != null) {
    // Process the selected files
    for (var file in result) {
      print('Selected file: ${file.name}');
    }
  } else {
    print('No files selected.');
  }
}
```

This function opens a file selector dialog, allowing users to select images. The selected files are then printed to the console.

With these steps, you can easily integrate the `flutter_web_file_selector` package into your Flutter web application.

# Complete Example of flutter_web_file_selector

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_web_file_selector/flutter_web_file_selector.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Web File Selector Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('File Selector Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: selectFiles, // Trigger file selection on button press
            child: Text('Select Files'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to select files
  void selectFiles() async {
    // Call the file selector
    final result = await FlutterWebFileSelector.openFile(
      acceptedType: 'image/*', // Specify the accepted file types
      multiple: true, // Allow multiple file selection
    );

    // Check if files were selected
    if (result != null) {
      // Process the selected files
      for (var file in result) {
        print('Selected file: ${file.name}'); // Print the name of each selected file
      }
    } else {
      print('No files selected.'); // Inform the user if no files were selected
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the selectFiles() function is called.
// 5. The selectFiles() function opens a file selector dialog, allowing users to select image files.
// 6. If files are selected, their names are printed to the console; otherwise, a message indicates no files were selected.
