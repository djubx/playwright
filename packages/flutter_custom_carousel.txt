# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_custom_carousel

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_custom_carousel` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_custom_carousel: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'

# Complete Example of flutter_custom_carousel

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_custom_carousel/flutter_custom_carousel.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Custom Carousel Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample data for the carousel
    final List<String> images = [
      'https://via.placeholder.com/600x400?text=Image+1',
      'https://via.placeholder.com/600x400?text=Image+2',
      'https://via.placeholder.com/600x400?text=Image+3',
    ];

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Custom Carousel Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          children: [
            // Custom Carousel widget
            CustomCarousel(
              items: images.map((image) {
                return Container(
                  margin: EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
                  child: Image.network(image, fit: BoxFit.cover),
                );
              }).toList(),
              // Set the auto-play duration
              autoPlay: true,
              autoPlayInterval: Duration(seconds: 3),
              // Enable infinite scrolling
              infinite: true,
              // Set the height of the carousel
              height: 400,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets MyApp as the root widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. In RealFlutter, a list of image URLs is created to be displayed in the carousel.
// 4. The Scaffold widget provides a basic structure with an AppBar and a body.
// 5. The CustomCarousel widget is used to display the images, with options for auto-play and infinite scrolling.
// 6. Each image is wrapped in a Container with margin for spacing, and the images are fetched from the network.
// 7. The carousel automatically transitions between images every 3 seconds, providing a smooth user experience.
