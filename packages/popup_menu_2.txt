# Tutorial
==========

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up and using the `popup_menu_2` package in your Flutter app.

## Step 1: Add the Package to Your Pubspec File
---------------------------------------------

To use the `popup_menu_2` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line:
```yml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  popup_menu_2: ^1.0.0
```
## Step 2: Import the Package
---------------------------

Once you have added the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file, you need to import it in your Dart file. Add the following line at the top of your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:popup_menu_2/popup_menu_2.dart';
```
## Step 3: Create a Popup Menu
---------------------------

To create a popup menu, you need to create a `PopupMenu2` widget and pass in a list of `PopupMenu2Item` widgets. Here is an example:
```dart
PopupMenu2(
  child: Text('Show Popup Menu'),
  items: [
    PopupMenu2Item(
      child: Text('Item 1'),
      onPressed: () {
        print('Item 1 pressed');
      },
    ),
    PopupMenu2Item(
      child: Text('Item 2'),
      onPressed: () {
        print('Item 2 pressed');
      },
    ),
  ],
)
```
## Platform-Specific Details
---------------------------

The `popup_menu_2` package works on both Android and iOS platforms. However, there are some platform-specific details to keep in mind:

* On Android, the popup menu will appear as a dropdown menu.
* On iOS, the popup menu will appear as a bottom sheet.

        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The app starts by running the main function, which creates a new instance of the MyApp widget.
// The MyApp widget is a stateless widget that returns a MaterialApp widget.
// The MaterialApp widget is the top-level widget for the app, and it provides a basic material design visual layout structure.
// The home property of the MaterialApp widget is set to the MyHomePage widget, which is the main page of the app.
// The MyHomePage widget is a stateful widget that returns a Scaffold widget.
// The Scaffold widget provides a basic material design visual layout structure, and it is used to create the app's UI.
// The body property of the Scaffold widget is set to a Center widget, which centers its child widget.
// The child widget of the Center widget is a PopupMenu2 widget, which is used to create the popup menu.
// The PopupMenu2 widget takes a list of PopupMenu2Item widgets as its items property.
// Each PopupMenu2Item widget represents a single item in the popup menu, and it has a child property that is used to set the text of the item.
// The onPressed property of each PopupMenu2Item widget is used to set the callback function that is called when the item is pressed.
