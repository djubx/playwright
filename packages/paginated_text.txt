The `paginated_text` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to display large amounts of text in a user-friendly, paginated format. This package is particularly useful for applications that require reading long articles, books, or any extensive text content, allowing users to navigate through pages seamlessly.

## When to Use `paginated_text`

## Key Features
- **Pagination**: Automatically divides text into pages, making it easier for users to read.
- **Customizable Styles**: Allows developers to customize the appearance of text, including font size, color, and padding.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `paginated_text`

## Installation
To get started with the `paginated_text` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  paginated_text: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `paginated_text` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:paginated_text/paginated_text.dart';
```

You can then create a simple paginated text widget as follows:

```dart
PaginatedText(
  text: 'Your long text goes here...',
  pageSize: 1000, // Number of characters per page
  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16, color: Colors.black),
);
```

This will create a paginated text view that divides your long text into pages of 1000 characters each.

### Example Configuration
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set up a paginated text widget in your Flutter app:

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Paginated Text Example')),
    body: PaginatedText(
      text: 'Your long text goes here...',
      pageSize: 1000,
      style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16, color: Colors.black),
    ),
  );
}
```

This setup will display a paginated text view within a basic Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using `paginated_text`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:paginated_text/paginated_text.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Paginated Text Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: PaginatedTextScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PaginatedTextScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Paginated Text Example'),
      ),
      body: PaginatedText(
        text: 'This is a long text that will be paginated. ' * 50, // Sample long text
        pageSize: 1000, // Number of characters per page
        style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16, color: Colors.black), // Text style
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// The home property of the MaterialApp is set to PaginatedTextScreen, which is another StatelessWidget.
// Inside PaginatedTextScreen, we create a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body that contains the PaginatedText widget.
// The PaginatedText widget takes a long string of text, which is repeated to simulate a lengthy document.
// The pageSize is set to 1000 characters, meaning each page will display up to 1000 characters of text.
// The text style is customizable, allowing developers to set the font size and color.
// This structure allows users to read long texts in a paginated format, enhancing readability and user experience.
