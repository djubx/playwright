// This code creates a simple Flutter app that demonstrates how to use the Screen Time API iOS package.
// The app has a simple UI with text fields for start date, end date, and app ID, as well as buttons to request permission, get total screen time, get app screen time, and get app screen times.
// When the user clicks the "Request Permission" button, the app requests permission to access screen time data.
// When the user clicks the "Get Total Screen Time" button, the app gets the total screen time for the specified period and displays it on the screen.
// When the user clicks the "Get App Screen Time" button, the app gets the screen time for the specified app and displays it on the screen.
// When the user clicks the "Get App Screen Times" button, the app gets the screen times for all apps and displays them in a list on the screen.
