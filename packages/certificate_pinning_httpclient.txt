<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Certificate Pinning with the `certificate_pinning_httpclient` Flutter Package

## Overview

The `certificate_pinning_httpclient` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to enhance the security of their applications by implementing certificate pinning. Certificate pinning is a technique used to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks by ensuring that the client only accepts a specific certificate or public key when establishing a secure connection with a server.

### When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `certificate_pinning_httpclient` package in scenarios where:

- Your application communicates with a backend server over HTTPS.
- You want to ensure that the server's identity is verified and that the connection is secure.
- You are dealing with sensitive data that requires an additional layer of security.

### Features

- **Easy Integration**: The package provides a straightforward API for integrating certificate pinning into your Flutter application.
- **Support for Multiple Platforms**: It works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Customizable**: You can specify the certificates or public keys that your application should trust.

By using this package, you can significantly reduce the risk of data breaches and enhance the overall security of your Flutter applications.

## Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `certificate_pinning_httpclient`

### Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `certificate_pinning_httpclient` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  certificate_pinning_httpclient: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version
```

### Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android Configuration

1. **Add Network Security Configuration**: Create a file named `network_security_config.xml` in the `android/app/src/main/res/xml` directory (create the `xml` directory if it doesn't exist).

   ```xml
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
   <network-security-config>
       <domain-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="false">
           <domain includeSubdomains="true">yourdomain.com</domain>
           <trust-anchors>
               <certificates src="@raw/cert" />
           </trust-anchors>
       </domain-config>
   </network-security-config>
   ```

2. **Reference the Configuration in `AndroidManifest.xml`**:

   ```xml
   <application
       ...
       android:networkSecurityConfig="@xml/network_security_config">
   ```

3. **Add Your Certificate**: Place your certificate file (e.g., `cert.pem`) in the `android/app/src/main/res/raw` directory.

#### iOS Configuration

1. **Add Your Certificate**: Drag and drop your certificate file (e.g., `cert.pem`) into the `ios/Runner` directory in Xcode.

2. **Modify `Info.plist`**: Add the following entry to your `Info.plist` file to allow the app to use the certificate:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSExceptionDomains</key>
       <dict>
           <key>yourdomain.com</key>
           <dict>
               <key>NSExceptionAllowsInsecureHTTPLoads</key>
               <false/>
               <key>NSExceptionRequiresForwardSecrecy</key>
               <false/>
               <key>NSIncludesSubdomains</key>
               <true/>
               <key>NSExceptionMinimumTLSVersion</key>
               <string>TLSv1.2</string>
           </dict>
       </dict>
   </dict>
   ```

### Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have configured your project, you can use the `certificate_pinning_httpclient` package in your Flutter application.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:certificate_pinning_httpclient/certificate_pinning_httpclient.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Certificate Pinning Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Certificate Pinning Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Create an instance of the HttpClient with certificate pinning
              final client = CertificatePinningHttpClient(
                certificates: ['cert.pem'], // Specify your certificate
              );

              // Make a GET request
              final response = await client.get(Uri.parse('https://yourdomain.com/api'));

              // Check the response
              if (response.statusCode == 200) {
                print('Response data: ${response.body}');
              } else {
                print('Request failed with status: ${response.statusCode}');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Make Secure Request'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Complete Example: Main File

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:certificate_pinning_httpclient/certificate_pinning_httpclient.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Certificate Pinning Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Certificate Pinning Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Create an instance of the HttpClient with certificate pinning
              final client = CertificatePinningHttpClient(
                certificates: ['cert.pem'], // Specify your certificate
              );

              // Make a GET request
              final response = await client.get(Uri.parse('https://yourdomain.com/api'));

              // Check the response
              if (response.statusCode == 200) {
                print('Response data: ${response.body}');
              } else {
                print('Request failed with status: ${response.statusCode}');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Make Secure Request'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which sets up a MaterialApp.
// 2. The home screen contains an AppBar and a button.
// 3. When the button is pressed, an instance of CertificatePinningHttpClient is created.
// 4. The client is configured to use the specified certificate for secure requests.
// 5. A GET request is made to the specified URL.
// 6. The response is checked; if successful, the response data is printed to the console.
// 7. If the request fails, the status code is printed, indicating an error.
```
