# Tutorial: Setting Up Awesome Place Search

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **awesome_place_search** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the **awesome_place_search** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  awesome_place_search: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys for location services:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show nearby places.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show nearby places.</string>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that we have set up the package, let's implement a simple place search feature in our Flutter app.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:awesome_place_search/awesome_place_search.dart';
```

2. Create a simple UI to search for places:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Place Search Example')),
        body: PlaceSearchWidget(), // Custom widget for place search
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Implement the `PlaceSearchWidget` to handle user input and display results.

This setup will allow you to start using the **awesome_place_search** package in your Flutter application. Make sure to explore the package documentation for more advanced features and configurations.

# Complete Example of Awesome Place Search

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:awesome_place_search/awesome_place_search.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Place Search Example')),
        body: PlaceSearchWidget(), // Custom widget for place search
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Custom widget to handle place search
class PlaceSearchWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PlaceSearchWidgetState createState() => _PlaceSearchWidgetState();
}

class _PlaceSearchWidgetState extends State<PlaceSearchWidget> {
  String _searchQuery = ''; // Variable to hold the search query
  List<Place> _places = []; // List to hold the search results

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        TextField(
          onChanged: (query) {
            setState(() {
              _searchQuery = query; // Update the search query
            });
            _searchPlaces(query); // Call the search function
          },
          decoration: InputDecoration(
            hintText: 'Search for places...',
          ),
        ),
        Expanded(
          child: ListView.builder(
            itemCount: _places.length, // Number of places found
            itemBuilder: (context, index) {
              return ListTile(
                title: Text(_places[index].name), // Display place name
                onTap: () {
                  // Handle place selection
                  _onPlaceSelected(_places[index]);
                },
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }

  // Function to search for places based on the query
  void _searchPlaces(String query) {
    // Simulate a search operation (replace with actual API call)
    if (query.isNotEmpty) {
      // Mock data for demonstration
      _places = [
        Place(name: 'Place 1'),
        Place(name: 'Place 2'),
        Place(name: 'Place 3'),
      ];
    } else {
      _places = []; // Clear results if query is empty
    }
    setState(() {}); // Update the UI
  }

  // Function to handle place selection
  void _onPlaceSelected(Place place) {
    // Navigate to a new screen or perform an action with the selected place
    print('Selected place: ${place.name}');
  }
}

// Class to represent a place
class Place {
  final String name;

  Place({required this.name});
}
```

```
// The application starts by running the RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a simple UI.
// Inside the UI, we have a TextField for user input and a ListView to display search results.
// When the user types in the TextField, the _searchPlaces function is called.
// This function simulates a search operation and updates the _places list.
// The ListView.builder displays the list of places found.
// When a place is tapped, the _onPlaceSelected function is called, which can be used to navigate or perform actions with the selected place.
```
