# Sentry Drift: A Comprehensive Overview

The `sentry_drift` Flutter package is designed to integrate Sentry's error tracking capabilities with Drift, a reactive persistence library for Flutter. This package allows developers to capture and report errors that occur within their Drift database operations, providing a seamless way to monitor and debug issues in applications that rely on local data storage.

## When to Use Sentry Drift
- **Error Monitoring**: If your Flutter application uses Drift for local database management and you want to track errors effectively, Sentry Drift is an excellent choice.
- **Debugging**: It helps in identifying issues related to database operations, making it easier to debug and maintain your application.
- **Production Applications**: For applications in production, having a robust error tracking system is crucial for maintaining user experience and application reliability.

## Key Features
- **Automatic Error Reporting**: Automatically captures and reports errors that occur during database operations.
- **Integration with Sentry**: Leverages Sentry's powerful error tracking and reporting features.
- **Reactive Updates**: Works seamlessly with Drift's reactive data streams, ensuring that errors are reported in real-time.
- **Customizable**: Allows developers to customize error reporting based on their application's needs.

Overall, `sentry_drift` enhances the reliability of Flutter applications by providing essential error tracking capabilities for local database operations.

# Sentry Drift: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with `sentry_drift`, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  sentry_drift: ^latest_version
  drift: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version numbers available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // or higher
    }
}
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following configuration to enable network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
To use `sentry_drift`, you need to initialize Sentry and set up Drift. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';
import 'package:sentry_drift/sentry_drift.dart';
import 'package:drift/drift.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize Sentry
  Sentry.init((options) {
    options.dsn = 'YOUR_SENTRY_DSN';
  });

  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sentry Drift Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}
```

In the above code, replace `'YOUR_SENTRY_DSN'` with your actual Sentry DSN.

Now, you can use Drift with Sentry error tracking in your database operations. For example:

```dart
class MyDatabase extends GeneratedDatabase {
  MyDatabase(QueryExecutor e) : super(e);

  // Define your tables and data models here
}

// Example of a database operation with error handling
Future<void> performDatabaseOperation() async {
  try {
    // Your database operation
  } catch (error, stackTrace) {
    // Report the error to Sentry
    await Sentry.captureException(error, stackTrace: stackTrace);
  }
}
```

This setup allows you to capture and report any errors that occur during database operations, ensuring that you have visibility into issues that may arise in production.

# Complete Example of Sentry Drift in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';
import 'package:sentry_drift/sentry_drift.dart';
import 'package:drift/drift.dart';

// Main entry point of the application
void main() {
  // Initialize Sentry with your DSN
  Sentry.init((options) {
    options.dsn = 'YOUR_SENTRY_DSN'; // Replace with your actual Sentry DSN
  });

  runApp(MyApp()); // Run the Flutter application
}

// Define the main application widget
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sentry Drift Example',
      home: RealFlutter(), // Home widget of the application
    );
  }
}

// Define the RealFlutter widget
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Sentry Drift Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () async {
            // Perform a database operation when the button is pressed
            await performDatabaseOperation();
          },
          child: Text('Perform Database Operation'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Function to perform a database operation with error handling
Future<void> performDatabaseOperation() async {
  try {
    // Simulate a database operation that may throw an error
    throw Exception('Simulated database error'); // Simulated error
  } catch (error, stackTrace) {
    // Report the error to Sentry
    await Sentry.captureException(error, stackTrace: stackTrace);
  }
}
```

```dart
// Explanation of the application flow:

// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which initializes Sentry
//    with the provided DSN and runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a
//    home widget, RealFlutter.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that contains a Scaffold with an AppBar
//    and a Center widget. Inside the Center, there is an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, it calls the performDatabaseOperation() function.
// 5. Inside performDatabaseOperation(), a simulated error is thrown to mimic a
//    database operation failure.
// 6. The error is caught in the catch block, and Sentry.captureException() is
//    called to report the error along with the stack trace to Sentry.
// 7. This allows developers to monitor and debug database-related issues in
//    their Flutter applications effectively.
