# Flutter Overlay Loader: A Comprehensive Guide

The `flutter_overlay_loader` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers, designed to provide a simple and effective way to display loading indicators over the entire screen. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to inform users that a background process is ongoing, such as during data fetching or processing tasks.

## When to Use `flutter_overlay_loader`

You should consider using `flutter_overlay_loader` in the following scenarios:

- **Data Fetching**: When your app is retrieving data from an API and you want to indicate to users that the process is ongoing.
- **Long-Running Tasks**: For operations that take a noticeable amount of time, such as file uploads or downloads.
- **User Feedback**: To provide visual feedback during any operation that may cause a delay in user interaction.

## Features

- **Customizable Loader**: You can customize the appearance of the loader to match your app's theme.
- **Easy Integration**: The package is straightforward to integrate into existing Flutter applications.
- **Overlay Support**: It allows you to display the loader as an overlay, ensuring that it covers the entire screen.

With these features, `flutter_overlay_loader` enhances user experience by providing clear visual feedback during asynchronous operations.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `flutter_overlay_loader`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_overlay_loader` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_overlay_loader: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Basic Usage

### Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_overlay_loader/flutter_overlay_loader.dart';
```

### Displaying the Loader

You can display the loader by calling `Loader.show()` method. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
Loader.show(context);
```

### Hiding the Loader

To hide the loader, use:

```dart
Loader.hide();
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions if you are performing network operations. Typically, you might need:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that you have the correct configurations in your `Info.plist` if you are accessing the internet. You might need to add:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Customizing the Loader

You can customize the loader by passing parameters to the `Loader.show()` method. For example:

```dart
Loader.show(
  context: context,
  progressIndicator: CircularProgressIndicator(), // Custom loader
  overlayColor: Colors.black54, // Background color
);
```

This allows you to tailor the loader's appearance to fit your app's design.

# Complete Example of Using `flutter_overlay_loader`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_overlay_loader/flutter_overlay_loader.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Overlay Loader Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Overlay Loader Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () async {
            // Show the loader when the button is pressed
            Loader.show(context);

            // Simulate a network call or long-running task
            await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3));

            // Hide the loader after the task is complete
            Loader.hide();
          },
          child: Text('Show Loader'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. HomeScreen contains a button that, when pressed, shows the loader.
// 4. The loader is displayed using Loader.show(context).
// 5. A simulated delay (representing a network call) is created using Future.delayed.
// 6. After the delay, Loader.hide() is called to remove the loader from the screen.
// 7. The user can see the loader for 3 seconds before it disappears, providing feedback during the operation.
