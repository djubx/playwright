# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Curved Gradient Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the **curved_gradient** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  curved_gradient: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable certain capabilities in your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file, depending on your app's requirements. However, the **curved_gradient** package does not require any specific configurations beyond the standard Flutter setup.

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a curved gradient background in your app.

# Complete Example: Curved Gradient in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:curved_gradient/curved_gradient.dart'; // Import the curved_gradient package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Curved Gradient Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        body: CurvedGradientBackground(), // Use the custom widget for the background
      ),
    );
  }
}

class CurvedGradientBackground extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      // Create a container to hold the gradient
      decoration: BoxDecoration(
        gradient: CurvedGradient(
          colors: [Colors.blue, Colors.purple], // Define gradient colors
          stops: [0.0, 1.0], // Define stops for the gradient
          curve: Curves.easeInOut, // Define the curve for the gradient
        ),
      ),
      child: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Hello, Curved Gradient!',
          style: TextStyle(
            fontSize: 24,
            color: Colors.white,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home scaffold.
// 3. The CurvedGradientBackground widget is used as the body of the scaffold.
// 4. Inside CurvedGradientBackground, a Container is created with a curved gradient background.
// 5. The gradient is defined with two colors (blue and purple) and a smooth transition curve.
// 6. A centered text widget displays a message on top of the gradient background.
```
