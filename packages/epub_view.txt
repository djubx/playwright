# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the epub_view Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `epub_view` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  epub_view: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/epub_view).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21. You can find this in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to enable the `NSAppTransportSecurity` settings in your `Info.plist` file to allow loading resources from the internet:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `epub_view` package in your app.

# Complete Example of Using the epub_view Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:epub_view/epub_view.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'EPUB Viewer',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: EpubViewerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class EpubViewerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _EpubViewerScreenState createState() => _EpubViewerScreenState();
}

class _EpubViewerScreenState extends State<EpubViewerScreen> {
  // Declare a variable to hold the EPUB book
  EpubController? _epubController;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the EpubController with the EPUB file path
    _epubController = EpubController(
      document: EpubDocument.openAsset('assets/sample.epub'), // Load EPUB from assets
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('EPUB Viewer'),
      ),
      body: EpubView(
        controller: _epubController!, // Pass the controller to the EpubView
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home screen is set to EpubViewerScreen, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 4. In the _EpubViewerScreenState, we initialize the EpubController in initState.
// 5. The EpubController loads an EPUB file from the assets folder.
// 6. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and an EpubView widget.
// 7. The EpubView displays the content of the EPUB file using the controller.
// 8. Users can navigate through the EPUB content using the provided UI.
```
