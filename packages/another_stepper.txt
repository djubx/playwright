Here's a detailed technical blog on the "another_stepper" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Another Stepper Flutter Package

The **Another Stepper** package is a versatile and customizable stepper widget for Flutter applications. It allows developers to create multi-step forms or processes with ease, enhancing user experience by guiding them through a series of steps. This package is particularly useful in scenarios such as onboarding processes, checkout flows, or any situation where user input is required in a sequential manner.

## When to Use This Package
- **Onboarding Flows**: When you want to guide users through the initial setup of your app.
- **Checkout Processes**: For e-commerce applications where users need to fill out multiple forms.
- **Multi-step Forms**: When collecting information that requires several steps, such as surveys or registration forms.

## Features
- **Customizable Steps**: You can easily customize the appearance and behavior of each step.
- **Vertical and Horizontal Orientation**: Supports both orientations, allowing flexibility in design.
- **Dynamic Step Management**: Add, remove, or modify steps dynamically based on user input.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in support for validation and error handling at each step.

With these features, the Another Stepper package provides a robust solution for managing multi-step processes in Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Another Stepper

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the Another Stepper package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  another_stepper: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the Another Stepper in your app.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:another_stepper/another_stepper.dart';
```

2. Create a StatefulWidget to manage the stepper state:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  int currentStep = 0; // Track the current step

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Another Stepper Example')),
      body: AnotherStepper(
        stepperDirection: Axis.vertical, // Set the direction of the stepper
        steps: [
          Step(
            title: Text('Step 1'),
            content: Text('Content for Step 1'),
          ),
          Step(
            title: Text('Step 2'),
            content: Text('Content for Step 2'),
          ),
          Step(
            title: Text('Step 3'),
            content: Text('Content for Step 3'),
          ),
        ],
        currentStep: currentStep,
        onStepContinue: () {
          if (currentStep < 2) {
            setState(() {
              currentStep++;
            });
          } else {
            // Handle completion
            print('All steps completed!');
          }
        },
        onStepCancel: () {
          if (currentStep > 0) {
            setState(() {
              currentStep--;
            });
          }
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Run your application to see the stepper in action.

# Complete Example of Another Stepper

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:another_stepper/another_stepper.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Another Stepper Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  int currentStep = 0; // Track the current step

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Another Stepper Example')),
      body: AnotherStepper(
        stepperDirection: Axis.vertical, // Set the direction of the stepper
        steps: [
          Step(
            title: Text('Step 1'),
            content: Text('Content for Step 1'),
          ),
          Step(
            title: Text('Step 2'),
            content: Text('Content for Step 2'),
          ),
          Step(
            title: Text('Step 3'),
            content: Text('Content for Step 3'),
          ),
        ],
        currentStep: currentStep,
        onStepContinue: () {
          if (currentStep < 2) {
            setState(() {
              currentStep++; // Move to the next step
            });
          } else {
            // Handle completion
            print('All steps completed!'); // Notify completion
          }
        },
        onStepCancel: () {
          if (currentStep > 0) {
            setState(() {
              currentStep--; // Move back to the previous step
            });
          }
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp and points to the RealFlutter widget as the home.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains the current step index.
// 4. The AnotherStepper widget is built with three steps, each having a title and content.
// 5. The current step is tracked by the currentStep variable.
// 6. The onStepContinue callback increments the current step, while onStepCancel decrements it.
// 7. When all steps are completed, a message is printed to the console.
```
