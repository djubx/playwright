# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Gradient Slider

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the gradient_slider package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  gradient_slider: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Gradient Slider

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the gradient slider.

# Complete Example of Gradient Slider

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gradient_slider/gradient_slider.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Gradient Slider Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Gradient Slider Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: GradientSlider(
            min: 0.0, // Minimum value of the slider
            max: 100.0, // Maximum value of the slider
            value: 50.0, // Initial value of the slider
            gradient: LinearGradient( // Gradient background for the slider
              colors: [Colors.blue, Colors.purple],
            ),
            onChanged: (value) {
              // This callback is called when the slider value changes
              print('Slider value: $value');
            },
            divisions: 10, // Number of discrete divisions
            label: 'Value', // Label for the slider
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Gradient Slider Example".
// 4. In the body of the Scaffold, a GradientSlider widget is created.
// 5. The GradientSlider is configured with a minimum and maximum value, an initial value, and a gradient background.
// 6. The onChanged callback prints the current value of the slider to the console whenever the user interacts with it.
// 7. The divisions property allows the slider to have discrete steps, making it easier for users to select specific values.
```
