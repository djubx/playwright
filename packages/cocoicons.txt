# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Cocoicons

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the Cocoicons package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cocoicons: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the Cocoicons package:

```dart
import 'package:cocoicons/cocoicons.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using Cocoicons in Your App

You can now use Cocoicons in your Flutter widgets. Here’s how to implement it in a simple Flutter application.

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

#### iOS

For iOS, make sure to enable the necessary permissions in your `Info.plist` if you are using any features that require them. However, Cocoicons does not require any special permissions.

## Step 4: Customizing Icons

You can customize the icons by changing their size and color. Here’s an example of how to use Cocoicons with customization:

```dart
Icon(
  Cocoicons.home,
  size: 30.0, // Set the size of the icon
  color: Colors.blue, // Set the color of the icon
)
```

With these steps, you are now ready to use the Cocoicons package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Cocoicons in a Flutter App

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cocoicons/cocoicons.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Cocoicons Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Cocoicons Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Displaying a home icon from Cocoicons
            Icon(
              Cocoicons.home,
              size: 50.0, // Icon size
              color: Colors.blue, // Icon color
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between icons
            // Displaying a settings icon from Cocoicons
            Icon(
              Cocoicons.settings,
              size: 50.0, // Icon size
              color: Colors.green, // Icon color
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between icons
            // Displaying a user icon from Cocoicons
            Icon(
              Cocoicons.user,
              size: 50.0, // Icon size
              color: Colors.red, // Icon color
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to HomePage, which is the main screen of the app.
// 4. In HomePage, a Scaffold widget is used to create the basic visual structure.
// 5. The AppBar displays the title of the app.
// 6. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 7. A Column widget is used to arrange the icons vertically.
// 8. Each Icon widget displays an icon from the Cocoicons package, with specified size and color.
// 9. SizedBox widgets are used to add space between the icons for better visual separation.
```
