# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Achievement View

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **achievement_view** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  achievement_view: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:achievement_view/achievement_view.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package

You can now use the **AchievementView** widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to display an achievement notification:

```dart
AchievementView(
  context: context,
  title: "Achievement Unlocked!",
  subTitle: "You have completed the first level.",
  icon: Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.white),
  color: Colors.green,
  listener: (status) {
    print(status);
  },
);
```

This code snippet creates an achievement notification with a title, subtitle, and an icon. The `listener` callback can be used to handle user interactions.

With these steps, you are now ready to implement the **achievement_view** package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Achievement View

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:achievement_view/achievement_view.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Achievement View Example',
      home: AchievementHome(),
    );
  }
}

class AchievementHome extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Achievement View Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Trigger the achievement view when the button is pressed
            AchievementView(
              context: context,
              title: "Achievement Unlocked!",
              subTitle: "You have completed the first level.",
              icon: Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.white),
              color: Colors.green,
              listener: (status) {
                // Handle the achievement view status
                print(status);
              },
            ).show();
          },
          child: Text('Show Achievement'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets AchievementHome as the home widget.
// 3. AchievementHome contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the AchievementView is triggered, displaying an achievement notification.
// 6. The notification includes a title, subtitle, and an icon, and it listens for user interactions.
// 7. The listener prints the status of the achievement view to the console when the user interacts with it.
