To get started with the `mention_tag_text_field` package, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the package dependency.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     mention_tag_text_field: ^latest_version
   ```

   Replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/mention_tag_text_field).

2. **Install Packages**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the correct minimum SDK version. The package requires at least SDK version 21.

     ```gradle
     android {
         ...
         defaultConfig {
             ...
             minSdkVersion 21
         }
     }
     ```

   - **iOS**: Open your `ios/Podfile` and ensure that the platform is set to at least 10.0.

     ```ruby
     platform :ios, '10.0'
     ```

4. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the package:

   ```dart
   import 'package:mention_tag_text_field/mention_tag_text_field.dart';
   ```

## Using the Package

To use the `mention_tag_text_field`, you can create a simple widget that incorporates the mention functionality. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mention_tag_text_field/mention_tag_text_field.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Mention Tag Text Field Example')),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: MentionTagTextField(
            onChanged: (text) {
              // Handle text changes
            },
            suggestionBuilder: (context, suggestion) {
              return ListTile(
                title: Text(suggestion),
              );
            },
            // Additional configurations can be added here
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple app with a text field that allows users to mention tags. The `suggestionBuilder` is used to display suggestions as the user types.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mention_tag_text_field/mention_tag_text_field.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Mention Tag Text Field Example')),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: MentionTagTextField(
            onChanged: (text) {
              // This callback is triggered whenever the text changes
              print('Current text: $text');
            },
            suggestionBuilder: (context, suggestion) {
              // This builder is used to create the suggestion list
              return ListTile(
                title: Text(suggestion),
              );
            },
            // You can customize the text field further here
            decoration: InputDecoration(
              hintText: 'Type something...',
              border: OutlineInputBorder(),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with a title.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Padding widget that adds space around the text field.
// 5. The MentionTagTextField is initialized, allowing users to type and mention tags.
// 6. The onChanged callback prints the current text to the console whenever the text changes.
// 7. The suggestionBuilder creates a ListTile for each suggestion, displaying it in the dropdown.
// 8. The text field is styled with a hint and an outline border for better user experience.
