The final summary is that the code flows by first getting the current system locale, then listening for locale changes, and updating the UI accordingly. The user can also set a custom locale, which is then used to update the UI. The app uses the `fts_system_locale` package to access and manage system locales, making it easy to adapt to different locales and languages.
