# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Draggable Scrollbar Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To use the `draggable_scrollbar` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  draggable_scrollbar: ^0.0.5
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:draggable_scrollbar/draggable_scrollbar.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Setup

You can use the `DraggableScrollbar` widget to wrap your scrollable widget (like `ListView`). Here’s a basic example:

```dart
DraggableScrollbar.semicircle(
  child: ListView.builder(
    itemCount: 100,
    itemBuilder: (context, index) {
      return ListTile(title: Text('Item $index'));
    },
  ),
)
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 9.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
```

## Step 4: Customization

You can customize the scrollbar's appearance by using properties like `backgroundColor`, `thumbColor`, and `thickness`. Here’s an example:

```dart
DraggableScrollbar.rrect(
  backgroundColor: Colors.grey,
  thumbColor: Colors.blue,
  thickness: 8.0,
  child: ListView.builder(
    itemCount: 100,
    itemBuilder: (context, index) {
      return ListTile(title: Text('Item $index'));
    },
  ),
)
```

This setup will give you a draggable scrollbar with a rounded rectangle shape, a grey background, and a blue thumb.

# Complete Example of Draggable Scrollbar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:draggable_scrollbar/draggable_scrollbar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Draggable Scrollbar Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Draggable Scrollbar Example'),
        ),
        body: DraggableScrollbar.rrect(
          // Customizing the scrollbar appearance
          backgroundColor: Colors.grey, // Background color of the scrollbar
          thumbColor: Colors.blue, // Color of the draggable thumb
          thickness: 8.0, // Thickness of the scrollbar
          child: ListView.builder(
            itemCount: 100, // Number of items in the list
            itemBuilder: (context, index) {
              return ListTile(
                title: Text('Item $index'), // Displaying item index
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Draggable Scrollbar Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold uses the DraggableScrollbar.rrect widget to create a draggable scrollbar.
// 5. The ListView.builder creates a list of 100 items, each represented by a ListTile displaying its index.
// 6. The scrollbar is customizable with background color, thumb color, and thickness, enhancing the user experience.
