# Live Cells Flutter Package

The **live_cells** Flutter package is designed to create dynamic and interactive cell-based applications, making it ideal for developers looking to implement features like live data updates, grid layouts, and responsive UI elements. This package is particularly useful in scenarios such as:

- Building dashboards that display real-time data.
- Creating games or simulations that require a grid-based layout.
- Developing applications that need to reflect changes in data instantly.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Cell Updates**: Automatically refreshes cell data without needing to rebuild the entire widget tree.
- **Customizable Cell Layouts**: Offers flexibility in designing how cells are displayed and interacted with.
- **Efficient State Management**: Utilizes Flutter's built-in state management capabilities to ensure smooth performance.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

With these features, the live_cells package empowers developers to create engaging and responsive applications that can handle real-time data efficiently.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Live Cells Package

## Installation

To get started with the live_cells package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and include the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  live_cells: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage

To use the live_cells package, you will typically create a `RealFlutter` widget that utilizes the package's features. Below is a simple example of how to implement a grid of live cells.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:live_cells/live_cells.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Live Cells Example')),
        body: LiveCellsGrid(
          rows: 5,
          columns: 5,
          cellBuilder: (context, row, column) {
            return Cell(
              child: Center(child: Text('Cell $row, $column')),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple grid with 5 rows and 5 columns, where each cell displays its position.

# Complete Example of Live Cells in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:live_cells/live_cells.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Live Cells Example')),
        body: LiveCellsGrid(
          rows: 5, // Define the number of rows in the grid
          columns: 5, // Define the number of columns in the grid
          cellBuilder: (context, row, column) {
            // Build each cell dynamically
            return Cell(
              child: Center(child: Text('Cell $row, $column')), // Display cell position
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a body with a LiveCellsGrid.
// 4. The LiveCellsGrid is configured with 5 rows and 5 columns.
// 5. Each cell is built using the cellBuilder function, which displays the cell's position.
// 6. The app is responsive and can handle dynamic updates to the cell data.
