# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using tflite_flutter_helper_plus

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `tflite_flutter_helper_plus` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `tflite_flutter_helper_plus` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  tflite_flutter_helper_plus: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/tflite_flutter_helper_plus).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update Android Gradle Version**: Ensure your `android/build.gradle` file has the following:

   ```groovy
   buildscript {
       ext.kotlin_version = '1.5.31' // or latest
       repositories {
           google()
           mavenCentral()
       }
       dependencies {
           classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.0.2' // or latest
           classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:$kotlin_version"
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Enable Multidex**: In your `android/app/build.gradle`, add:

   ```groovy
   android {
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           multiDexEnabled true
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update iOS Deployment Target**: Open your `ios/Podfile` and set the platform version:

   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0' # or higher
   ```

2. **Install CocoaPods**: Run the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   cd ios
   pod install
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in our Flutter application.

1. **Import the Package**:

   ```dart
   import 'package:tflite_flutter_helper_plus/tflite_flutter_helper_plus.dart';
   ```

2. **Load a Model**: Use the `Interpreter` class to load your TensorFlow Lite model.

3. **Prepare Input and Output**: Use the helper methods to prepare your input data and process the output.

4. **Run Inference**: Call the `runForMultipleInputs` method to perform inference.

This setup will allow you to leverage TensorFlow Lite models in your Flutter applications effectively.

# Complete Example: Using tflite_flutter_helper_plus

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tflite_flutter_helper_plus/tflite_flutter_helper_plus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'TFLite Flutter Helper Plus Example',
      home: ModelInferenceScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ModelInferenceScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ModelInferenceScreenState createState() => _ModelInferenceScreenState();
}

class _ModelInferenceScreenState extends State<ModelInferenceScreen> {
  late Interpreter _interpreter; // Interpreter for running the model
  String _result = "No result yet"; // Variable to hold inference result

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _loadModel(); // Load the model when the widget is initialized
  }

  // Function to load the TensorFlow Lite model
  Future<void> _loadModel() async {
    // Load the model from assets
    _interpreter = await Interpreter.fromAsset('model.tflite');
  }

  // Function to run inference
  void _runInference() {
    // Prepare input data (example: a 1D array)
    var input = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]; // Example input data
    var output = List.filled(3, 0).reshape([1, 3]); // Prepare output buffer

    // Run the model
    _interpreter.run(input, output);

    // Update the result variable with the output
    setState(() {
      _result = output[0].toString();
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('TFLite Flutter Helper Plus Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Inference Result: $_result'), // Display the result
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _runInference, // Run inference on button press
              child: Text('Run Inference'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _interpreter.close(); // Close the interpreter when done
    super.dispose();
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The ModelInferenceScreen widget is created, which initializes the interpreter in initState.
// 4. The _loadModel function loads the TensorFlow Lite model from assets.
// 5. When the user presses the "Run Inference" button, the _runInference function is called.
// 6. Input data is prepared, and the model is run using the interpreter.
// 7. The output is displayed on the screen, updating the state with the result.
// 8. The interpreter is closed when the widget is disposed to free resources.
```
