# Complete Example of Using the `colours` Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:colours/colours.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Define a primary color using the colours package
    Color primaryColor = Colours.blue;

    // Create lighter and darker variations of the primary color
    Color lightColor = primaryColor.lighten(0.2);
    Color darkColor = primaryColor.darken(0.2);

    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Colours Package Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primaryColor: primaryColor,
        accentColor: lightColor,
      ),
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Colours Package Example'),
          backgroundColor: primaryColor,
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Display the primary color
              Container(
                width: 100,
                height: 100,
                color: primaryColor,
                child: Center(child: Text('Primary', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white))),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Display the lightened color
              Container(
                width: 100,
                height: 100,
                color: lightColor,
                child: Center(child: Text('Light', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.black))),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Display the darkened color
              Container(
                width: 100,
                height: 100,
                color: darkColor,
                child: Center(child: Text('Dark', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white))),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The primary color is defined using the colours package.
// 4. Light and dark variations of the primary color are created.
// 5. The Scaffold widget provides the structure of the app, including an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 6. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange three colored containers vertically.
// 7. Each container displays the primary, lightened, and darkened colors with appropriate text.
// 8. The app showcases how to use the colours package to manage and display colors effectively.
