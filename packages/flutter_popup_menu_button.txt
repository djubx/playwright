    );
  }
}

// 2. The RealFlutter class builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a PopupMenuButton is created.
// 5. The onSelected callback handles the user's selection and shows a SnackBar with the selected option.
// 6. The itemBuilder defines the menu items that will be displayed in the popup.
// 7. An ElevatedButton is used as the trigger for the popup menu, which is styled and labeled "Show Menu".
