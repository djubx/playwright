# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `request_easy_loading`

## Installation
To add the `request_easy_loading` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  request_easy_loading: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions if you are performing network operations. Typically, you may need:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` file to allow network requests, especially if you are using HTTP instead of HTTPS:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `request_easy_loading` package, you need to initialize it in your main application file. Here’s how to do it:

1. Import the package.
2. Initialize the loading manager.
3. Use the provided methods to show and hide loading indicators.

Here’s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:request_easy_loading/request_easy_loading.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Request Easy Loading Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () async {
            // Show loading indicator
            await RequestEasyLoading.show();
            // Simulate a network request
            await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));
            // Hide loading indicator
            RequestEasyLoading.hide();
          },
          child: Text('Fetch Data'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, a loading indicator is displayed for 2 seconds to simulate a network request.

# Complete Example of `request_easy_loading`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:request_easy_loading/request_easy_loading.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Initialize the loading manager
    RequestEasyLoading.init();
    
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Request Easy Loading Demo',
      builder: (context, child) {
        // Wrap the app with the loading manager
        return RequestEasyLoading(child: child);
      },
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () async {
            // Show loading indicator
            await RequestEasyLoading.show();
            // Simulate a network request
            await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));
            // Hide loading indicator
            RequestEasyLoading.hide();
          },
          child: Text('Fetch Data'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp initializes the RequestEasyLoading manager and wraps the MaterialApp with it.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is displayed, containing a button.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the loading indicator is shown using RequestEasyLoading.show().
// 5. A simulated network request is made with a 2-second delay.
// 6. After the delay, the loading indicator is hidden using RequestEasyLoading.hide().
// 7. The user sees the loading indicator while the simulated request is in progress, enhancing the user experience.
