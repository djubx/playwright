# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `map_location_picker`

## Installation
To get started with the `map_location_picker` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  map_location_picker: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/map_location_picker).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/>
```

2. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21.

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request location permissions:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show nearby places.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to provide better services.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `map_location_picker`, you can create a simple widget that allows users to pick a location. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:map_location_picker/map_location_picker.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Location Picker Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Open the map location picker
              final selectedLocation = await showLocationPicker(
                context,
                'YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY',
                initialCenter: LatLng(37.42796133580664, -122.085749655962),
                myLocationButtonEnabled: true,
                layersButtonEnabled: true,
              );

              // Handle the selected location
              if (selectedLocation != null) {
                print('Selected location: ${selectedLocation.lat}, ${selectedLocation.lng}');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Pick a Location'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, the map location picker opens, allowing the user to select a location. The selected location's latitude and longitude are printed to the console.

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:map_location_picker/map_location_picker.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Location Picker Example')),

              // Open the map location picker
              final selectedLocation = await showLocationPicker(
                context,
                'YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY', // Replace with your Google Maps API key
                initialCenter: LatLng(37.42796133580664, -122.085749655962), // Initial center of the map
                myLocationButtonEnabled: true, // Enable the button to go to the user's location
                layersButtonEnabled: true, // Enable layers button for map options
              );

              // Handle the selected location
              if (selectedLocation != null) {
                // Print the selected location's latitude and longitude
                print('Selected location: ${selectedLocation.lat}, ${selectedLocation.lng}');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Pick a Location'), // Button text
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application starts with the RealFlutter widget.
// The main function runs the app, displaying a button to pick a location.
// When the button is pressed, the map location picker opens.
// The user can select a location on the map.
// After selection, the latitude and longitude of the chosen location are printed to the console.
```
<!-- END_MAIN -->
```

### Summary of Application Flow
- The application starts with the `RealFlutter` widget, which contains a button labeled "Pick a Location."
- When the button is pressed, the `showLocationPicker` function is called, opening the map interface.
- The map is centered at a specified latitude and longitude, and options for the user's current location and map layers are available.
- After the user selects a location, the latitude and longitude are printed to the console, allowing further processing or storage as needed.

This example demonstrates how to effectively use the `map_location_picker` package to integrate location selection into a Flutter application, providing a seamless user experience.
