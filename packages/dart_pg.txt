# Overview of the dart_pg Flutter Package

The `dart_pg` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to interact with PostgreSQL databases. It provides a straightforward API for connecting to PostgreSQL, executing queries, and managing database transactions. This package is particularly useful for applications that require robust data storage and retrieval capabilities, such as e-commerce platforms, content management systems, and any app that needs to handle complex data relationships.

## Key Features
- **Connection Management**: Easily connect to PostgreSQL databases with support for connection pooling.
- **Query Execution**: Execute SQL queries and retrieve results in a structured format.
- **Transaction Support**: Manage database transactions to ensure data integrity.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in error handling for database operations.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.

## When to Use
Consider using `dart_pg` when:
- You need to perform complex queries on a PostgreSQL database.
- Your application requires reliable data storage and retrieval.
- You want to leverage the power of PostgreSQL's advanced features like JSONB, arrays, and full-text search.

# Setting Up and Using the dart_pg Package

## Installation
To get started with the `dart_pg` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dart_pg: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/dart_pg).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21.
2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml` if you are accessing the internet.

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following lines to allow network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `dart_pg` package, you need to create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class, which will handle the database connection and operations.

```dart
import 'package:dart_pg/dart_pg.dart';

class RealFlutter {
  final String connectionString;
  late final PgConnection connection;

  RealFlutter(this.connectionString);

  Future<void> connect() async {
    connection = await PgConnection.open(connectionString);
  }

  Future<List<Map<String, dynamic>>> query(String sql) async {
    return await connection.query(sql);
  }

  Future<void> close() async {
    await connection.close();
  }
}
```

In this example, the `RealFlutter` class manages the connection to the PostgreSQL database and provides methods for querying and closing the connection.

# Complete Example of Using dart_pg

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dart_pg/dart_pg.dart';

class RealFlutter {
  final String connectionString;
  late final PgConnection connection;

  RealFlutter(this.connectionString);

  // Method to connect to the PostgreSQL database
  Future<void> connect() async {
    connection = await PgConnection.open(connectionString);
  }

  // Method to execute a query and return results
  Future<List<Map<String, dynamic>>> query(String sql) async {
    return await connection.query(sql);
  }

  // Method to close the database connection
  Future<void> close() async {
    await connection.close();
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dart PG Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Dart PG Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: FutureBuilder(
            future: fetchData(),
            builder: (context, snapshot) {
              if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                return CircularProgressIndicator(); // Show loading indicator
              } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
                return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}'); // Show error message
              } else {
                return Text('Data: ${snapshot.data}'); // Display fetched data
              }
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to fetch data from the database
  Future<List<Map<String, dynamic>>> fetchData() async {
    final db = RealFlutter('postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/mydb'); // Connection string
    await db.connect(); // Connect to the database
    final results = await db.query('SELECT * FROM my_table'); // Execute query
    await db.close(); // Close the connection
    return results; // Return the results
  }
}
```

```dart
// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application that connects to a PostgreSQL database using the dart_pg package.
// 
// 1. The `RealFlutter` class is defined to manage the database connection and operations.
// 2. The `main` function initializes the Flutter app and sets up the UI.
// 3. The `MyApp` widget builds the main interface, which includes a FutureBuilder to handle asynchronous data fetching.
// 4. The `fetchData` function creates an instance of `RealFlutter`, connects to the database, executes a query to fetch data from `my_table`, and then closes the connection.
// 5. The FutureBuilder displays a loading indicator while waiting for data, shows an error message if an error occurs, or displays the fetched data once available.
