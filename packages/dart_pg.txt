// 1. The `main` function is called, which creates a PostgreSQL database connection using the `PgConnection` class.
// 2. The `connect` method is called to connect to the PostgreSQL database.
// 3. A table is created using the `execute` method.
// 4. Data is inserted into the table using the `execute` method.
// 5. Data is updated in the table using the `execute` method.
// 6. Data is queried from the table using the `query` method.
// 7. The database connection is closed using the `close` method.
// 8. The Flutter app is run using the `runApp` function.
// 9. The `RealFlutterApp` widget is built, which displays a simple "Hello, World!" message.
