<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>

# Complete Example: Using Camera Gallery Image Picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:camera_gallery_image_picker/camera_gallery_image_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Camera Gallery Image Picker Example',
      home: ImagePickerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ImagePickerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ImagePickerScreenState createState() => _ImagePickerScreenState();
}

class _ImagePickerScreenState extends State<ImagePickerScreen> {
  // Variable to hold the selected image
  String? _imagePath;

  // Function to pick an image from the gallery or camera
  void _pickImage() async {
    // Show the image picker dialog
    final pickedFile = await CameraGalleryImagePicker.pickImage(
      context: context,
      source: ImageSource.gallery, // Change to ImageSource.camera to use the camera
    );

    // Check if an image was selected
    if (pickedFile != null) {
      setState(() {
        _imagePath = pickedFile.path; // Update the image path
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Image Picker Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the selected image if available
            _imagePath != null
                ? Image.file(File(_imagePath!))
                : Text('No image selected.'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _pickImage, // Call the image picker function
              child: Text('Pick Image'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets ImagePickerScreen as the home.
// 3. ImagePickerScreen is a stateful widget that manages the selected image state.
// 4. The _pickImage function is called when the user presses the "Pick Image" button.
// 5. The image picker dialog is displayed, allowing the user to select an image from the gallery.
// 6. If an image is selected, the state is updated, and the image is displayed on the screen.
// 7. If no image is selected, a message is shown indicating that no image is selected.
```
