# Gaimon Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Step 1: Adding Gaimon to Your Project

To get started with Gaimon, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  gaimon: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if your application requires specific capabilities. For example, if you are using features that require camera access, add:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera for game features.</string>
```

## Step 3: Importing Gaimon

In your Dart files, import the Gaimon package:

```dart
import 'package:gaimon/gaimon.dart';
```

## Step 4: Basic Usage

You can now start using Gaimon in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initialize Gaimon and create a basic game state.

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: GameHome(),
    );
  }
}

class GameHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _GameHomeState createState() => _GameHomeState();
}

class _GameHomeState extends State<GameHome> {
  // Initialize Gaimon
  final GaimonController _controller = GaimonController();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _controller.initialize();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Gaimon Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to Gaimon!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code initializes Gaimon and sets up a basic Flutter application with a welcome message.

# Complete Example of Gaimon in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gaimon/gaimon.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Gaimon Example',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: GameHome(),
    );
  }
}

class GameHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _GameHomeState createState() => _GameHomeState();
}

class _GameHomeState extends State<GameHome> {
  // Create a Gaimon controller to manage game states
  final GaimonController _controller = GaimonController();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the Gaimon controller
    _controller.initialize();
  }

  // Method to handle user input
  void _onUserAction() {
    // Update the game state based on user action
    _controller.updateState();
    // Trigger an animation or effect
    _controller.triggerAnimation();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Gaimon Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Welcome to Gaimon!'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _onUserAction, // Handle user action
              child: Text('Start Game'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. GameHome is the main screen of the application.
// 4. In the GameHome state, a GaimonController is created to manage game states.
// 5. The controller is initialized in the initState method.
// 6. The build method creates a simple UI with a welcome message and a button.
// 7. When the button is pressed, the _onUserAction method is called, which updates the game state and triggers an animation.
```
