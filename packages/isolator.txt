# Isolator Flutter Package: A High-Level Overview
=====================================================

The Isolator Flutter package is a powerful tool for isolating and managing background tasks in Flutter applications. It allows developers to run computationally intensive tasks in the background, without affecting the performance of the main UI thread.

### When to Use Isolator

Isolator is particularly useful when:

* Performing network requests or database operations that may take a significant amount of time
* Running CPU-intensive tasks, such as image processing or data compression
* Handling background tasks, such as notifications or location updates

### Features of Isolator

* Supports both Android and iOS platforms
* Allows for easy communication between the main UI thread and background isolates
* Provides a simple and intuitive API for creating and managing isolates

# Setting Up and Using Isolator
=============================

### Step 1: Add the Isolator Package to Your Project

Add the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  isolator: ^1.0.0
```
Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Create an Isolate

Create a new file, `isolates.dart`, and add the following code:
```dart
import 'package:isolator/isolator.dart';

class MyIsolate extends Isolate {
  @override
  void run() {
    // Perform some background task here
    print('Hello from isolate!');
  }
}
```
### Step 3: Create and Start the Isolate

In your main file, `main.dart`, add the following code:
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:isolator/isolator.dart';
import 'isolates.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Isolator Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              MyIsolate isolate = MyIsolate();
              isolate.start();
            },
            child: Text('Start Isolate'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
### Platform-Specific Details

* Android: Make sure to add the `android.permission.INTERNET` permission to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file if you plan to use the isolate for network requests.
* iOS: No additional setup is required.

```dart
// main.dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:isolator/isolator.dart';

// Define a new isolate class
class RealFlutterIsolate extends Isolate {
  // This method will be executed in the background
  @override
  void run() {
    // Simulate some background task
    print('Starting background task...');
    Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 5), () {
      print('Background task completed!');
    });
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Isolator Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Create and start the isolate
              RealFlutterIsolate isolate = RealFlutterIsolate();
              isolate.start();
            },
            child: Text('Start Isolate'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The following comments explain the flow of the application:

// 1. The user presses the 'Start Isolate' button, which creates a new instance of the RealFlutterIsolate class.
// 2. The start() method is called on the isolate instance, which executes the run() method in the background.
// 3. The run() method simulates a background task by printing a message to the console and then delaying for 5 seconds.
// 4. After the delay, the background task is completed and another message is printed to the console.
// 5. Meanwhile, the main UI thread remains responsive and the user can continue interacting with the app.

// Summary: This code demonstrates how to create and use an isolate in a Flutter app to perform background tasks without affecting the main UI thread.
