# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_elastic_list_view

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_elastic_list_view` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_elastic_list_view` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_elastic_list_view: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple Flutter application that utilizes the `flutter_elastic_list_view`. 

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_elastic_list_view/flutter_elastic_list_view.dart';
```

2. Create a basic Flutter app structure and use the `ElasticListView` widget to display a list of items.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_elastic_list_view/flutter_elastic_list_view.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Elastic List View Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Elastic List View'),
        ),
        body: ElasticListView(
          // The list of items to display
          children: List.generate(50, (index) {
            return Container(
              height: 100, // Fixed height for each item
              color: index.isEven ? Colors.blue : Colors.green,
              alignment: Alignment.center,
              child: Text(
                'Item $index',
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
              ),
            );
          }),
          // Customize the elastic effect
          elasticEffect: ElasticEffect(
            stretch: 50, // Amount of stretch
            bounce: 0.5, // Bounce effect
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body uses the ElasticListView widget to display a list of 50 items.
// 5. Each item is a Container with a fixed height and alternating colors.
// 6. The elastic effect is customized with stretch and bounce parameters.
// 7. When the user scrolls, the list will exhibit an elastic effect, enhancing the user experience.
```
