# TiledJSONReader: A Flutter Package for Efficient JSON Handling

The **tiledjsonreader** package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who need to work with Tiled JSON files, commonly used in game development and mapping applications. This package simplifies the process of reading and parsing Tiled JSON data, allowing developers to focus on building their applications rather than dealing with the intricacies of JSON parsing.

## When to Use TiledJSONReader
- **Game Development**: When you need to load and manage tile maps for 2D games.
- **Mapping Applications**: For applications that require dynamic map rendering based on JSON data.
- **Data-Driven UIs**: When your UI needs to adapt based on external JSON configurations.

## Key Features
- **Easy Parsing**: Simplifies the process of reading Tiled JSON files.
- **Tile Management**: Provides utilities for managing tiles and layers effectively.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Designed to handle large JSON files efficiently.

With these features, the **tiledjsonreader** package is an excellent choice for developers looking to integrate Tiled JSON data into their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using TiledJSONReader

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **tiledjsonreader** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Package to Your Project

To get started, you need to add the **tiledjsonreader** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  tiledjsonreader: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configurations

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using TiledJSONReader

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in our Flutter application. The following sections will guide you through loading a Tiled JSON file and rendering it.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:
   ```dart
   import 'package:tiledjsonreader/tiledjsonreader.dart';
   ```

2. Load a Tiled JSON file:
   You can load a Tiled JSON file from your assets or from a network source. Make sure to include the JSON file in your `pubspec.yaml` under assets if you are using local files.

3. Parse the JSON data:
   Use the `TiledJsonReader` class to read and parse the JSON data.

With these steps, you are ready to integrate Tiled JSON data into your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Using TiledJSONReader

Below is a complete Flutter application that demonstrates how to use the **tiledjsonreader** package effectively.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tiledjsonreader/tiledjsonreader.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Tiled JSON Reader Example',
      home: TiledMapScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class TiledMapScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _TiledMapScreenState createState() => _TiledMapScreenState();
}

class _TiledMapScreenState extends State<TiledMapScreen> {
  late TiledMap _tiledMap; // Declare a variable to hold the TiledMap data

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    loadTiledMap(); // Load the Tiled JSON map when the widget initializes
  }

  Future<void> loadTiledMap() async {
    // Load the Tiled JSON file from assets
    String jsonString = await DefaultAssetBundle.of(context).loadString('assets/map.json');
    
    // Parse the JSON string into a TiledMap object
    _tiledMap = TiledJsonReader.fromJson(jsonString);
    
    // Call setState to rebuild the UI with the loaded map
    setState(() {});
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Tiled JSON Map'),
      ),
      body: _tiledMap != null
          ? CustomPaint(
              painter: TiledMapPainter(_tiledMap), // Custom painter to render the map
              child: Container(),
            )
          : Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator()), // Show loading indicator while the map is loading
    );
  }
}

// Custom painter class to render the TiledMap
class TiledMapPainter extends CustomPainter {
  final TiledMap tiledMap;

  TiledMapPainter(this.tiledMap);

  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    // Render the tiles on the canvas
    for (var layer in tiledMap.layers) {
      for (var tile in layer.tiles) {
        // Draw each tile based on its properties
        // (This is a simplified example; you would typically use images for tiles)
        canvas.drawRect(
          Rect.fromLTWH(tile.x.toDouble(), tile.y.toDouble(), tile.width.toDouble(), tile.height.toDouble()),
          Paint()..color = Colors.green, // Example color for tiles
        );
      }
    }
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(covariant CustomPainter oldDelegate) {
    return true; // Repaint whenever the TiledMap changes
  }
}
```

// The application starts by running the RealFlutter widget.
// In the RealFlutter widget, we set up a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// The TiledMapScreen is a stateful widget that loads a Tiled JSON map.
// In the initState method, we call loadTiledMap to read the JSON file from assets.
// The loadTiledMap method uses the DefaultAssetBundle to load the JSON string and then parses it into a TiledMap object.
// Once the map is loaded, we call setState to update the UI.
// In the build method, we check if the _tiledMap is not null; if it is loaded, we use a CustomPaint widget to render the map.
// The TiledMapPainter class is responsible for drawing the tiles on the canvas.
// It iterates through the layers and tiles of the TiledMap and draws them on the screen.
// If the map is still loading, we display a CircularProgressIndicator to inform the user.
