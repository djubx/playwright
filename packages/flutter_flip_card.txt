    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `flutter_flip_card` package, you can create a simple flip card widget as follows:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_flip_card/flutter_flip_card.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flip Card Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: FlipCard(
          front: Container(
            width: 200,
            height: 300,
            color: Colors.blue,
            child: Center(child: Text('Front', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24))),
          ),
          back: Container(
            width: 200,
            height: 300,
            color: Colors.red,
            child: Center(child: Text('Back', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24))),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code creates a simple flip card with a blue front and a red back. Tapping the card will flip it to reveal the other side.

# Complete Example of Flutter Flip Card

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_flip_card/flutter_flip_card.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Flip Card Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flip Card Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: FlipCard(
          front: Container(
            width: 200, // Set the width of the front side
            height: 300, // Set the height of the front side
            color: Colors.blue, // Background color of the front side
            child: Center(
              child: Text(
                'Front', // Text displayed on the front side
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24), // Text style
              ),
            ),
          ),
          back: Container(
            width: 200, // Set the width of the back side
            height: 300, // Set the height of the back side
            color: Colors.red, // Background color of the back side
            child: Center(
              child: Text(
                'Back', // Text displayed on the back side
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24), // Text style
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a FlipCard is created with two sides: front and back.
// 5. The front side displays a blue container with the text "Front".
// 6. The back side displays a red container with the text "Back".
// 7. Tapping the card will trigger the flip animation, revealing the other side.
