# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Apple Product Name Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **apple_product_name** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  apple_product_name: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your iOS project in Xcode by navigating to the `ios` folder of your Flutter project.
2. Ensure that your `Info.plist` file includes any necessary permissions for the features you plan to use. For example, if you are using Apple Pay, you might need to add:

```xml
<key>NSAppleMusicUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to Apple Music.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your photo library.</string>
```

3. Make sure to enable the required capabilities in your Xcode project settings, such as Apple Pay or HealthKit.

### Android Configuration

While the package is primarily for iOS, ensure your Android project is set up correctly by checking your `android/app/build.gradle` file for any necessary configurations.

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initialize and use the **RealFlutter** class from the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:apple_product_name/apple_product_name.dart';

class RealFlutter {
  // Initialize the package
  void initialize() {
    // Code to initialize the package
  }

  // Example method to use a feature
  void useFeature() {
    // Code to use a specific feature
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Using the Apple Product Name Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:apple_product_name/apple_product_name.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Apple Product Name Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  // Create an instance of the RealFlutter class
  final RealFlutter realFlutter = RealFlutter();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the package when the screen loads
    realFlutter.initialize();
  }

  // Method to handle feature usage
  void _useFeature() {
    realFlutter.useFeature();
    // Show a message after using the feature
    ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
      SnackBar(content: Text('Feature used successfully!')),
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Apple Product Name Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _useFeature, // Call the feature usage method
          child: Text('Use Apple Feature'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. HomeScreen is a stateful widget that initializes the RealFlutter class.
// 4. In initState, the initialize method of RealFlutter is called to set up the package.
// 5. The UI consists of a button that, when pressed, calls the _useFeature method.
// 6. The _useFeature method uses a feature from the RealFlutter class and shows a SnackBar message upon success.
```
