# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the info_popup Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `info_popup` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  info_popup: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` file to allow for pop-up notifications. Add the following key:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create an info pop-up.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:info_popup/info_popup.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Info Popup Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Show the info popup when the button is pressed
              showInfoPopup(context);
            },
            child: Text('Show Info Popup'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void showInfoPopup(BuildContext context) {
    InfoPopup(
      title: 'Information',
      content: 'This is an example of an info popup.',
      context: context,
      onDismiss: () {
        // Action to perform when the popup is dismissed
        print('Popup dismissed');
      },
    ).show();
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, an info pop-up appears with a title and content. You can customize the title, content, and actions as needed.

# Complete Example of Using info_popup

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:info_popup/info_popup.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Info Popup Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Show the info popup when the button is pressed
              showInfoPopup(context);
            },
            child: Text('Show Info Popup'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void showInfoPopup(BuildContext context) {
    // Create and show the info popup
    InfoPopup(
      title: 'Information',
      content: 'This is an example of an info popup.',
      context: context,
      onDismiss: () {
        // Action to perform when the popup is dismissed
        print('Popup dismissed');
      },
    ).show();
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which builds the main UI.
// 2. A button is displayed in the center of the screen.
// 3. When the button is pressed, the showInfoPopup method is called.
// 4. The showInfoPopup method creates an InfoPopup instance with a title and content.
// 5. The popup is displayed, and the user can dismiss it.
// 6. Upon dismissal, a message is printed to the console.
