# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using dropdownfield2

## Installation
To use the `dropdownfield2` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  dropdownfield2: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your dropdown interacts with any device features. However, for basic usage, no specific configurations are needed.

## Basic Usage
To use the `dropdownfield2` package, you can create a simple dropdown field in your Flutter widget. Below is a basic example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dropdownfield2/dropdownfield2.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('DropdownField2 Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: DropdownField(
            items: ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3'],
            onChanged: (value) {
              // Handle the selected value
              print('Selected: $value');
            },
            decoration: InputDecoration(
              labelText: 'Select an option',
              border: OutlineInputBorder(),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple dropdown field with three options. The `onChanged` callback is triggered when the user selects an option.

# Complete Example of dropdownfield2

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dropdownfield2/dropdownfield2.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('DropdownField2 Example')),
        body: MyDropdownWidget(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MyDropdownWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyDropdownWidgetState createState() => _MyDropdownWidgetState();
}

class _MyDropdownWidgetState extends State<MyDropdownWidget> {
  // List of options for the dropdown
  final List<String> _options = ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3', 'Option 4'];
  // Variable to hold the selected value
  String? _selectedValue;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
      child: DropdownField(
        items: _options,
        onChanged: (value) {
          // Update the selected value when the user selects an option
          setState(() {
            _selectedValue = value;
          });
          // Print the selected value to the console
          print('Selected: $value');
        },
        decoration: InputDecoration(
          labelText: 'Select an option',
          border: OutlineInputBorder(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which sets up the MaterialApp and Scaffold.
// 2. Inside the Scaffold, we have an AppBar and a body that contains the MyDropdownWidget.
// 3. MyDropdownWidget is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the selected dropdown value.
// 4. The dropdown is created using the DropdownField widget, which takes a list of options and an onChanged callback.
// 5. When the user selects an option, the onChanged callback is triggered, updating the state and printing the selected value to the console.
// 6. The dropdown is styled using the InputDecoration to provide a label and border.
