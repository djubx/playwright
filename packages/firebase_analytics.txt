# Tutorial: Setting Up Firebase Analytics in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `firebase_analytics` package in a Flutter application. 

## Step 1: Add Dependencies

First, add the `firebase_analytics` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  firebase_core: ^2.0.0
  firebase_analytics: ^10.0.0
```

## Step 2: Initialize Firebase

Before using Firebase Analytics, you need to initialize Firebase in your app. This is done in the `main.dart` file.

### Android Configuration

1. Add the `google-services.json` file to your `android/app` directory.
2. Update your `android/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
buildscript {
    dependencies {
        // Add this line
        classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.10'
    }
}
```

3. Update your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services' // Add this line

android {
    ...
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Add the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file to your `ios/Runner` directory.
2. Open your `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift` file and add the following import:

```swift
import Firebase
```

3. Initialize Firebase in the `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method:

```swift
FirebaseApp.configure()
```

## Step 3: Using Firebase Analytics

Now that Firebase is set up, you can start using Firebase Analytics in your app. Hereâ€™s how to log an event:

```dart
import 'package:firebase_analytics/firebase_analytics.dart';

class RealFlutter {
  static final FirebaseAnalytics analytics = FirebaseAnalytics.instance;

  Future<void> logEvent(String eventName) async {
    await analytics.logEvent(
      name: eventName,
      parameters: <String, dynamic>{
        'string': 'string',
        'int': 42,
      },
    );
  }
}
```

You can call `logEvent` whenever you want to track a specific action in your app.

# Complete Example: Firebase Analytics in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';
import 'package:firebase_analytics/firebase_analytics.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized(); // Ensures Flutter is initialized
  await Firebase.initializeApp(); // Initializes Firebase
  runApp(MyApp()); // Runs the app
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Firebase Analytics Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(), // Sets the home screen
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  // Create an instance of FirebaseAnalytics
  static final FirebaseAnalytics analytics = FirebaseAnalytics.instance;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Firebase Analytics Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            logButtonPress(); // Logs button press event
          },
          child: Text('Press Me'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to log button press event
  Future<void> logButtonPress() async {
    await analytics.logEvent(
      name: 'button_press', // Event name
      parameters: <String, dynamic>{
        'button_name': 'press_me', // Parameter for the event
      },
    );
    print('Button Pressed!'); // Debug message
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, initializing Firebase.
// 2. MyApp is the root widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. HomeScreen is displayed as the main interface.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the logButtonPress function is called.
// 5. This function logs the 'button_press' event to Firebase Analytics with a parameter.
// 6. A debug message is printed to the console for confirmation.
```
