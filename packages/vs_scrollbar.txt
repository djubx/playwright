# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using vs_scrollbar

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `vs_scrollbar` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  vs_scrollbar: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the `vs_scrollbar` package:

```dart
import 'package:vs_scrollbar/vs_scrollbar.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using vs_scrollbar in Your Application

### Basic Usage

Wrap your scrollable widget (like `ListView`, `SingleChildScrollView`, etc.) with the `VsScrollbar` widget. Here’s a simple example:

```dart
VsScrollbar(
  child: ListView.builder(
    itemCount: 100,
    itemBuilder: (context, index) {
      return ListTile(
        title: Text('Item $index'),
      );
    },
  ),
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

#### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Customizing the Scrollbar

You can customize the scrollbar by providing various parameters such as `thumbColor`, `trackColor`, and `thickness`. Here’s an example:

```dart
VsScrollbar(
  thumbColor: Colors.blue,
  trackColor: Colors.grey[300],
  thickness: 8.0,
  child: ListView.builder(
    itemCount: 100,
    itemBuilder: (context, index) {
      return ListTile(
        title: Text('Item $index'),
      );
    },
  ),
)
```

### Optimizations

- **Performance**: Use `ListView.builder` for large lists to improve performance.
- **Visibility**: Adjust the scrollbar's visibility settings to enhance user experience.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate and customize the `vs_scrollbar` package in your Flutter application effectively.

# Complete Example of vs_scrollbar in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:vs_scrollbar/vs_scrollbar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'vs_scrollbar Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('vs_scrollbar Example'),
        ),
        body: VsScrollbar(
          // Customizing the scrollbar
          thumbColor: Colors.blue, // Color of the scrollbar thumb
          trackColor: Colors.grey[300], // Color of the scrollbar track
          thickness: 8.0, // Thickness of the scrollbar
          child: ListView.builder(
            itemCount: 100, // Number of items in the list
            itemBuilder: (context, index) {
              return ListTile(
                title: Text('Item $index'), // Displaying item index
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'vs_scrollbar Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold wraps a ListView.builder with a VsScrollbar.
// 5. The VsScrollbar is customized with a blue thumb color, a light grey track color, and a thickness of 8.0.
// 6. The ListView.builder creates 100 list items, each displaying its index.
// 7. As the user scrolls through the list, the scrollbar provides a visual indication of their position within the scrollable area.
```
