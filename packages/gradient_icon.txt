# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Gradient Icon Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `gradient_icon` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  gradient_icon: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Open the `Podfile` and uncomment the platform line, setting it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Gradient Icon

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a gradient icon:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gradient_icon/gradient_icon.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Gradient Icon Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: GradientIcon(
            Icons.favorite,
            gradient: LinearGradient(
              colors: [Colors.red, Colors.pink],
            ),
            size: 100.0,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays a gradient icon in the center of the screen. The `GradientIcon` widget takes an icon, a gradient, and a size as parameters.

With these steps, you should be able to successfully integrate and use the `gradient_icon` package in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Gradient Icon in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gradient_icon/gradient_icon.dart';

// Main class of the Flutter application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      // Setting the title of the application
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Gradient Icon Example'), // Title displayed in the app bar
        ),
        body: Center(
          // Centering the gradient icon in the body of the application
          child: GradientIcon(
            Icons.favorite, // The icon to be displayed
            gradient: LinearGradient(
              colors: [Colors.red, Colors.pink], // Defining the gradient colors
            ),
            size: 100.0, // Size of the icon
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the RealFlutter application
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp, which provides the structure for the app.
3. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold widget is created, which contains an AppBar and a body.
4. The AppBar displays the title "Gradient Icon Example".
5. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget, which centers its child widget.
6. The child of the Center widget is a GradientIcon, which displays a heart icon with a gradient from red to pink.
7. The size of the icon is set to 100.0, making it visually prominent in the center of the screen.
