# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the action_sheet Package

## Installation
To use the `action_sheet` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  action_sheet: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. The package will work out of the box.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your app's deployment target is set to at least iOS 10. You can set this in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package
To use the `action_sheet` package, you can create an action sheet by calling the appropriate methods provided by the package. Below is a simple example of how to implement an action sheet in your Flutter app.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:action_sheet/action_sheet.dart';
```

2. Create a function to show the action sheet:

```dart
void _showActionSheet(BuildContext context) {
  showActionSheet(
    context: context,
    title: 'Choose an Option',
    options: [
      ActionSheetOption(
        title: 'Option 1',
        onPressed: () {
          // Handle Option 1
          Navigator.pop(context);
        },
      ),
      ActionSheetOption(
        title: 'Option 2',
        onPressed: () {
          // Handle Option 2
          Navigator.pop(context);
        },
      ),
      ActionSheetOption(
        title: 'Cancel',
        isCancel: true,
        onPressed: () {
          Navigator.pop(context);
        },
      ),
    ],
  );
}
```

3. Call this function from a button or any other widget in your UI.

This setup will allow you to present an action sheet to the user with multiple options.

# Complete Example of Using action_sheet

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:action_sheet/action_sheet.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Action Sheet Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Action Sheet Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Call the function to show the action sheet when the button is pressed
              _showActionSheet(context);
            },
            child: Text('Show Action Sheet'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void _showActionSheet(BuildContext context) {
    // Display the action sheet with options
    showActionSheet(
      context: context,
      title: 'Choose an Option',
      options: [
        ActionSheetOption(
          title: 'Option 1',
          onPressed: () {
            // Handle Option 1
            Navigator.pop(context); // Close the action sheet
          },
        ),
        ActionSheetOption(
          title: 'Option 2',
          onPressed: () {
            // Handle Option 2
            Navigator.pop(context); // Close the action sheet
          },
        ),
        ActionSheetOption(
          title: 'Cancel',
          isCancel: true, // Mark this option as a cancel action
          onPressed: () {
            Navigator.pop(context); // Close the action sheet
          },
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'Action Sheet Demo'.
// 4. The body contains a Center widget with an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the _showActionSheet function is called.
// 6. The _showActionSheet function displays the action sheet with three options: Option 1, Option 2, and Cancel.
// 7. Each option has an onPressed callback that handles the action and closes the action sheet when selected.
```
