# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `flutter_animarker`

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_animarker` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_animarker: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Configure Google Maps

### For Android
1. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions and your Google Maps API key:

```xml
<manifest>
    <application>
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
            android:value="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"/>
    </application>
</manifest>
```

### For iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key for location services:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show it on the map.</string>
```

3. Also, ensure you have your Google Maps API key set up in your project.

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement animated markers.

# Complete Example of Using `flutter_animarker`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:google_maps_flutter/google_maps_flutter.dart';
import 'package:flutter_animarker/flutter_animarker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Animarker Example',
      home: MapScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class MapScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MapScreenState createState() => _MapScreenState();
}

class _MapScreenState extends State<MapScreen> {
  late GoogleMapController mapController; // Controller for Google Map
  final LatLng _initialPosition = LatLng(37.7749, -122.4194); // Initial position (San Francisco)
  late Animarker _animarker; // Animarker instance
  late Marker _marker; // Marker instance

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _marker = Marker(
      markerId: MarkerId('animated_marker'),
      position: _initialPosition,
      infoWindow: InfoWindow(title: 'Moving Marker'),
    );
    _animarker = Animarker(
      mapController: mapController,
      markers: [_marker],
    );
  }

  void _onMapCreated(GoogleMapController controller) {
    mapController = controller; // Initialize the map controller
    _animarker.init(); // Initialize the animarker
    _startMarkerAnimation(); // Start the marker animation
  }

  void _startMarkerAnimation() {
    // Define the path for the marker to follow
    List<LatLng> path = [
      LatLng(37.7749, -122.4194),
      LatLng(37.7849, -122.4294),
      LatLng(37.7949, -122.4394),
    ];
    _animarker.animateMarker(path, duration: Duration(seconds: 5)); // Animate the marker along the path
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Animarker Example')),
      body: GoogleMap(
        onMapCreated: _onMapCreated,
        initialCameraPosition: CameraPosition(
          target: _initialPosition,
          zoom: 14.0,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (MapScreen).
// 3. In the MapScreen, we initialize the Google Map and the Animarker.
// 4. The _onMapCreated method is called when the map is ready, initializing the animarker and starting the animation.
// 5. The _startMarkerAnimation method defines a path for the marker to follow and starts the animation.
// 6. The Google Map displays the animated marker moving along the defined path.
```
