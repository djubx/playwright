# Phased Flutter Package: A Comprehensive Overview

The **phased** Flutter package is designed to facilitate the implementation of phased animations in Flutter applications. Phased animations allow developers to create smooth transitions and effects that enhance the user experience by guiding users through different states of an application. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to animate multiple elements in a sequence or staggered manner, such as onboarding screens, form submissions, or any UI that requires a step-by-step reveal.

## Key Features
- **Sequential Animations**: Easily create animations that occur one after another.
- **Customizable Durations**: Control the timing of each phase to create the desired effect.
- **Ease of Use**: Simple API that integrates seamlessly with Flutter's existing animation framework.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Options to customize the animation curve, duration, and delay for each phase.

## When to Use
- When you want to create engaging onboarding experiences.
- For forms where you want to reveal fields progressively.
- In any UI where a step-by-step animation can enhance user interaction.

Overall, the **phased** package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to add sophisticated animations to their applications with minimal effort.

# Setting Up and Using the Phased Package

## Installation
To use the **phased** package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  phased: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, make sure your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the **phased** package, you will typically create a `PhasedAnimation` widget and define the phases of your animation. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:phased/phased.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Phased Animation Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: PhasedAnimation(
          phases: [
            Phase(
              duration: Duration(milliseconds: 500),
              child: Text('Phase 1'),
            ),
            Phase(
              duration: Duration(milliseconds: 500),
              child: Text('Phase 2'),
            ),
            Phase(
              duration: Duration(milliseconds: 500),
              child: Text('Phase 3'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates a simple phased animation where three text widgets appear one after the other. You can customize the duration and add more phases as needed.

# Complete Example of Phased Package in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:phased/phased.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Phased Animation Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Phased Animation Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: PhasedAnimation(
          phases: [
            // Phase 1: Text appears with a duration of 500 milliseconds
            Phase(
              duration: Duration(milliseconds: 500),
              child: Text(
                'Welcome to the App!',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
              ),
            ),
            // Phase 2: Text appears with a duration of 500 milliseconds
            Phase(
              duration: Duration(milliseconds: 500),
              child: Text(
                'Let\'s get started.',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
              ),
            ),
            // Phase 3: Text appears with a duration of 500 milliseconds
            Phase(
              duration: Duration(milliseconds: 500),
              child: Text(
                'Enjoy your experience!',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a PhasedAnimation widget is created with three phases.
// 5. Each phase contains a Text widget that appears sequentially, with a duration of 500 milliseconds for each.
// 6. As the app runs, users will see the welcome message, followed by the next two messages, creating a smooth phased animation effect.
