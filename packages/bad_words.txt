# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Bad Words Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **bad_words** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  bad_words: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Here’s how to implement it:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:bad_words/bad_words.dart';
```

2. Create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class (or any class you choose) and use the package to filter text.

### Example Usage

```dart
void main() {
  final badWords = BadWords();
  String inputText = "This is a bad example of a text with bad words.";
  
  // Check for bad words
  bool containsBadWords = badWords.hasBadWords(inputText);
  
  if (containsBadWords) {
    print("The text contains inappropriate language.");
  } else {
    print("The text is clean.");
  }
}
```

This simple setup allows you to check any string for bad words and take appropriate action based on the result.

# Complete Example of Using the Bad Words Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bad_words/bad_words.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Bad Words Filter Example',
      home: BadWordsHome(),
    );
  }
}

class BadWordsHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _BadWordsHomeState createState() => _BadWordsHomeState();
}

class _BadWordsHomeState extends State<BadWordsHome> {
  final BadWords _badWords = BadWords(); // Create an instance of BadWords
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController(); // Controller for text input
  String _resultMessage = ""; // Message to display the result

  // Function to check for bad words
  void _checkForBadWords() {
    String inputText = _controller.text; // Get the input text
    // Check if the input text contains bad words
    if (_badWords.hasBadWords(inputText)) {
      setState(() {
        _resultMessage = "The text contains inappropriate language."; // Update the result message
      });
    } else {
      setState(() {
        _resultMessage = "The text is clean."; // Update the result message
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Bad Words Filter'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              controller: _controller, // Assign the controller to the TextField
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Enter text',
                border: OutlineInputBorder(),
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _checkForBadWords, // Call the function on button press
              child: Text('Check for Bad Words'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(
              _resultMessage, // Display the result message
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16, color: Colors.red),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget (BadWordsHome).
// 3. BadWordsHome is a stateful widget that maintains the state of the input text and result message.
// 4. The user enters text into a TextField, which is controlled by a TextEditingController.
// 5. When the user presses the "Check for Bad Words" button, the _checkForBadWords function is called.
// 6. This function checks the input text for bad words using the BadWords package.
// 7. Based on the result, the _resultMessage is updated and displayed to the user.
```
