# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_sharing_intent

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_sharing_intent` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_sharing_intent` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_sharing_intent: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following entries to allow sharing:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to share images.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save images.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone to share audio.</string>
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_sharing_intent/flutter_sharing_intent.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the package to share content. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to share text:

```dart
void shareText(String text) {
  FlutterSharingIntent.share(text: text);
}
```

You can also share images and files similarly by using the appropriate methods provided by the package.

# Complete Example of flutter_sharing_intent

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_sharing_intent/flutter_sharing_intent.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Sharing Intent Example',
      home: SharingHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class SharingHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SharingHomePageState createState() => _SharingHomePageState();
}

class _SharingHomePageState extends State<SharingHomePage> {
  // This method is called when the user taps the share button
  void _shareContent() {
    // Sharing a simple text message
    FlutterSharingIntent.share(text: "Hello from RealFlutter!");
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Share Intent Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _shareContent, // Trigger the share action
          child: Text('Share Text'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home page.
// 3. SharingHomePage is a StatefulWidget that contains the UI for sharing content.
// 4. When the user taps the "Share Text" button, the _shareContent method is called.
// 5. The _shareContent method uses FlutterSharingIntent to share a text message.
// 6. The app displays a button that, when pressed, shares the specified text with other applications.
