# Fuzzy Flutter Package: An Overview

The `fuzzy` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to enhance search functionalities within your Flutter applications. It implements fuzzy search algorithms, which are particularly useful when you need to find strings that match a pattern approximately rather than exactly. This is especially beneficial in applications where user input might be prone to errors or variations, such as typos or different spellings.

## When to Use the Fuzzy Package

- **Search Bars**: Enhance search bars in your app to handle user input errors gracefully.
- **Autocomplete Features**: Improve the accuracy of autocomplete suggestions by allowing for slight mismatches.
- **Data Filtering**: Filter large datasets efficiently by matching user queries with potential results that are not exact matches.

## Key Features

- **High Performance**: Optimized for speed and efficiency, making it suitable for large datasets.
- **Customizable**: Offers various configuration options to tailor the search behavior to your needs.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

# Setting Up and Using the Fuzzy Package

In this section, we'll walk through the setup process for the `fuzzy` package and demonstrate how to integrate it into your Flutter project.

## Installation

To get started, add the `fuzzy` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  fuzzy: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Setup

The `fuzzy` package is primarily a Dart-based package, so it doesn't require any additional platform-specific setup for Android or iOS. However, ensure your Flutter environment is correctly set up for both platforms to avoid any runtime issues.

## Basic Usage

To use the `fuzzy` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:fuzzy/fuzzy.dart';
```

### Creating a Fuzzy Search Instance

You can create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class (our main class for this example) to perform fuzzy searches:

```dart
final fuzzy = RealFlutter([
  'apple',
  'banana',
  'grape',
  'orange',
  'pineapple',
]);

final results = fuzzy.search('aple');
```

### Configuration Options

The `RealFlutter` class provides several configuration options to customize the search behavior:

- **Threshold**: Adjusts the sensitivity of the search.
- **Location**: Determines how close the match must be to the beginning of the text.
- **Distance**: Specifies the maximum distance between the search term and the result.

# Complete Example: Fuzzy Search in Flutter

Below is a complete example of a Flutter application using the `fuzzy` package. This example demonstrates how to set up a simple search interface that utilizes fuzzy search to handle user input errors.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fuzzy/fuzzy.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Fuzzy Search Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: SearchPage(),
    );
  }
}

class SearchPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SearchPageState createState() => _SearchPageState();
}

class _SearchPageState extends State<SearchPage> {
  final List<String> items = [
    'apple',
    'banana',
    'grape',
    'orange',
    'pineapple',
  ];
  List<String> results = [];
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Fuzzy Search Example'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              controller: _controller,
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Search',
                border: OutlineInputBorder(),
              ),
              onChanged: _search,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Expanded(
              child: ListView.builder(
                itemCount: results.length,
                itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                  return ListTile(
                    title: Text(results[index]),
                  );
                },
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void _search(String query) {
    // Create a Fuzzy instance with the list of items
    final fuzzy = RealFlutter(items);

    // Perform the search with the user's query
    final result = fuzzy.search(query);

    // Update the results state with the search results
    setState(() {
      results = result.map((r) => r.item).toList();
    });
  }
}
```

// The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `MyApp` widget.
// `MyApp` is a stateless widget that sets up the MaterialApp and specifies `SearchPage` as the home screen.
// `SearchPage` is a stateful widget that manages the search functionality.
// The `_SearchPageState` class contains a list of items to search through and a list to store search results.
// A `TextEditingController` is used to capture user input from a `TextField`.
// The `_search` method is called whenever the text in the `TextField` changes.
// This method creates a `RealFlutter` instance with the list of items and performs a search with the user's query.
// The search results are then updated in the state, triggering a rebuild of the UI to display the results in a `ListView`.
