1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:polar_tab_bar/polar_tab_bar.dart';
```

2. Create a StatefulWidget to manage the state of the tab bar.

3. Use the `PolarTabBar` widget in your build method.

This will be demonstrated in the complete example section below.

# Complete Example of Using polar_tab_bar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:polar_tab_bar/polar_tab_bar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to keep track of the selected tab index
  int _selectedIndex = 0;

  // List of widgets to display for each tab
  final List<Widget> _widgetOptions = <Widget>[
    Center(child: Text('Home')),
    Center(child: Text('Search')),
    Center(child: Text('Profile')),
  ];

  // Method to handle tab selection
  void _onItemTapped(int index) {
    setState(() {
      _selectedIndex = index; // Update the selected index
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Polar Tab Bar Example'),
        ),
        body: _widgetOptions.elementAt(_selectedIndex), // Display the selected tab's widget
        bottomNavigationBar: PolarTabBar(
          currentIndex: _selectedIndex, // Set the current index
          onTap: _onItemTapped, // Handle tab selection
          items: [
            PolarTabItem(icon: Icons.home, label: 'Home'), // First tab
            PolarTabItem(icon: Icons.search, label: 'Search'), // Second tab
            PolarTabItem(icon: Icons.person, label: 'Profile'), // Third tab
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code creates a simple Flutter application with a polar tab bar.
// 1. The `main` function initializes the app by running the `RealFlutter` widget.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` class is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the selected tab.
// 3. The `_selectedIndex` variable keeps track of which tab is currently selected.
// 4. The `_widgetOptions` list contains the widgets to display for each tab.
// 5. The `_onItemTapped` method updates the `_selectedIndex` when a tab is tapped.
// 6. The `build` method constructs the UI, including an AppBar and the PolarTabBar.
// 7. The `PolarTabBar` widget is configured with the current index, a callback for tab selection, and a list of tab items.
// 8. The body of the Scaffold displays the widget corresponding to the selected tab.
