# Overview of the password_protected_pdf_checker Flutter Package

The `password_protected_pdf_checker` package is a specialized Flutter library designed to help developers determine whether a PDF file is password-protected. This package is particularly useful in applications that require document management, such as file viewers, document editors, or any app that handles PDF files. By integrating this package, developers can enhance user experience by providing feedback on the accessibility of PDF documents before attempting to open or manipulate them.

## Key Features
- **Password Protection Detection**: Quickly checks if a PDF file is password-protected.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Simple API**: Easy-to-use methods for checking PDF files without complex configurations.

## When to Use
- When building a PDF viewer that needs to handle both protected and unprotected files.
- In document management systems where users upload PDFs, and you need to inform them about access restrictions.
- For applications that require validation of PDF files before processing them further.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using password_protected_pdf_checker

## Installation
To get started with the `password_protected_pdf_checker` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  password_protected_pdf_checker: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/password_protected_pdf_checker).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you are accessing files from the device storage. Add the following key:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to select PDF files.</string>
```

## Usage
Once the package is installed and configured, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to check if a PDF file is password-protected.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:password_protected_pdf_checker/password_protected_pdf_checker.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('PDF Checker')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Specify the path to your PDF file
              String pdfPath = 'path/to/your/file.pdf';
              
              // Check if the PDF is password protected
              bool isProtected = await PasswordProtectedPdfChecker.isProtected(pdfPath);
              
              // Show the result
              if (isProtected) {
                print('The PDF is password protected.');
              } else {
                print('The PDF is not password protected.');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Check PDF'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app with a button that checks if a specified PDF file is password-protected when pressed.

# Complete Example of Using password_protected_pdf_checker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:password_protected_pdf_checker/password_protected_pdf_checker.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('PDF Checker')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Specify the path to your PDF file
              String pdfPath = 'path/to/your/file.pdf';
              
              // Check if the PDF is password protected
              bool isProtected = await PasswordProtectedPdfChecker.isProtected(pdfPath);
              
              // Show the result
              if (isProtected) {
                print('The PDF is password protected.');
              } else {
                print('The PDF is not password protected.');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Check PDF'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which builds a MaterialApp.
// 2. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. The Center widget contains an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, it triggers an asynchronous function.
// 5. The function specifies the path to the PDF file to be checked.
// 6. It then calls the isProtected method from the password_protected_pdf_checker package.
// 7. Based on the result, it prints whether the PDF is password protected or not to the console.
