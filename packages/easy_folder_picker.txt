# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Easy Folder Picker

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **easy_folder_picker** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  easy_folder_picker: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/easy_folder_picker).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

2. If your app targets Android 10 (API level 29) or higher, you may need to add the following attribute to your `AndroidManifest.xml` to allow access to external storage:

```xml
<application
    android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="true"
    ... >
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following key to request permission to access the user's files:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to select folders.</string>
<key>NSDocumentsFolderUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your documents folder to select folders.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the folder picker.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:easy_folder_picker/easy_folder_picker.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Easy Folder Picker Example',
      home: FolderPickerExample(),
    );
  }
}

class FolderPickerExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _FolderPickerExampleState createState() => _FolderPickerExampleState();
}

class _FolderPickerExampleState extends State<FolderPickerExample> {
  String? _selectedFolder;

  void _pickFolder() async {
    // Open the folder picker dialog
    String? folderPath = await EasyFolderPicker.pickFolder();
    if (folderPath != null) {
      setState(() {
        _selectedFolder = folderPath; // Update the selected folder path
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Folder Picker Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text(
              _selectedFolder != null
                  ? 'Selected Folder: $_selectedFolder'
                  : 'No folder selected',
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _pickFolder,
              child: Text('Pick a Folder'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Easy Folder Picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:easy_folder_picker/easy_folder_picker.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Easy Folder Picker Example',
      home: FolderPickerExample(),
    );
  }
}

class FolderPickerExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _FolderPickerExampleState createState() => _FolderPickerExampleState();
}

class _FolderPickerExampleState extends State<FolderPickerExample> {
  String? _selectedFolder; // Variable to hold the selected folder path

  void _pickFolder() async {
    // Open the folder picker dialog
    String? folderPath = await EasyFolderPicker.pickFolder();
    if (folderPath != null) {
      setState(() {
        _selectedFolder = folderPath; // Update the selected folder path
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Folder Picker Example'), // Title of the app
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text(
              _selectedFolder != null
                  ? 'Selected Folder: $_selectedFolder' // Display selected folder
                  : 'No folder selected', // Message when no folder is selected
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between text and button
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _pickFolder, // Call _pickFolder when button is pressed
              child: Text('Pick a Folder'), // Button text
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The home of the app is set to FolderPickerExample, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 3. Inside FolderPickerExample, we have a state class _FolderPickerExampleState.
// 4. A variable _selectedFolder is declared to hold the path of the selected folder.
// 5. The _pickFolder method is defined to open the folder picker dialog.
// 6. When a folder is selected, the state is updated to reflect the selected folder path.
// 7. The build method constructs the UI, displaying the selected folder or a message if none is selected.
// 8. An ElevatedButton is provided to trigger the folder picking process when pressed.
