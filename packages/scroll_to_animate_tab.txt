# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `scroll_to_animate_tab`

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `scroll_to_animate_tab` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `scroll_to_animate_tab` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  scroll_to_animate_tab: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Open the `Podfile` and uncomment the platform line, setting it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's implement it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to use the `scroll_to_animate_tab` package to create animated tab transitions.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:scroll_to_animate_tab/scroll_to_animate_tab.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Scroll to Animate Tab Example',
      home: AnimatedTabExample(),
    );
  }
}

class AnimatedTabExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _AnimatedTabExampleState createState() => _AnimatedTabExampleState();
}

class _AnimatedTabExampleState extends State<AnimatedTabExample> with SingleTickerProviderStateMixin {
  late TabController _tabController;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the TabController with 3 tabs
    _tabController = TabController(length: 3, vsync: this);
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose the TabController when the widget is removed from the widget tree
    _tabController.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Animated Tabs Example'),
        bottom: TabBar(
          controller: _tabController,
          tabs: [
            Tab(text: 'Tab 1'),
            Tab(text: 'Tab 2'),
            Tab(text: 'Tab 3'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
      body: TabBarView(
        controller: _tabController,
        children: [
          // Each tab displays a different text
          Center(child: Text('Content for Tab 1')),
          Center(child: Text('Content for Tab 2')),
          Center(child: Text('Content for Tab 3')),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and home set to AnimatedTabExample.
// 3. AnimatedTabExample is a StatefulWidget that creates a TabController for managing tabs.
// 4. The TabController is initialized with 3 tabs in the initState method.
// 5. The AppBar contains a TabBar with three tabs, each labeled accordingly.
// 6. The body of the Scaffold contains a TabBarView that displays different content for each tab.
// 7. When a tab is selected, the TabBarView animates the transition to the corresponding content.
