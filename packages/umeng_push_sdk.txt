// This is the main entry point of the app.
// We initialize the Umeng Push SDK with our app key and message secret.
// We then run the app.

// In the `_MyAppState` class, we add a push message listener in the `initState` method.
// This listener will be called whenever a push message is received.

// In the `build` method, we create a simple UI with a button.
// When the button is pressed, we send a push message using the `sendPushMessage` method.

// The push message will be received by the app and displayed in the console.

// This is a basic example of how to use the Umeng Push SDK in a Flutter app.
// You can customize the SDK to fit your needs and add more features as needed.
