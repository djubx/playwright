# Croupier Flutter Package: A High-Level Overview

The **Croupier** package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who want to implement a robust and flexible state management solution. It is particularly useful in applications that require complex state management, such as games, financial applications, or any app with dynamic data that changes frequently.

## When to Use Croupier
- **Game Development**: Ideal for managing game states, player data, and game logic.
- **Financial Applications**: Useful for tracking transactions, user balances, and real-time updates.
- **Dynamic User Interfaces**: Perfect for apps that require frequent updates based on user interactions or external data sources.

## Key Features
- **Reactive State Management**: Automatically updates the UI when the underlying state changes.
- **Scoped State**: Allows for state management at different levels of the widget tree, providing flexibility and performance.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate with existing Flutter applications without significant refactoring.
- **Testability**: Designed with testability in mind, making it easier to write unit tests for your application logic.

Overall, Croupier provides a structured approach to managing state in Flutter applications, making it a valuable addition to any developer's toolkit.

# Croupier Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the Croupier package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  croupier: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/croupier).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter and Croupier:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use Croupier in your Flutter application, you will typically follow these steps:

1. **Create a State Class**: Define a class that extends `CroupierState` to manage your application's state.
2. **Initialize Croupier**: Use the `CroupierProvider` to wrap your application or specific widgets that need access to the state.
3. **Update State**: Use methods provided by Croupier to update the state and notify listeners.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set up Croupier in your Flutter app:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:croupier/croupier.dart';

class MyAppState extends CroupierState {
  int counter = 0;

  void increment() {
    counter++;
    notifyListeners(); // Notify listeners about the state change
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(CroupierProvider<MyAppState>(
    create: () => MyAppState(),
    child: MyApp(),
  ));
}
```

In this example, we create a simple state class that manages a counter. The `increment` method updates the counter and notifies any listeners about the change.

# Complete Example of Croupier in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:croupier/croupier.dart';

// Define the state class that extends CroupierState
class MyAppState extends CroupierState {
  int counter = 0; // State variable to hold the counter value

  // Method to increment the counter
  void increment() {
    counter++; // Increment the counter
    notifyListeners(); // Notify listeners about the state change
  }
}

// Main function to run the app
void main() {
  runApp(CroupierProvider<MyAppState>(
    create: () => MyAppState(), // Create an instance of MyAppState
    child: MyApp(), // Pass the MyApp widget as the child
  ));
}

// Define the main application widget
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Croupier Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Croupier State Management'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Use CroupierConsumer to listen to state changes
              CroupierConsumer<MyAppState>(
                builder: (context, state) {
                  return Text(
                    'Counter: ${state.counter}', // Display the current counter value
                    style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
                  );
                },
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Call the increment method when the button is pressed
                  context.read<MyAppState>().increment();
                },
                child: Text('Increment Counter'), // Button to increment the counter
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts by running the main function, which initializes the CroupierProvider with MyAppState.
// 2. MyAppState is created, which holds the counter state.
// 3. The MyApp widget is built, which contains a MaterialApp and a Scaffold.
// 4. Inside the Scaffold, a CroupierConsumer listens for changes in MyAppState.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the increment method is called, updating the counter and notifying listeners.
// 6. The UI automatically rebuilds to reflect the updated counter value.
```
