# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Better Page Turn

## Installation
To get started with the better_page_turn package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  better_page_turn: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No specific configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package
To use the better_page_turn package, you will typically create a `PageTurn` widget that wraps your content. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:better_page_turn/better_page_turn.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: PageTurn(
        child: Center(child: Text("Page 1")),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `PageTurn` widget wraps a simple text widget. You can replace the `Center(child: Text("Page 1"))` with any widget you want to display.

### Customization
You can customize the page turn effect by adjusting properties such as `duration` and `curve`. For example:

```dart
PageTurn(
  duration: Duration(milliseconds: 600),
  curve: Curves.easeInOut,
  child: Center(child: Text("Page 1")),
)
```

This will change the duration of the animation and the curve used for the transition.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the better_page_turn package into your Flutter application easily.

# Complete Example of Better Page Turn

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:better_page_turn/better_page_turn.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // List of pages to display
  final List<String> pages = ["Page 1", "Page 2", "Page 3"];
  int currentPage = 0; // Track the current page index

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Better Page Turn Example")),
        body: PageTurn(
          // Wrap the current page content in PageTurn
          child: Center(
            child: Text(
              pages[currentPage], // Display the current page text
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
          ),
          onPageTurned: (int newPage) {
            // Update the current page index when the page is turned
            setState(() {
              currentPage = newPage;
            });
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
// The main function initializes the app and runs the RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget is a StatefulWidget that maintains the current page index.
// The build method creates a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a PageTurn widget.
// The PageTurn widget wraps a Center widget that displays the current page text.
// The onPageTurned callback updates the current page index when a page turn occurs.
// This allows users to navigate through the pages smoothly, creating an engaging reading experience.
```
