# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Scaffold Gradient Background Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `scaffold_gradient_background` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  scaffold_gradient_background: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the gradient background, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:scaffold_gradient_background/scaffold_gradient_background.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

You can now use the `ScaffoldGradientBackground` widget in your app. Here’s how to set it up:

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Example Usage

Here’s a simple example of how to use the `ScaffoldGradientBackground` widget in your Flutter app:

```dart
ScaffoldGradientBackground(
  gradient: LinearGradient(
    colors: [Colors.blue, Colors.purple],
    begin: Alignment.topLeft,
    end: Alignment.bottomRight,
  ),
  child: Center(
    child: Text(
      'Hello, Gradient Background!',
      style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24),
    ),
  ),
);
```

This code creates a gradient background that transitions from blue to purple, with a centered text widget.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the `scaffold_gradient_background` package in your Flutter application effectively.

# Complete Example of Using Scaffold Gradient Background

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:scaffold_gradient_background/scaffold_gradient_background.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Gradient Background Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ScaffoldGradientBackground(
      // Define the gradient colors and direction
      gradient: LinearGradient(
        colors: [Colors.blue, Colors.purple],
        begin: Alignment.topLeft,
        end: Alignment.bottomRight,
      ),
      child: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Welcome to RealFlutter!',
              style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 32),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action when button is pressed
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Button Pressed!')),
                );
              },
              child: Text('Press Me'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter uses ScaffoldGradientBackground to create a gradient background.
// 4. The gradient is defined from blue to purple, covering the entire screen.
// 5. A centered column contains a welcome text and a button.
// 6. When the button is pressed, a SnackBar appears at the bottom of the screen, indicating the button was pressed.
