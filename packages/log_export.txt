# Overview of the log_export Flutter Package

The `log_export` package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who need to manage and export logs from their applications. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to keep track of application behavior, debug issues, or analyze user interactions. By providing a straightforward API for logging, `log_export` allows developers to easily capture logs and export them in various formats.

## When to Use `log_export`
- **Debugging**: Capture logs during development to troubleshoot issues.
- **Analytics**: Track user interactions and application performance.
- **Error Reporting**: Log errors and exceptions for later analysis.
- **Compliance**: Maintain logs for regulatory requirements.

## Key Features
- **Flexible Logging Levels**: Supports various logging levels (info, warning, error).
- **Export Options**: Allows exporting logs in different formats (e.g., text, JSON).
- **Customizable**: Easily configurable to suit different logging needs.
- **Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.

With these features, `log_export` is an essential package for any Flutter application that requires robust logging capabilities.

# Setting Up and Using the log_export Package

## Installation
To get started with `log_export`, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  log_export: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file. You may need to add permissions for writing to external storage if you plan to export logs to a file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to configure your app's `Info.plist` to allow file access. Add the following key to request permission for file access:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to save logs.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
Once the package is installed and configured, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to log messages:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:log_export/log_export.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Initialize the logger
    final logger = LogExport();

    // Log an info message
    logger.logInfo("Application started");

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Log Export Example")),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Log a warning message when the button is pressed
              logger.logWarning("Button pressed!");
            },
            child: Text("Press Me"),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize the logger and log messages at different points in the application. The `logInfo` and `logWarning` methods are used to log messages with different severity levels.

# Complete Example of log_export in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:log_export/log_export.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Initialize the logger
    final logger = LogExport();

    // Log an info message indicating the application has started
    logger.logInfo("Application started");

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Log Export Example")),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Log a warning message when the button is pressed
              logger.logWarning("Button pressed!");
            },
            child: Text("Press Me"),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created and run using runApp().
// 3. Inside the RealFlutter widget, we initialize the LogExport logger.
// 4. An info log is generated when the application starts, indicating that the app has launched.
// 5. The UI consists of a simple button. When the button is pressed, a warning log is generated.
// 6. This allows developers to track user interactions and application behavior through the logs.
