```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_circle_chart/flutter_circle_chart.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Circle Chart Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  int _percentage = 75;

  void _incrementPercentage() {
    setState(() {
      _percentage += 10;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Circle Chart Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            CircleChart(
              chartType: ChartType.progress,
              percentage: _percentage,
              arcColor: Colors.blue,
              arcWidth: 20,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _incrementPercentage,
              child: Text('Increment Percentage'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a circular chart displaying a progress percentage.
// 2. The user can increment the percentage by tapping the "Increment Percentage" button.
// 3. The chart updates in real-time to reflect the new percentage.
// 4. The user can continue to increment the percentage until it reaches 100%.
// 5. The chart will display a full circle when the percentage reaches 100%.

// The code flow is as follows:
// 1. The `MyApp` widget is created and returned as the root of the app.
// 2. The `MyHomePage` widget is created and returned as the home page of the app.
// 3. The `_MyHomePageState` class is created to manage the state of the home page.
// 4. The `build` method is called to create the UI for the home page.
// 5. The `CircleChart` widget is created and added to the UI to display the circular chart.
// 6. The `ElevatedButton` widget is created and added to the UI to allow the user to increment the percentage.
// 7. The `_incrementPercentage` method is called when the user taps the button to increment the percentage.
// 8. The `setState` method is called to update the state of the home page with the new percentage.
// 9. The `build` method is called again to update the UI with the new percentage.
