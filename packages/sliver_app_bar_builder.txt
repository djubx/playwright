     platform :ios, '10.0'
     ```

4. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the package to start using it.

   ```dart
   import 'package:sliver_app_bar_builder/sliver_app_bar_builder.dart';
   ```

## Using the Package

To use the `sliver_app_bar_builder`, you can follow this basic structure:

1. **Create a SliverAppBar**: Use the `SliverAppBarBuilder` widget to create a sliver app bar that responds to scroll events.

2. **Define the Body**: Use a `CustomScrollView` to define the body of your app, which can include multiple slivers.

3. **Customize the App Bar**: You can customize the app bar's appearance, such as its background color, elevation, and more.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a sliver app bar using the `sliver_app_bar_builder` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sliver_app_bar_builder/sliver_app_bar_builder.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: CustomScrollView(
          slivers: [
            SliverAppBarBuilder(
              builder: (context, scrollOffset, maxScrollExtent) {
                return Container(
                  color: Colors.blue.withOpacity(1 - (scrollOffset / maxScrollExtent)),
                  child: Center(
                    child: Text(
                      'Sliver App Bar',
                      style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.white),
                    ),
                  ),
                );
              },
              expandedHeight: 200.0,
            ),
            SliverList(
              delegate: SliverChildBuilderDelegate(
                (BuildContext context, int index) {
                  return ListTile(
                    title: Text('Item #$index'),
                  );
                },
                childCount: 50,
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),

        body: CustomScrollView(
          slivers: [
            // SliverAppBarBuilder creates a sliver app bar that can expand and collapse
            SliverAppBarBuilder(
              builder: (context, scrollOffset, maxScrollExtent) {
                // Calculate the opacity based on the scroll offset
                return Container(
                  color: Colors.blue.withOpacity(1 - (scrollOffset / maxScrollExtent)),
                  child: Center(
                    child: Text(
                      'Sliver App Bar',
                      style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.white),
                    ),
                  ),
                );
              },
              expandedHeight: 200.0, // Height when fully expanded
            ),
            // SliverList to display a list of items
            SliverList(
              delegate: SliverChildBuilderDelegate(
                (BuildContext context, int index) {
                  return ListTile(
                    title: Text('Item #$index'), // Display item number
                  );
                },
                childCount: 50, // Total number of items
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// 3. A CustomScrollView is used to allow for sliver-based scrolling.
// 4. The SliverAppBarBuilder is used to create a dynamic app bar that changes its opacity based on the scroll position.
// 5. The expandedHeight property defines how tall the app bar is when fully expanded.
// 6. A SliverList is added to display a list of items, which allows for smooth scrolling.
// 7. Each item in the list is created using a ListTile widget, displaying the item number.
