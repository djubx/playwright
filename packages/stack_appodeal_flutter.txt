## Setup Process

To get started with the `stack_appodeal_flutter` package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  stack_appodeal_flutter: ^latest_version
```

### Step 2: Configure Android

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Add the necessary permissions and metadata in your `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<manifest>
    <application>
        <!-- Add Appodeal metadata -->
        <meta-data
            android:name="appodeal_app_key"
            android:value="YOUR_APP_KEY" />
    </application>
</manifest>
```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure your `android/build.gradle` file includes the required repositories:

```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url 'https://maven.appodeal.com' }
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Configure iOS

1. **Update Info.plist**: Add the Appodeal key in your `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>AppodealAppKey</key>
<string>YOUR_APP_KEY</string>
```

2. **CocoaPods**: Ensure you have the necessary pods in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'

target 'Runner' do
  use_frameworks!
  pod 'Appodeal'
end
```

### Step 4: Initialize the Package

In your main Dart file, initialize the Appodeal SDK:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:stack_appodeal_flutter/stack_appodeal_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize Appodeal
    StackAppodealFlutter.initialize("YOUR_APP_KEY");
  }

  // Additional methods for showing ads will go here
}
```

### Step 5: Show Ads

You can now show ads using the methods provided by the package. For example, to show a banner ad:

```dart
StackAppodealFlutter.showBanner();
```

Make sure to handle ad events and user interactions appropriately.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:stack_appodeal_flutter/stack_appodeal_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize Appodeal with your app key
    StackAppodealFlutter.initialize("YOUR_APP_KEY");
  }

  // Method to show a banner ad
  void showBannerAd() {
    StackAppodealFlutter.showBanner();
  }

  // Method to show an interstitial ad
  void showInterstitialAd() {
    StackAppodealFlutter.showInterstitial();
  }

  // Method to show a rewarded video ad
  void showRewardedAd() {
    StackAppodealFlutter.showRewardedVideo();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('RealFlutter Appodeal Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: showBannerAd,
              child: Text('Show Banner Ad'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: showInterstitialAd,
              child: Text('Show Interstitial Ad'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: showRewardedAd,
              child: Text('Show Rewarded Ad'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds the MaterialApp and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. In RealFlutter's initState, the Appodeal SDK is initialized with the provided app key.
// 4. The build method creates a simple UI with three buttons to show different types of ads.
// 5. When a button is pressed, the corresponding method is called to display the ad.
// 6. The showBannerAd method displays a banner ad, showInterstitialAd displays an interstitial ad, and showRewardedAd displays a rewarded video ad.
```
