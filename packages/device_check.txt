# Device Check Flutter Package

The `device_check` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to help developers verify the integrity of the device on which their application is running. This package is particularly useful for applications that require a high level of security, such as those dealing with sensitive user data or financial transactions. By using this package, developers can ensure that their app is running on a legitimate device and not on an emulator or rooted device.

## When to Use

You should consider using the `device_check` package in scenarios such as:
- **Financial Applications**: To prevent fraud and ensure that transactions are made from secure devices.
- **Sensitive Data Handling**: When your app deals with personal information, ensuring the device's integrity is crucial.
- **Gaming Applications**: To prevent cheating by ensuring that the game is not running on an emulator.

## Features

- **Device Integrity Verification**: Checks if the device is rooted or running an emulator.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup and usage within your Flutter application.

By leveraging the `device_check` package, developers can enhance the security of their applications and provide a safer experience for their users.

# Tutorial: Setting Up the Device Check Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `device_check` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `device_check` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  device_check: ^0.5.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure that you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version required
    }
}
```

2. Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` includes the necessary permissions:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.device_check_example">
    <application
        ...
        android:usesCleartextTraffic="true">
        ...
    </application>
</manifest>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. Ensure that your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement device integrity checks.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:device_check/device_check.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Device Check Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Check device integrity
              bool isDeviceSecure = await DeviceCheck.isDeviceSecure;
              if (isDeviceSecure) {
                // Device is secure
                print('Device is secure.');
              } else {
                // Device is not secure
                print('Device is not secure.');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Check Device Integrity'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with a button that checks the device's integrity when pressed. The result is printed to the console.

# Complete Example: Device Check in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:device_check/device_check.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Device Check Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Check device integrity
              bool isDeviceSecure = await DeviceCheck.isDeviceSecure;
              if (isDeviceSecure) {
                // Device is secure
                print('Device is secure.');
              } else {
                // Device is not secure
                print('Device is not secure.');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Check Device Integrity'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget being built.
// 2. A MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is displayed.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the onPressed callback is triggered.
// 5. The app calls DeviceCheck.isDeviceSecure to check the device's integrity.
// 6. Based on the result, it prints whether the device is secure or not to the console.
