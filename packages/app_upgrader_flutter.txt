    iosAppId: '1234567890',
  );
}
```
### Step 4: Check for Updates

Check for updates at regular intervals or on app launch:
```dart
AppUpgraderFlutter.checkForUpdate().then((updateAvailable) {
  if (updateAvailable) {
    // Download and install the update
    AppUpgraderFlutter.downloadAndInstallUpdate();
  }
});
```
### Platform-Specific Details

* Android: Make sure to add the `androidAppId` to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file.
* iOS: Make sure to add the `iosAppId` to your `Info.plist` file.

### Configurations and Optimizations

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:app_upgrader_flutter/app_upgrader_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
  AppUpgraderFlutter.initialize(
    androidAppId: 'com.example.myapp',
    iosAppId: '1234567890',
  );
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'App Upgrader Demo',
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Check for updates on app launch
    AppUpgraderFlutter.checkForUpdate().then((updateAvailable) {
      if (updateAvailable) {
        // Download and install the update
        AppUpgraderFlutter.downloadAndInstallUpdate();
      }
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('App Upgrader Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Hello, World!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application flow:
// 1. The app is launched and the `main` function is called.
// 2. The `AppUpgraderFlutter` is initialized with the app IDs.
// 3. The `MyApp` widget is built and the `MyHomePage` widget is displayed.
// 4. The `MyHomePage` widget checks for updates on app launch.
// 5. If an update is available, it is downloaded and installed.
// 6. The app is restarted with the new version.
```

// Final summary:
// The code flows as follows: the app is launched, the upgrader is initialized, the main page is displayed, and the app checks for updates. If an update is available, it is downloaded and installed, and the app is restarted with the new version.
