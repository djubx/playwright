# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Configurable Expansion Tile

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the `configurable_expansion_tile_null_safety` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  configurable_expansion_tile_null_safety: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/configurable_expansion_tile_null_safety).

## Step 2: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:configurable_expansion_tile_null_safety/configurable_expansion_tile_null_safety.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Configurable Expansion Tile
You can now use the `ConfigurableExpansionTile` widget in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement it:

### Example Code
```dart
ConfigurableExpansionTile(
  header: Text("Header Title"),
  expandedHeader: Text("Expanded Header Title"),
  body: Column(
    children: [
      Text("This is the body content."),
      // Add more widgets here as needed
    ],
  ),
  // Additional configurations can be added here
)
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Running Your Application
After setting up the package, run your application using:

```bash
flutter run
```

This will launch your app, and you should see the expandable tiles in action.

# Complete Example of Configurable Expansion Tile

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:configurable_expansion_tile_null_safety/configurable_expansion_tile_null_safety.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Configurable Expansion Tile Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Configurable Expansion Tile Example'),
        ),
        body: ListView(
          children: [
            ConfigurableExpansionTile(
              header: Text("Header 1"),
              expandedHeader: Text("Expanded Header 1"),
              body: Column(
                children: [
                  Text("This is the body of Header 1."),
                  Text("More content can go here."),
                ],
              ),
            ),
            ConfigurableExpansionTile(
              header: Text("Header 2"),
              expandedHeader: Text("Expanded Header 2"),
              body: Column(
                children: [
                  Text("This is the body of Header 2."),
                  Text("Additional information can be added."),
                ],
              ),
            ),
            // You can add more ConfigurableExpansionTile widgets here
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Configurable Expansion Tile Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is a ListView that contains multiple ConfigurableExpansionTile widgets.
// 5. Each ConfigurableExpansionTile has a header, an expanded header, and a body with additional content.
// 6. When a user taps on a header, the corresponding body expands or collapses, allowing for a clean and organized display of information.
```
