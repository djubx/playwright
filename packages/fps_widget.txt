# fps_widget Flutter Package: A Comprehensive Guide

## <-- START_DESCRIPTION -->

### Overview of fps_widget

The `fps_widget` package is a Flutter library designed to help developers monitor and display the frames per second (FPS) of their applications. This is particularly useful for performance optimization, allowing developers to identify bottlenecks and ensure a smooth user experience. By integrating this package, you can easily visualize the rendering performance of your app in real-time.

### When to Use fps_widget

- **Performance Monitoring**: Use `fps_widget` when you want to keep track of your app's performance during development and testing.
- **Debugging**: It can help identify performance issues by providing real-time feedback on frame rendering.
- **Optimization**: If you're working on graphics-intensive applications or games, monitoring FPS can guide you in optimizing your code.

### Key Features

- **Real-time FPS Display**: Shows the current frames per second in a customizable widget.
- **Customizable Appearance**: You can easily change the look and feel of the FPS display to match your app's design.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal impact on performance, ensuring that the FPS monitoring does not interfere with the app's performance.

### Setup Process

To get started with the `fps_widget` package, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `fps_widget` dependency.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     fps_widget: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
   ```

2. **Install the Package**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: No additional configuration is required for Android.
   - **iOS**: Ensure that your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`.

### Using the Package

To use the `fps_widget`, you need to wrap your main application widget with the `FpsWidget` class. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fps_widget/fps_widget.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: FpsWidget(
        child: RealFlutter(), // Your main application widget
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Customization

You can customize the appearance of the FPS display by passing parameters to the `FpsWidget` constructor, such as `textStyle`, `backgroundColor`, and `borderColor`.

```dart
FpsWidget(
  textStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 16),
  backgroundColor: Colors.black54,
  borderColor: Colors.green,
  child: RealFlutter(),
);
```

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'FPS Widget Example',
      home: FpsWidget(
        // Wrapping the main widget with FpsWidget to monitor FPS
        child: RealFlutter(),
        textStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 16), // Custom text style
        backgroundColor: Colors.black54, // Background color of the FPS display
        borderColor: Colors.green, // Border color of the FPS display
      ),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('FPS Widget Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Welcome to the FPS Widget Demo!',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Simulating a heavy operation
                for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
                  // This loop is just to simulate some load
                }
              },
              child: Text('Simulate Load'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp that wraps the RealFlutter widget with FpsWidget.
// 3. FpsWidget monitors the FPS and displays it on the screen with the specified styles.
// 4. RealFlutter contains a simple UI with a welcome message and a button.
// 5. When the button is pressed, it simulates a heavy operation, which can be monitored via the FPS display.
```
