# Setting Up and Using flutter_ble_lib_ios_15

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_ble_lib_ios_15` package and provide guidance on how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Installation

To add the `flutter_ble_lib_ios_15` package to your Flutter project, follow these steps:

1. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file.
2. Add the package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     flutter_ble_lib_ios_15: ^latest_version
   ```

3. Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### iOS Configuration
For iOS, you need to ensure that your app has the necessary permissions to use Bluetooth. Add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires Bluetooth access to connect to devices.</string>
<key>NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires Bluetooth access to communicate with peripherals.</string>
```

### Android Configuration
While this package is primarily focused on iOS, if you plan to support Android, ensure you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
```

## Using the Package

To use the `flutter_ble_lib_ios_15` package, you will typically follow these steps:

1. **Initialize the BLE Manager**: Create an instance of the BLE manager.
2. **Scan for Devices**: Start scanning for nearby BLE devices.
3. **Connect to a Device**: Connect to a selected BLE device.
4. **Communicate with the Device**: Send and receive data.
5. **Handle Notifications**: Listen for notifications from the device.

This package provides a straightforward API to manage these operations, making it easy to implement BLE functionalities in your app.

# Complete Example of flutter_ble_lib_ios_15

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_ble_lib_ios_15/flutter_ble_lib_ios_15.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Create a BLE manager instance
  final BleManager _bleManager = BleManager();
  List<Peripheral> _peripherals = []; // List to hold discovered peripherals

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the BLE manager
    _bleManager.createClient().then((_) {
      // Start scanning for devices
      _bleManager.startPeripheralScan().listen((peripheral) {
        // Add discovered peripherals to the list
        setState(() {
          _peripherals.add(peripheral);
        });
      });
    });
  }

  // Function to connect to a selected peripheral
  void _connectToPeripheral(Peripheral peripheral) {
    peripheral.connect().then((_) {
      // Discover services and characteristics after connection
      peripheral.discoverAllServicesAndCharacteristics().then((_) {
        // Handle successful connection and service discovery
        print('Connected to ${peripheral.name}');
      });
    }).catchError((error) {
      // Handle connection errors
      print('Error connecting to peripheral: $error');
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('BLE Example')),
        body: ListView.builder(
          itemCount: _peripherals.length,
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            final peripheral = _peripherals[index];
            return ListTile(
              title: Text(peripheral.name ?? 'Unknown Device'),
              onTap: () => _connectToPeripheral(peripheral), // Connect on tap
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Clean up the BLE manager
    _bleManager.destroyClient();
    super.dispose();
  }
}
```

// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application that uses the flutter_ble_lib_ios_15 package to scan for and connect to BLE devices.
// 
// 1. **Initialization**: The BLE manager is initialized in the `initState` method, which sets up the BLE client.
// 2. **Scanning**: The app starts scanning for nearby BLE devices, and discovered devices are added to the `_peripherals` list.
// 3. **Displaying Devices**: A ListView displays the names of discovered devices. Tapping on a device initiates a connection.
// 4. **Connecting**: The `_connectToPeripheral` method connects to the selected device and discovers its services and characteristics.
// 5. **Cleanup**: The BLE manager is destroyed in the `dispose` method to free up resources when the widget is removed from the tree.

// This application flow allows users to discover and connect to BLE devices easily, showcasing the core functionalities of the flutter_ble_lib_ios_15 package.
