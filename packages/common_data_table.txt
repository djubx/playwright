# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Common Data Table

## Installation
To get started with the `common_data_table` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  common_data_table: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/common_data_table).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
Once the package is installed, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a data table:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:common_data_table/common_data_table.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Common Data Table Example')),
        body: CommonDataTable(
          columns: [
            DataColumn(label: Text('ID')),
            DataColumn(label: Text('Name')),
            DataColumn(label: Text('Age')),
          ],
          rows: [
            DataRow(cells: [DataCell(Text('1')), DataCell(Text('Alice')), DataCell(Text('30'))]),
            DataRow(cells: [DataCell(Text('2')), DataCell(Text('Bob')), DataCell(Text('25'))]),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application with a data table displaying two rows of data. You can expand upon this by adding sorting, filtering, and pagination features as needed.

# Complete Example of Common Data Table

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:common_data_table/common_data_table.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Common Data Table Example')),
        body: CommonDataTable(
          // Define the columns of the data table
          columns: [
            DataColumn(label: Text('ID')),
            DataColumn(label: Text('Name')),
            DataColumn(label: Text('Age')),
          ],
          // Define the rows of the data table
          rows: [
            DataRow(cells: [
              DataCell(Text('1')), // First cell in the first row
              DataCell(Text('Alice')), // Second cell in the first row
              DataCell(Text('30')), // Third cell in the first row
            ]),
            DataRow(cells: [
              DataCell(Text('2')), // First cell in the second row
              DataCell(Text('Bob')), // Second cell in the second row
              DataCell(Text('25')), // Third cell in the second row
            ]),
          ],
          // Enable sorting on the columns
          onSort: (columnIndex, ascending) {
            // Implement sorting logic here
          },
          // Enable pagination
          rowsPerPage: 5, // Set the number of rows per page
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Explanation of the application flow:
// 1. The application starts with the `RealFlutter` class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. Inside the `build` method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// 3. The AppBar displays the title of the application.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a CommonDataTable widget.
// 5. The CommonDataTable is configured with three columns: ID, Name, and Age.
// 6. Two rows of data are defined, each containing three cells corresponding to the columns.
// 7. The `onSort` callback is provided for implementing sorting logic, which can be customized.
// 8. Pagination is enabled with a specified number of rows per page.
```
