# Tutorial

## Setup Process

To get started with the `pull_to_refresh_flutter3` package, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the package dependency:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     pull_to_refresh_flutter3: ^2.0.0
   ```

   Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

2. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

     ```groovy
     android {
         ...
         defaultConfig {
             ...
             minSdkVersion 21
         }
     }
     ```

   - **iOS**: Open your `ios/Podfile` and ensure that the platform is set to at least 10.0:

     ```ruby
     platform :ios, '10.0'
     ```

3. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the package:

   ```dart
   import 'package:pull_to_refresh_flutter3/pull_to_refresh_flutter3.dart';
   ```

## Using the Package

Here’s how to implement the pull-to-refresh functionality in your Flutter app:

1. **Create a Stateful Widget**: This widget will manage the state of the refresh functionality.

2. **Initialize the Refresh Controller**: Use the `RefreshController` to manage the refresh state.

3. **Wrap Your Scrollable Widget**: Use the `SmartRefresher` widget to wrap your scrollable widget (e.g., `ListView`).

4. **Define the Refresh Logic**: Implement the logic that will be executed when the user pulls to refresh.

Here’s a simple example of how to set this up:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pull_to_refresh_flutter3/pull_to_refresh_flutter3.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  List<String> items = List.generate(20, (index) => "Item $index");
  RefreshController _refreshController = RefreshController(initialRefresh: false);

  void _onRefresh() async {
    // Simulate a network request
    await Future.delayed(Duration(milliseconds: 1000));
    // Update the items list
    setState(() {
      items.insert(0, "New Item ${items.length}");
    });
    // Complete the refresh
    _refreshController.refreshCompleted();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Pull to Refresh Example")),
      body: SmartRefresher(
        controller: _refreshController,
        onRefresh: _onRefresh,
        child: ListView.builder(
          itemCount: items.length,
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            return ListTile(title: Text(items[index]));
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Stateful Widget**: The `RealFlutter` class is a stateful widget that maintains the state of the list and the refresh controller.
- **Refresh Controller**: The `_refreshController` is initialized to manage the refresh state.
- **_onRefresh Method**: This method simulates a network request and updates the list of items. After the update, it calls `_refreshController.refreshCompleted()` to indicate that the refresh is complete.
- **SmartRefresher**: The `SmartRefresher` widget wraps the `ListView.builder`, providing the pull-to-refresh functionality.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pull_to_refresh_flutter3/pull_to_refresh_flutter3.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // List to hold the items displayed in the ListView
  List<String> items = List.generate(20, (index) => "Item $index");
  
  // Controller to manage the refresh state
  RefreshController _refreshController = RefreshController(initialRefresh: false);

  // Method to handle the refresh action
  void _onRefresh() async {
    // Simulate a network request with a delay
    await Future.delayed(Duration(milliseconds: 1000));
    
    // Update the items list by adding a new item at the top
    setState(() {
      items.insert(0, "New Item ${items.length}");
    });
    
    // Complete the refresh action
    _refreshController.refreshCompleted();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Pull to Refresh Example")),
      body: SmartRefresher(
        // Assign the refresh controller
        controller: _refreshController,
        // Define the refresh callback
        onRefresh: _onRefresh,
        child: ListView.builder(
          // Build the list of items
          itemCount: items.length,
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            return ListTile(title: Text(items[index])); // Display each item
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which is a stateful widget.
// 2. The _RealFlutterState class manages the state of the list and the refresh controller.
// 3. The items list is initialized with 20 items.
// 4. The SmartRefresher widget wraps the ListView.builder, enabling pull-to-refresh functionality.
// 5. When the user pulls down to refresh, the _onRefresh method is called.
// 6. Inside _onRefresh, a simulated network request is made with a delay.
// 7. After the delay, a new item is added to the top of the list.
// 8. Finally, the refresh controller is notified that the refresh is complete, and the UI updates to reflect the new item.
```
