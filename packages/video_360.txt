# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Video_360 Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `video_360` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the `video_360` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  video_360: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/video_360).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to the camera for 360 video playback.</string>
   <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your photo library to load videos.</string>
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `video_360` package.

# Complete Example of Using the Video_360 Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:video_360/video_360.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: '360 Video Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: Video360Screen(),
    );
  }
}

class Video360Screen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('360 Video Player'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        // The Video360 widget is used to display the 360-degree video.
        child: Video360(
          // Provide the URL or asset path of the 360 video.
          video: 'https://example.com/path/to/your/360video.mp4',
          // Optional: Set the initial view angle.
          initialViewAngle: 0.0,
          // Optional: Enable or disable gyroscope support.
          enableGyroscope: true,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to Video360Screen, which is another StatelessWidget.
// 4. Video360Screen builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, the Video360 widget is instantiated with the video URL and optional parameters.
// 6. The Video360 widget handles the playback of the 360-degree video, allowing users to interact with it using touch or gyroscope controls.
```

// The above code demonstrates how to set up a simple Flutter application that plays a 360-degree video using the video_360 package. The application consists of a main function that initializes the app, a RealFlutter widget that sets up the MaterialApp, and a Video360Screen widget that contains the video player. The Video360 widget is configured with a video URL and optional parameters for initial view angle and gyroscope support. Users can interact with the video by looking around or using touch gestures, providing an immersive experience.
