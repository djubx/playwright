# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Flashy Flushbar

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with flashy_flushbar, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flashy_flushbar: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the flashy_flushbar package:

```dart
import 'package:flashy_flushbar/flashy_flushbar.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using Flashy Flushbar

### Basic Usage

You can create a basic notification using the following code snippet:

```dart
FlashyFlushbar(
  title: 'Success!',
  message: 'Your data has been saved successfully.',
  icon: Icon(Icons.check, color: Colors.white),
  duration: Duration(seconds: 3),
).show(context);
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions for internet access if your notifications require it. Typically, no additional configuration is needed for flashy_flushbar.

#### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your app's deployment target is set to at least iOS 9.0 in your `ios/Podfile`. You may also need to configure your app's permissions if you are using notifications that require user consent.

### Customization Options

You can customize the appearance of the Flushbar by modifying its properties:

```dart
FlashyFlushbar(
  title: 'Error!',
  message: 'An error occurred while saving your data.',
  icon: Icon(Icons.error, color: Colors.white),
  backgroundColor: Colors.red,
  duration: Duration(seconds: 5),
  borderRadius: 8.0,
  margin: EdgeInsets.all(10),
).show(context);
```

This example shows how to change the background color, duration, border radius, and margin of the notification.

# Complete Example: Using Flashy Flushbar in a Flutter App

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flashy_flushbar/flashy_flushbar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// MyApp is the main widget of the application
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flashy Flushbar Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

// HomeScreen is the main screen of the application
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flashy Flushbar Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Show a success notification when the button is pressed
            FlashyFlushbar(
              title: 'Success!',
              message: 'Your action was successful.',
              icon: Icon(Icons.check, color: Colors.white),
              duration: Duration(seconds: 3),
            ).show(context);
          },
          child: Text('Show Success Notification'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The app starts and runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds the MaterialApp and sets HomeScreen as the home widget.
// 3. HomeScreen displays a button in the center of the screen.
// 4. When the button is pressed, a FlashyFlushbar notification is shown.
// 5. The notification displays a success message and automatically dismisses after 3 seconds.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the flashy_flushbar package. The application consists of a single screen with a button. When the button is pressed, a success notification appears at the bottom of the screen, informing the user that their action was successful. The notification automatically disappears after a specified duration, enhancing the user experience without requiring any additional interaction.

In summary, the flashy_flushbar package is a versatile tool for displaying notifications in Flutter applications. Its customization options and ease of use make it an excellent choice for developers looking to enhance user engagement through effective messaging.
