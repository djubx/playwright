# Tutorial: Setting Up Firebase UI Auth in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `firebase_ui_auth` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependencies

First, you need to add the `firebase_ui_auth` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. You also need to include the Firebase core and authentication packages.

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  firebase_core: ^2.0.0
  firebase_auth: ^4.0.0
  firebase_ui_auth: ^0.5.0
```

## Step 2: Configure Firebase

### For Android

1. Go to the Firebase Console and create a new project.
2. Add an Android app to your project and download the `google-services.json` file.
3. Place the `google-services.json` file in the `android/app` directory.
4. Modify your `android/build.gradle` file to include the Google services classpath:

```groovy
buildscript {
    dependencies {
        // Add this line
        classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.10'
    }
}
```

5. In your `android/app/build.gradle`, apply the Google services plugin:

```groovy
apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
```

### For iOS

1. In the Firebase Console, add an iOS app to your project and download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file.
2. Place the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file in the `ios/Runner` directory.
3. Open your `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode and ensure that the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file is included in your project.

## Step 3: Initialize Firebase

In your `main.dart` file, initialize Firebase before running the app:

```dart
import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await Firebase.initializeApp();
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 4: Using Firebase UI Auth

Now that we have set up Firebase, we can use the `firebase_ui_auth` package to create authentication screens. Hereâ€™s how to implement a simple authentication flow using the package.

# Complete Example: Firebase UI Auth in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:firebase_auth/firebase_auth.dart'; // Import Firebase Auth
import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart'; // Import Firebase Core
import 'package:firebase_ui_auth/firebase_ui_auth.dart'; // Import Firebase UI Auth
import 'package:flutter/material.dart'; // Import Flutter Material package

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized(); // Ensure Flutter binding is initialized
  await Firebase.initializeApp(); // Initialize Firebase
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the main app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Firebase UI Auth Example', // Set the app title
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue), // Define the app theme
      home: AuthGate(), // Set the home widget to AuthGate
    );
  }
}

class AuthGate extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return StreamBuilder<User?>(
      stream: FirebaseAuth.instance.authStateChanges(), // Listen to auth state changes
      builder: (context, snapshot) {
        if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
          return Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator()); // Show loading indicator
        } else if (snapshot.hasData) {
          return HomeScreen(); // User is signed in, show home screen
        } else {
          return SignInScreen(); // User is not signed in, show sign-in screen
        }
      },
    );
  }
}

class SignInScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Sign In')), // App bar with title
      body: Center(
        child: SignInScreen( // Firebase UI Auth SignInScreen widget
          providerConfigs: [
            EmailProviderConfiguration(), // Email provider
            GoogleProviderConfiguration(clientId: 'YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID'), // Google provider
          ],
          headerBuilder: (context, constraints, _) {
            return Padding(
              padding: const EdgeInsets.all(20.0),
              child: Text('Welcome to Firebase UI Auth', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24)), // Custom header
            );
          },
          onSignedIn: (user) {
            // Handle user sign-in
            print('User signed in: ${user.email}');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home'), // App bar with title
        actions: [
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.logout), // Logout button
            onPressed: () async {
              await FirebaseAuth.instance.signOut(); // Sign out user
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
      body: Center(child: Text('Welcome to the Home Screen!')), // Home screen content
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, initializing Firebase and running the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds the MaterialApp and sets AuthGate as the home widget.
// 3. AuthGate listens to the authentication state using a StreamBuilder.
// 4. If the user is signed in, it navigates to HomeScreen; otherwise, it shows SignInScreen.
// 5. SignInScreen provides options for email and Google sign-in.
// 6. Upon successful sign-in, the user is redirected to HomeScreen, where they can log out.
// 7. The HomeScreen displays a welcome message and a logout button.
```
