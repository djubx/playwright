# Flutter Focus Watcher Package

The `flutter_focus_watcher` package is a powerful tool designed to help developers manage focus changes in their Flutter applications. It provides a way to monitor and respond to focus changes across various widgets, making it particularly useful for applications that require dynamic user interfaces or need to handle keyboard input effectively.

## When to Use

You might consider using the `flutter_focus_watcher` package in scenarios such as:

- **Form Validation**: Automatically validate fields when they lose focus.
- **Dynamic UI Updates**: Change the UI based on which widget currently has focus.
- **Keyboard Management**: Dismiss the keyboard when a user taps outside of a text field.

## Features

- **Focus Tracking**: Easily track which widget currently has focus.
- **Callbacks**: Register callbacks to respond to focus changes.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.

By leveraging this package, developers can create more interactive and user-friendly applications that respond intuitively to user input.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_focus_watcher

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_focus_watcher` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_focus_watcher: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_focus_watcher/flutter_focus_watcher.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Setup

Wrap your application or the specific widget tree you want to monitor with the `FocusWatcher` widget. This widget will listen for focus changes and notify its children.

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` has the necessary configurations, especially if you are using features that require specific permissions or configurations.

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, ensure that your app's Info.plist is configured correctly, especially if you are using any features that require permissions.

## Step 4: Using FocusWatcher

You can now use the `FocusWatcher` widget to monitor focus changes. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
FocusWatcher(
  onFocusChange: (FocusNode node) {
    // Handle focus change
    print('Focus changed to: ${node.debugLabel}');
  },
  child: YourWidgetTree(),
);
```

This setup will allow you to respond to focus changes within the specified widget tree.

# Complete Example of flutter_focus_watcher

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_focus_watcher/flutter_focus_watcher.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Focus Watcher Example',
      home: FocusWatcher(
        // This callback is triggered whenever the focus changes
        onFocusChange: (FocusNode node) {
          // Print the debug label of the focused node
          print('Focus changed to: ${node.debugLabel}');
        },
        child: Scaffold(
          appBar: AppBar(
            title: Text('Focus Watcher Demo'),
          ),
          body: Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
            child: Column(
              children: [
                TextField(
                  focusNode: FocusNode(debugLabel: 'TextField 1'),
                  decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter Text 1'),
                ),
                TextField(
                  focusNode: FocusNode(debugLabel: 'TextField 2'),
                  decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter Text 2'),
                ),
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () {
                    // Dismiss the keyboard when the button is pressed
                    FocusScope.of(context).unfocus();
                  },
                  child: Text('Dismiss Keyboard'),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a FocusWatcher.
// 3. The FocusWatcher listens for focus changes and triggers the onFocusChange callback.
// 4. Inside the Scaffold, there are two TextFields and a button.
// 5. Each TextField has a FocusNode with a debug label for identification.
// 6. When a TextField gains or loses focus, the onFocusChange callback prints the debug label of the focused node.
// 7. Pressing the button dismisses the keyboard by unfocusing the current input field.
