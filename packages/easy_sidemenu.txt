To get started, add the **easy_sidemenu** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  easy_sidemenu: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/easy_sidemenu).

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:easy_sidemenu/easy_sidemenu.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions and configurations. Typically, no special configurations are needed for the **easy_sidemenu** package, but ensure your app's theme is set up correctly.

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, ensure that your `Info.plist` file is configured correctly. Again, no specific configurations are required for the **easy_sidemenu** package, but ensure your app's deployment target is set appropriately.

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the **easy_sidemenu** package in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a side menu.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:easy_sidemenu/easy_sidemenu.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Easy Sidemenu Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Easy Sidemenu Example')),
      body: SideMenu(
        items: [
          SideMenuItem(
            icon: Icons.home,
            title: 'Home',
            onTap: () {
              // Handle Home tap
            },
          ),
          SideMenuItem(
            icon: Icons.settings,
            title: 'Settings',
            onTap: () {
              // Handle Settings tap
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application with a side menu containing two items: Home and Settings. You can customize the menu items and their actions as needed.

# Complete Example of Easy Sidemenu

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:easy_sidemenu/easy_sidemenu.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// Main application widget
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Easy Sidemenu Example',
      home: RealFlutter(), // Entry point of the application
    );
  }
}

// Main widget for the side menu
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Easy Sidemenu Example')), // App bar title
      body: SideMenu(
        // Side menu widget
        items: [
          SideMenuItem(
            icon: Icons.home, // Icon for Home
            title: 'Home', // Title for Home
            onTap: () {
              // Action for Home tap
              print('Home tapped');
            },
          ),
          SideMenuItem(
            icon: Icons.settings, // Icon for Settings
            title: 'Settings', // Title for Settings
            onTap: () {
              // Action for Settings tap
              print('Settings tapped');
            },
          ),
          SideMenuItem(
            icon: Icons.info, // Icon for About
            title: 'About', // Title for About
            onTap: () {
              // Action for About tap
              print('About tapped');
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp and specifies RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a SideMenu.
// 4. The SideMenu contains three items: Home, Settings, and About.
// 5. Each SideMenuItem has an icon, title, and onTap action that prints a message to the console when tapped.
