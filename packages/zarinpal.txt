# Tutorial: Setting Up Zarinpal in Your Flutter App

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the Zarinpal Flutter package and demonstrate how to use it in your application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the Zarinpal package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  zarinpal: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add internet permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the Zarinpal package:

```dart
import 'package:zarinpal/zarinpal.dart';
```

## Step 4: Initialize Zarinpal

You need to initialize Zarinpal with your merchant ID before making any payment requests. This is typically done in your main application file or wherever you handle payment logic.

```dart
void main() {
  Zarinpal.init('YOUR_MERCHANT_ID'); // Replace with your actual merchant ID
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 5: Making a Payment

To make a payment, you can use the following method:

```dart
void makePayment() async {
  var response = await Zarinpal.requestPayment(
    amount: 10000, // Amount in Toman
    description: 'Payment for order #1234',
    callbackUrl: 'https://yourcallbackurl.com', // Your callback URL
  );

  if (response.status == 100) {
    // Payment was successful
    print('Payment successful: ${response.authority}');
  } else {
    // Handle payment failure
    print('Payment failed: ${response.error}');
  }
}
```

This method initiates a payment request and handles the response accordingly.

By following these steps, you can successfully integrate the Zarinpal payment gateway into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Zarinpal Integration

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:zarinpal/zarinpal.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize Zarinpal with your merchant ID
  Zarinpal.init('YOUR_MERCHANT_ID'); // Replace with your actual merchant ID
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Zarinpal Payment Example',
      home: PaymentScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PaymentScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Zarinpal Payment'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Trigger the payment process when the button is pressed
            makePayment();
          },
          child: Text('Pay Now'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void makePayment() async {
    // Request payment from Zarinpal
    var response = await Zarinpal.requestPayment(
      amount: 10000, // Amount in Toman
      description: 'Payment for order #1234',
      callbackUrl: 'https://yourcallbackurl.com', // Your callback URL
    );

    // Check the response status
    if (response.status == 100) {
      // Payment was successful
      print('Payment successful: ${response.authority}');
    } else {
      // Handle payment failure
      print('Payment failed: ${response.error}');
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts by initializing Zarinpal with the merchant ID.
// 2. The main widget is built, which contains a button to initiate the payment process.
// 3. When the button is pressed, the `makePayment` function is called.
// 4. The `makePayment` function sends a payment request to Zarinpal with the specified amount and description.
// 5. The response from Zarinpal is checked; if the status is 100, the payment is successful, and the authority is printed.
// 6. If the payment fails, the error message is printed.
```
