For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

# Complete Example of Using Calendar Timeline

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:calendar_timeline/calendar_timeline.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Calendar Timeline Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Calendar Timeline Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: CalendarTimeline(
          // Setting the initial date to today
          initialDate: DateTime.now(),
          // Setting the first date of the timeline
          firstDate: DateTime(2020, 1, 1),
          // Setting the last date of the timeline
          lastDate: DateTime(2025, 12, 31),
          // Setting the onTap callback to handle date selection
          onDateSelected: (date) {
            // Displaying a snackbar with the selected date
            ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
              SnackBar(content: Text('Selected date: ${date.toLocal()}')),
            );
          },
          // Customizing the day and month text styles
          monthTextStyle: TextStyle(
            fontSize: 20,
            fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
          ),
          dayTextStyle: TextStyle(
            fontSize: 16,
            color: Colors.black,
          ),
          // Customizing the selected date's style
          selectedDayTextStyle: TextStyle(
            color: Colors.white,
          ),
          selectedMonthTextStyle: TextStyle(
            color: Colors.white,
          ),
          // Customizing the background color of the selected date
          selectedDateBackgroundColor: Colors.blue,
          // Customizing the background color of the timeline
          backgroundColor: Colors.grey[200],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home of the app is set to RealFlutter, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 4. In RealFlutter, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a body.
// 5. The body contains a CalendarTimeline widget, which displays a timeline of dates.
// 6. The initial date is set to the current date, and the timeline spans from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2025.
// 7. When a date is selected, a Snackbar is shown with the selected date.
// 8. The text styles for the month and day are customized, along with the selected date's appearance.
