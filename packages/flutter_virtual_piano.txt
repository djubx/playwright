# Tutorial: Setting Up the Flutter Virtual Piano Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_virtual_piano` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the `flutter_virtual_piano` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_virtual_piano: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Install Dependencies
Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable audio capabilities in your `Info.plist` file. Add the following key:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the microphone for audio features.</string>
```

## Step 4: Import the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_virtual_piano/flutter_virtual_piano.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package
You can now use the `RealFlutter` class to create a virtual piano. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it in your Flutter app.

# Complete Example of a Virtual Piano Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_virtual_piano/flutter_virtual_piano.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Virtual Piano',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(), // Main entry point for the virtual piano
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Virtual Piano'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: VirtualPiano(
          onNotePressed: (note) {
            // This callback is triggered when a note is pressed
            print('Note pressed: $note');
          },
          // You can customize the appearance of the piano here
          pianoKeysColor: Colors.white,
          pianoKeysPressedColor: Colors.red,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets MyApp as the root widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to RealFlutter, which is the main widget for the piano.
// 4. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a VirtualPiano widget.
// 5. The VirtualPiano widget has an onNotePressed callback that prints the note being played.
// 6. The piano keys can be customized using the pianoKeysColor and pianoKeysPressedColor properties.
```
