# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using fl_downloader

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `fl_downloader` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `fl_downloader` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  fl_downloader: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, you need to ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the internet and write to external storage. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to add the following permissions in your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save downloaded files.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio downloads.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to implement file downloading using the `fl_downloader` package.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fl_downloader/fl_downloader.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to hold the download task ID
  String? taskId;
  // Variable to track download progress
  double progress = 0.0;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the downloader
    FlDownloader.initialize();
  }

  // Function to start the download
  void startDownload() async {
    // Start downloading a file
    taskId = await FlDownloader.download(
      url: 'https://example.com/file.zip', // URL of the file to download
      saveTo: '/path/to/save/file.zip', // Path to save the downloaded file
      onProgress: (current, total) {
        // Update the progress
        setState(() {
          progress = current / total; // Calculate progress percentage
        });
      },
      onComplete: () {
        // Notify user when download is complete
        ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
          SnackBar(content: Text('Download Complete!')),
        );
      },
      onError: (error) {
        // Handle any errors during download
        ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
          SnackBar(content: Text('Download Failed: $error')),
        );
      },
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('File Downloader')),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Display download progress
              LinearProgressIndicator(value: progress),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Button to start the download
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: startDownload,
                child: Text('Download File'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget, we initialize the FlDownloader in the initState method.
// 3. The startDownload function is called when the user presses the "Download File" button.
// 4. The FlDownloader.download method is invoked with the file URL and save path.
// 5. The onProgress callback updates the progress variable, which is reflected in the LinearProgressIndicator.
// 6. When the download completes, a SnackBar notification is shown to the user.
// 7. If an error occurs during the download, an error message is displayed in a SnackBar.
