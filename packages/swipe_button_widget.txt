# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `swipe_button_widget`

```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash

## Platform-Specific Configuration

## Basic Usage
To use the `swipe_button_widget`, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart

```

You can then create a simple swipe button as follows:

# Complete Example of `swipe_button_widget`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:swipe_button_widget/swipe_button_widget.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Swipe Button Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Swipe Button Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: SwipeButton(
            onSwipe: () {
              // Action to perform on swipe
              ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                SnackBar(content: Text("Action Confirmed!")),
              );
            },
            child: Container(
              width: 200,
              height: 50,
              alignment: Alignment.center,
              decoration: BoxDecoration(
                color: Colors.blue,
                borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(25),
              ),
              child: Text(
                "Swipe to Confirm",
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 18),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code sets up a simple Flutter application with a swipe button.
// 1. The `main` function initializes the app by calling `runApp` with the `RealFlutter` widget.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` class builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title "Swipe Button Demo".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 5. The child is a `SwipeButton` widget that takes an `onSwipe` callback.
// 6. When the button is swiped, a SnackBar is displayed with the message "Action Confirmed!".
// 7. The button itself is styled with a blue background, rounded corners, and centered text.
// 8. The text "Swipe to Confirm" is displayed in white color, making it stand out against the blue background.

// This example demonstrates how to implement a swipe button that confirms an action with a visual feedback (SnackBar) when swiped.
