# Overview of the `value_state` Flutter Package

The `value_state` package is a lightweight state management solution for Flutter applications. It provides a simple and efficient way to manage state by allowing developers to create reactive value holders that can notify listeners when their values change. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to manage simple state without the overhead of more complex state management solutions like Provider or Bloc.

## When to Use `value_state`

- **Simple State Management**: Ideal for applications that require straightforward state management without the complexity of larger frameworks.
- **Reactive Programming**: When you want to create reactive UI components that automatically update when the underlying state changes.
- **Performance**: Suitable for performance-sensitive applications where you want to minimize the overhead of state management.

## Key Features

- **Reactive Values**: Automatically notify listeners when the value changes.
- **Lightweight**: Minimalistic design with a small footprint, making it easy to integrate into existing projects.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple API that allows for quick setup and usage.

# Setting Up and Using the `value_state` Package

## Installation

To use the `value_state` package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  value_state: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that you have the latest version of Xcode installed. No additional configurations are necessary for using `value_state`.

## Basic Usage

To use the `value_state` package, you can create a `ValueState` object that holds your state. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set it up:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:value_state/value_state.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a ValueState to hold an integer value
    final counter = ValueState<int>(0);

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Value State Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ValueListener<int>(
            value: counter,
            builder: (context, value) {
              return Text('Counter: $value');
            },
          ),
        ),
        floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Increment the counter value
            counter.value++;
          },
          child: Icon(Icons.add),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a `ValueState` to hold an integer counter. The `ValueListener` widget listens for changes to the counter and rebuilds the UI whenever the value changes.

# Complete Example of Using `value_state`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:value_state/value_state.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a ValueState to hold an integer value
    final counter = ValueState<int>(0);

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Value State Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Use ValueListener to listen for changes in the counter
          child: ValueListener<int>(
            value: counter,
            builder: (context, value) {
              // Display the current value of the counter
              return Text('Counter: $value', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24));
            },
          ),
        ),
        floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Increment the counter value when the button is pressed
            counter.value++;
          },
          child: Icon(Icons.add),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. Inside RealFlutter, a ValueState named 'counter' is created to hold an integer value.
// 3. The MaterialApp widget is built, containing a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. The ValueListener widget listens for changes in the 'counter' value and rebuilds its child whenever the value changes.
// 5. The Text widget displays the current value of the counter.
// 6. A FloatingActionButton is provided to increment the counter value when pressed.
// 7. When the button is pressed, the counter's value is incremented, triggering the ValueListener to rebuild and update the displayed counter value.
