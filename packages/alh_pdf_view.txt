# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using alh_pdf_view

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `alh_pdf_view` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  alh_pdf_view: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/alh_pdf_view).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the PDF viewer.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:alh_pdf_view/alh_pdf_view.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'PDF Viewer Example',
      home: PDFViewerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PDFViewerScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('PDF Viewer'),
      ),
      body: PDFView(
        filePath: 'assets/sample.pdf', // Path to your PDF file
        onPageChanged: (int page, int total) {
          print('Page $page of $total');
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays a PDF file. The `PDFView` widget is used to render the PDF, and we can listen for page changes using the `onPageChanged` callback.

# Complete Example of alh_pdf_view

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:alh_pdf_view/alh_pdf_view.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'PDF Viewer Example',
      home: PDFViewerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PDFViewerScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('PDF Viewer'),
      ),
      body: PDFView(
        filePath: 'assets/sample.pdf', // Path to your PDF file
        onPageChanged: (int page, int total) {
          // This callback is triggered when the page changes
          print('Page $page of $total');
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter class builds the MaterialApp with a title and home screen.
// 3. The PDFViewerScreen class creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body contains the PDFView widget, which takes the file path of the PDF.
// 5. The onPageChanged callback prints the current page and total pages to the console.
// 6. The user can scroll through the PDF and see the page changes reflected in the console.
