# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Banuba SDK

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the Banuba SDK in a Flutter application, including platform-specific configurations for both Android and iOS.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the Banuba SDK Flutter package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  banuba_sdk: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Add the necessary permissions and metadata in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.yourapp">

    <application
        android:label="Your App"
        android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher">
        
        <meta-data
            android:name="banuba_sdk_key"
            android:value="YOUR_BANUBA_SDK_KEY" />
        
        <activity
            android:name="com.banuba.sdk.BanubaActivity"
            android:theme="@style/Theme.AppCompat.NoActionBar">
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN"/>
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER"/>
            </intent-filter>
        </activity>
    </application>
</manifest>
```

2. **Add Permissions**: Ensure you have the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera for AR features.</string>
<key>banuba_sdk_key</key>
<string>YOUR_BANUBA_SDK_KEY</string>
```

2. **Enable Camera Usage**: Ensure that your app has permission to use the camera.

## Step 3: Using the Banuba SDK

Now that we have set up the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to initialize and use the Banuba SDK.

# Complete Example: Using Banuba SDK in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:banuba_sdk/banuba_sdk.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Declare a Banuba SDK instance
  late BanubaSdk _banubaSdk;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the Banuba SDK
    _banubaSdk = BanubaSdk();
    _initializeBanuba();
  }

  // Method to initialize the Banuba SDK
  Future<void> _initializeBanuba() async {
    try {
      // Start the SDK
      await _banubaSdk.start();
      // Load effects or any other setup
      await _banubaSdk.loadEffects();
    } catch (e) {
      print("Error initializing Banuba SDK: $e");
    }
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the SDK when the widget is removed
    _banubaSdk.stop();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Banuba SDK Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Start the AR experience
              _banubaSdk.startAR();
            },
            child: Text('Start AR'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget, we initialize the Banuba SDK in the initState method.
// 3. The _initializeBanuba method starts the SDK and loads any necessary effects.
// 4. When the user presses the "Start AR" button, the AR experience is launched.
// 5. The SDK is stopped in the dispose method to free up resources when the widget is removed.
```
