# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Fancy Text Reveal

## Installation

  fancy_text_reveal: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Then, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if you are using any features that require user permissions. However, for basic text reveal functionality, no special permissions are needed.

## Using the Package
To use the **fancy_text_reveal** package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:fancy_text_reveal/fancy_text_reveal.dart';
```

You can then use the `FancyTextReveal` widget in your widget tree. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
FancyTextReveal(
  text: "Hello, Flutter!",
  duration: Duration(seconds: 2),
  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold, color: Colors.blue),
)
```

This will create a text reveal animation for the string "Hello, Flutter!" over a duration of 2 seconds.

            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Using FancyTextReveal to display a text with animation

                text: "Welcome to Flutter!",
                duration: Duration(seconds: 3), // Duration of the reveal animation
                style: TextStyle(
                  fontSize: 30, // Font size of the text
                  fontWeight: FontWeight.bold, // Font weight
                  color: Colors.green, // Text color
                ),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between texts
              FancyTextReveal(
                text: "Enjoy building apps!",
                duration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Duration of the reveal animation
                style: TextStyle(
                  fontSize: 24, // Font size of the text
                  fontWeight: FontWeight.w600, // Font weight
                  color: Colors.orange, // Text color
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Fancy Text Reveal Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Column widget.
// 5. Inside the Column, two FancyTextReveal widgets are used to display animated text.
// 6. Each FancyTextReveal widget has a specified text, duration for the reveal animation, and text styling.
// 7. The first text "Welcome to Flutter!" is revealed over 3 seconds, while the second text "Enjoy building apps!" is revealed over 2 seconds.
// 8. The app provides a visually appealing way to present text, enhancing user engagement.
