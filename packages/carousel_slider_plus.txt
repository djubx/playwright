    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app, and the `RealFlutter` widget is created.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` widget builds the app's UI, including the `CarouselSliderPlus` widget.
// 3. The `CarouselSliderPlus` widget displays the carousel slider with the specified items and options.
// 4. The user can interact with the carousel slider (e.g., swipe, tap).
// 5. The carousel slider responds to user input and updates its state accordingly.
// 6. The app continues to run and display the carousel slider until the user closes it.
