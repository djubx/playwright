# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Flexible Expansion List

## Installation
To get started with the `flexible_expansion_list` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flexible_expansion_list: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flexible_expansion_list).

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No specific configurations are required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your expandable list interacts with any device features.

## Basic Usage
To use the `flexible_expansion_list`, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:
   ```dart
   import 'package:flexible_expansion_list/flexible_expansion_list.dart';
   ```

2. Create a list of items that you want to display in an expandable format.

3. Use the `FlexibleExpansionList` widget to wrap your list items.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
FlexibleExpansionList(
  items: [
    FlexibleExpansionItem(
      title: Text('Item 1'),
      content: Text('Details about Item 1'),
    ),
    FlexibleExpansionItem(
      title: Text('Item 2'),
      content: Text('Details about Item 2'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

This will create a basic expandable list with two items. You can customize the appearance and behavior further as needed.

# Complete Example of Flexible Expansion List

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flexible_expansion_list/flexible_expansion_list.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flexible Expansion List Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flexible Expansion List'),
        ),
        body: FlexibleExpansionList(
          items: [
            // Each item in the list is a FlexibleExpansionItem
            FlexibleExpansionItem(
              title: Text('Item 1'),
              content: Column(
                children: [
                  Text('Details about Item 1'),
                  // Additional content can be added here
                  Text('More information about Item 1'),
                ],
              ),
            ),
            FlexibleExpansionItem(
              title: Text('Item 2'),
              content: Column(
                children: [
                  Text('Details about Item 2'),
                  // Additional content can be added here
                  Text('More information about Item 2'),
                ],
              ),
            ),
            FlexibleExpansionItem(
              title: Text('Item 3'),
              content: Column(
                children: [
                  Text('Details about Item 3'),
                  // Additional content can be added here
                  Text('More information about Item 3'),
                ],
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Flexible Expansion List'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold includes a FlexibleExpansionList widget.
// 5. The FlexibleExpansionList widget takes a list of FlexibleExpansionItem widgets.
// 6. Each FlexibleExpansionItem has a title and content, which can be expanded or collapsed.
// 7. The content can include any widget, allowing for a flexible layout.
// 8. When an item is tapped, it expands to show more details, enhancing user interaction.
