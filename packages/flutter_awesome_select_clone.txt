// The app starts by running the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// The MyApp widget builds the MaterialApp, which is the root widget of the app.
// The MaterialApp has a title and a theme, and it builds the MyHomePage widget.
// The MyHomePage widget is a stateful widget, which means it has its own state.
// The state is used to store the selected value.
// The MyHomePage widget builds a Scaffold, which is a basic material design layout.
// The Scaffold has an AppBar and a body.
// The body is a Center widget, which centers its child.
// The child is a Column widget, which is a vertical layout.
// The Column has two children: an AwesomeSelect widget and a Text widget.
// The AwesomeSelect widget is used to select an option.
// The Text widget displays the selected value.
// When an option is selected, the onChanged callback is called, which updates the state.
// The state is then used to display the selected value.
