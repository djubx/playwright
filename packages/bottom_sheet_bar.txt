# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Bottom Sheet Bar Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **bottom_sheet_bar** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  bottom_sheet_bar: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:bottom_sheet_bar/bottom_sheet_bar.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Setup

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Bottom Sheet Bar

You can now use the **BottomSheetBar** widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
BottomSheetBar(
  title: 'Options',
  items: [
    BottomSheetBarItem(
      icon: Icons.home,
      label: 'Home',
      onTap: () {
        // Handle home action
      },
    ),
    BottomSheetBarItem(
      icon: Icons.settings,
      label: 'Settings',
      onTap: () {
        // Handle settings action
      },
    ),
  ],
);
```

This code snippet creates a bottom sheet with two options: Home and Settings. Each option has an icon and a label, and you can define what happens when the user taps on each item.

# Complete Example of Using the Bottom Sheet Bar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bottom_sheet_bar/bottom_sheet_bar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Bottom Sheet Bar Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Bottom Sheet Bar Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Show the bottom sheet when the button is pressed
              showModalBottomSheet(
                context: context,
                builder: (context) {
                  return BottomSheetBar(
                    title: 'Options',
                    items: [
                      BottomSheetBarItem(
                        icon: Icons.home,
                        label: 'Home',
                        onTap: () {
                          // Handle home action
                          Navigator.pop(context); // Close the bottom sheet
                          print('Home tapped');
                        },
                      ),
                      BottomSheetBarItem(
                        icon: Icons.settings,
                        label: 'Settings',
                        onTap: () {
                          // Handle settings action
                          Navigator.pop(context); // Close the bottom sheet
                          print('Settings tapped');
                        },
                      ),
                    ],
                  );
                },
              );
            },
            child: Text('Show Bottom Sheet'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'Bottom Sheet Bar Example'.
// 4. The body contains a Center widget with an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, a modal bottom sheet is displayed using showModalBottomSheet.
// 6. The BottomSheetBar widget is created with a title and two items: Home and Settings.
// 7. Each item has an onTap function that closes the bottom sheet and prints a message to the console.
```

// Final Summary:
// The application starts by displaying a button in the center of the screen. When the button is pressed, a modal bottom sheet appears, showing two options: Home and Settings. Tapping on either option will close the bottom sheet and print a message to the console, demonstrating how to handle user interactions with the bottom sheet items.
