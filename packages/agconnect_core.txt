# Setting Up and Using agconnect_core

## Installation

To add the `agconnect_core` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  agconnect_core: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/agconnect_core).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Add the necessary permissions and metadata in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<manifest>
    <application>
        <!-- Add this metadata -->
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.huawei.agconnect.api.key"
            android:value="YOUR_APP_KEY" />
    </application>
</manifest>
```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure your `android/build.gradle` file includes the Huawei Maven repository:

```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url 'https://developer.huawei.com/repo/maven/' }
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Add the necessary configurations in your `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>AGConnectAppKey</key>
<string>YOUR_APP_KEY</string>
```

2. **CocoaPods**: Ensure you have the latest version of CocoaPods installed and run `pod install` in the `ios` directory.

## Basic Usage

After setting up the package, you can start using its features. Hereâ€™s a simple example of initializing the package and tracking an event.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:agconnect_core/agconnect_core.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Initialize AGConnect
    AGConnectCore.initialize();

    // Track an event
    AGConnectAnalytics.getInstance().onEvent("app_opened");

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('AGConnect Core Example')),
        body: Center(child: Text('Welcome to AGConnect Core!')),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize the `agconnect_core` package and track an event when the app is opened.

# Complete Example of agconnect_core

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:agconnect_core/agconnect_core.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Initialize AGConnect
    AGConnectCore.initialize();

    // Track an event when the app is opened
    AGConnectAnalytics.getInstance().onEvent("app_opened");

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('AGConnect Core Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Track a button click event
              AGConnectAnalytics.getInstance().onEvent("button_clicked");
              // Show a snackbar to confirm the event tracking
              ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                SnackBar(content: Text('Button Clicked! Event Tracked.')),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Click Me!'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget, AGConnect is initialized to set up the connection to Huawei services.
// 3. An event "app_opened" is tracked when the app is launched.
// 4. The app displays a simple UI with an AppBar and a button.
// 5. When the button is clicked, another event "button_clicked" is tracked.
// 6. A snackbar message is shown to the user confirming that the event has been tracked.
