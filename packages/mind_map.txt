Here's a detailed technical blog on the "mind_map" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Mind Map Flutter Package

The **mind_map** Flutter package is a powerful tool for creating interactive mind maps in Flutter applications. Mind maps are visual representations of information that help in organizing thoughts, brainstorming ideas, and enhancing memory retention. This package allows developers to easily integrate mind mapping capabilities into their Flutter apps, making it ideal for educational tools, project management applications, and personal productivity apps.

## When to Use This Package
- **Educational Apps**: To help students visualize concepts and relationships between ideas.
- **Project Management**: For brainstorming sessions and organizing project tasks.
- **Personal Productivity**: To create to-do lists or plan personal projects visually.

## Features
- **Customizable Nodes**: Create nodes with different styles, colors, and shapes.
- **Interactive**: Users can interact with the mind map, adding or removing nodes dynamically.
- **Zoom and Pan**: Users can zoom in and out of the mind map and pan around to explore different sections.
- **Export Options**: Ability to export the mind map as an image or PDF for sharing.

The **mind_map** package is a versatile tool that can enhance user experience by providing a visual way to organize and present information.

# Tutorial: Setting Up the Mind Map Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To use the **mind_map** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  mind_map: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/mind_map).

## Step 2: Install Packages
Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Import the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:mind_map/mind_map.dart';
```

## Step 5: Basic Usage
You can now start using the **mind_map** package in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to create a basic mind map.

# Complete Example of Mind Map in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mind_map/mind_map.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Mind Map Example',
      home: MindMapScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class MindMapScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MindMapScreenState createState() => _MindMapScreenState();
}

class _MindMapScreenState extends State<MindMapScreen> {
  // Initialize the mind map data
  final List<MindMapNode> nodes = [
    MindMapNode(
      title: 'Main Idea',
      children: [
        MindMapNode(title: 'Sub Idea 1'),
        MindMapNode(title: 'Sub Idea 2', children: [
          MindMapNode(title: 'Sub Idea 2.1'),
          MindMapNode(title: 'Sub Idea 2.2'),
        ]),
      ],
    ),
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Mind Map Example'),
      ),
      body: MindMap(
        nodes: nodes,
        onNodeTap: (node) {
          // Handle node tap
          print('Tapped on: ${node.title}');
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home screen.
// 3. MindMapScreen is a StatefulWidget that manages the state of the mind map.
// 4. In the _MindMapScreenState, we define a list of MindMapNode objects to represent the structure of the mind map.
// 5. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a MindMap widget.
// 6. The MindMap widget takes the list of nodes and provides an onNodeTap callback to handle user interactions.
// 7. When a node is tapped, it prints the title of the tapped node to the console.
```
