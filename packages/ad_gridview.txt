      body: AdGridView(
        // Set the ad grid view controller
        controller: _adGridViewController,

        // Set the ad unit ID

        // Set the ad frequency
        adFrequency: _adFrequency,

        // Set the grid view children
        children: List.generate(100, (index) {
          return Card(
            child: Padding(
              padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
              child: Text('Item $index'),
            ),
          );
        }),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a grid view of items.
// 2. The ad grid view controller is initialized and set to the grid view.
// 3. The ad unit ID, ad format, ad placement, and ad frequency are set.
// 4. The grid view children are generated and set to the grid view.
// 5. The ad grid view controller loads the ads and displays them in the grid view according to the ad placement and frequency.
// 6. The user can scroll through the grid view and view the ads.
// 7. The ad grid view controller handles the ad clicks and displays the ad content.

// In summary, the ad grid view package provides a simple and effective way to integrate ads into a grid view in Flutter.
// The package handles the ad loading, placement, and frequency, making it easy to use and customize.
