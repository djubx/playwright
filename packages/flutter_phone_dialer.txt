            },
            child: Text('Call 1234567890'),

# Complete Example of Flutter Phone Dialer

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_phone_dialer/flutter_phone_dialer.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Phone Dialer Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initiate a phone call
              await FlutterPhoneDialer.startDialer(phoneNumber: '1234567890');
            },
            child: Text('Call 1234567890'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The MaterialApp widget is created, providing the basic structure of the app.
// 3. A Scaffold widget is used to create the app's visual structure, including an AppBar and a body.
// 4. In the body, a Center widget is used to center the content.
// 5. An ElevatedButton is created, which, when pressed, triggers the onPressed callback.
// 6. Inside the onPressed callback, the FlutterPhoneDialer.startDialer method is called with a phone number.
// 7. This method initiates a phone call to the specified number, allowing the user to connect directly.
