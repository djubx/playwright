# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the phone_sign_in Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the `phone_sign_in` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  phone_sign_in: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/phone_sign_in).

## Step 2: Configure Firebase
### For Android
1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Create a new project or select an existing one.
3. Add an Android app to your project and follow the instructions to download the `google-services.json` file.
4. Place the `google-services.json` file in the `android/app` directory.
5. Update your `android/build.gradle` file to include the Google services classpath:

```groovy
buildscript {
    dependencies {
        // Add this line
        classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.10'
    }
}
```

6. In your `android/app/build.gradle`, apply the Google services plugin:

```groovy
apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
```

### For iOS
1. In the Firebase Console, add an iOS app to your project.
2. Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file.
3. Place the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file in the `ios/Runner` directory.
4. Open your `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift` file and configure Firebase:

```swift
import UIKit
import Flutter
import Firebase

@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: FlutterAppDelegate {
  override func application(
    _ application: UIApplication,
    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?
  ) -> Bool {
    FirebaseApp.configure() // Initialize Firebase
    return super.application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: launchOptions)
  }
}
```

## Step 3: Implementing Phone Sign-In
Now that you have set up the package and Firebase, you can implement phone sign-in in your Flutter application. 

### Example Code
Refer to the complete example in the next section for a detailed implementation.

# Complete Example of phone_sign_in

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:phone_sign_in/phone_sign_in.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Phone Sign In Example',
      home: PhoneSignInScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PhoneSignInScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PhoneSignInScreenState createState() => _PhoneSignInScreenState();
}

class _PhoneSignInScreenState extends State<PhoneSignInScreen> {
  final TextEditingController _phoneController = TextEditingController();
  String _verificationId = '';
  String _message = '';

  // Function to initiate phone sign-in
  void _signInWithPhoneNumber() async {
    try {
      // Start the phone sign-in process
      await PhoneSignIn.signInWithPhoneNumber(
        phoneNumber: _phoneController.text,
        verificationCompleted: (PhoneAuthCredential credential) {
          // This callback is called when verification is completed automatically
          setState(() {
            _message = 'Verification completed: ${credential.smsCode}';
          });
        },
        verificationFailed: (FirebaseAuthException e) {
          // Handle verification failure
          setState(() {
            _message = 'Verification failed: ${e.message}';
          });
        },
        codeSent: (String verificationId, int? resendToken) {
          // This callback is called when the code is sent
          setState(() {
            _verificationId = verificationId;
            _message = 'Code sent to ${_phoneController.text}';
          });
        },
        codeAutoRetrievalTimeout: (String verificationId) {
          // This callback is called when the code auto-retrieval times out
          setState(() {
            _verificationId = verificationId;
            _message = 'Code auto-retrieval timed out';
          });
        },
      );
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during sign-in
      setState(() {
        _message = 'Error: $e';
      });
    }
  }

  // Function to verify the code entered by the user
  void _verifyCode(String smsCode) async {
    try {
      // Create a PhoneAuthCredential with the verification ID and SMS code
      PhoneAuthCredential credential = PhoneAuthProvider.credential(
        verificationId: _verificationId,
        smsCode: smsCode,
      );

      // Sign in the user with the credential
      await FirebaseAuth.instance.signInWithCredential(credential);
      setState(() {
        _message = 'Successfully signed in!';
      });
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        _message = 'Failed to sign in: $e';
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Phone Sign In')),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              controller: _phoneController,
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Phone Number'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _signInWithPhoneNumber,
              child: Text('Sign In'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(_message),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The PhoneSignInScreen widget is a stateful widget that manages the phone sign-in process.
// 4. The user enters their phone number in a TextField and presses the "Sign In" button.
// 5. The _signInWithPhoneNumber function is called, which initiates the phone sign-in process.
// 6. Depending on the outcome of the sign-in process, the appropriate message is displayed to the user.
// 7. If the code is sent, the user can enter the SMS code to verify their phone number.
// 8. The _verifyCode function handles the verification of the entered SMS code and signs in the user.
