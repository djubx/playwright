// The app starts by displaying a text field where the user can enter a search query.
// As the user types, the app calls the _getSuggestions function to get a list of autocomplete suggestions from the Google Places API.
// The suggestions are then displayed in a list view below the text field.
// When the user taps on a suggestion, the app calls the _getPlace function to get the details of the selected place from the Google Places API.
// The place details are then displayed at the bottom of the screen.
// The app uses the GooglePlaces class from the google_places_for_flutter_3 package to interact with the Google Places API.
