Here's a detailed technical blog on the "pattern_formatter" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Pattern Formatter Flutter Package

The **pattern_formatter** package is a powerful tool for formatting input fields in Flutter applications. It allows developers to define specific patterns for user input, ensuring that data is entered in a consistent and valid format. This is particularly useful for fields like phone numbers, credit card numbers, dates, and other structured data.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the **pattern_formatter** package when:
- You need to enforce a specific input format for user data.
- You want to improve user experience by providing real-time feedback on input validity.
- You are developing forms that require structured data entry, such as registration forms, payment forms, or any other data collection forms.

## Features

- **Customizable Patterns**: Define your own input patterns to match specific requirements.
- **Real-time Formatting**: Automatically formats the input as the user types.
- **Validation**: Ensures that the input adheres to the specified pattern, providing immediate feedback.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.

By leveraging the **pattern_formatter** package, developers can create more user-friendly and robust applications that handle user input effectively.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Pattern Formatter

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **pattern_formatter** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  pattern_formatter: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:pattern_formatter/pattern_formatter.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Package in Your Application

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file, depending on your use case. For example, if you are using the package for formatting phone numbers, you might want to add:

```xml
<key>NSContactsUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to contacts for formatting phone numbers.</string>
```

## Step 4: Implementing the Formatter

You can now use the `PatternFormatter` in your input fields. Hereâ€™s an example of how to format a phone number:

```dart
TextField(
  keyboardType: TextInputType.phone,
  inputFormatters: [
    PatternFormatter("(###) ###-####"), // Format for US phone numbers
  ],
  decoration: InputDecoration(
    labelText: "Phone Number",
    hintText: "(123) 456-7890",
  ),
)
```

This will format the input as the user types, ensuring that it matches the specified pattern.

# Complete Example of Using Pattern Formatter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pattern_formatter/pattern_formatter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Pattern Formatter Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Pattern Formatter Example'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Column(
            children: [
              // TextField for phone number input
              TextField(
                keyboardType: TextInputType.phone,
                inputFormatters: [
                  PatternFormatter("(###) ###-####"), // Format for US phone numbers
                ],
                decoration: InputDecoration(
                  labelText: "Phone Number",
                  hintText: "(123) 456-7890",
                ),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // TextField for credit card input
              TextField(
                keyboardType: TextInputType.number,
                inputFormatters: [
                  PatternFormatter("#### #### #### ####"), // Format for credit card numbers
                ],
                decoration: InputDecoration(
                  labelText: "Credit Card Number",
                  hintText: "1234 5678 9012 3456",
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title "Pattern Formatter Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Padding widget to provide spacing around the content.
// 5. A Column widget is used to arrange the input fields vertically.
// 6. The first TextField is for phone number input, formatted to match the pattern (###) ###-####.
// 7. The second TextField is for credit card input, formatted to match the pattern #### #### #### ####.
// 8. As the user types in either field, the input is automatically formatted according to the specified pattern.
```
