# Complete Example of flutter_richtext_composer

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_richtext_composer/flutter_richtext_composer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Rich Text Composer Example',
      home: RichTextEditor(),
    );
  }
}

class RichTextEditor extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RichTextEditorState createState() => _RichTextEditorState();
}

class _RichTextEditorState extends State<RichTextEditor> {
  String _formattedText = '';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Rich Text Composer'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // RichTextComposer widget for text input
          RichTextComposer(
            onTextChanged: (text) {
              // Update the formatted text whenever the user types
              setState(() {
                _formattedText = text;
              });
            },
          ),
          // Display the formatted text below the composer
          Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
            child: Text(
              _formattedText,
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home widget.
// 3. The RichTextEditor is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the formatted text.
// 4. Inside the RichTextEditor, we use the RichTextComposer widget to allow users to input rich text.
// 5. The onTextChanged callback updates the _formattedText state variable whenever the user types.
// 6. The formatted text is displayed below the composer in a Text widget, allowing users to see their input in real-time.
