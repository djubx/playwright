# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_progress_status

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_progress_status` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_progress_status: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a progress indicator using the `flutter_progress_status` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_progress_status/flutter_progress_status.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Progress Status Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ProgressStatus(
            status: ProgressStatusType.loading, // Set the status to loading
            color: Colors.blue, // Customize the color
            size: 100.0, // Set the size of the progress indicator
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays a loading progress indicator in the center of the screen.

# Complete Example of flutter_progress_status

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_progress_status/flutter_progress_status.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to track the progress status
  ProgressStatusType _status = ProgressStatusType.loading;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Simulate a network call or long-running task
    _simulateLoading();
  }

  // Function to simulate loading
  void _simulateLoading() async {
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3)); // Simulate a delay
    setState(() {
      _status = ProgressStatusType.completed; // Update status to completed
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Progress Status Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ProgressStatus(
            status: _status, // Use the current status
            color: Colors.blue, // Customize the color
            size: 100.0, // Set the size of the progress indicator
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatefulWidget that manages its state.
// 3. In the initState method, we call _simulateLoading to start a simulated loading process.
// 4. The _simulateLoading function waits for 3 seconds to mimic a network call.
// 5. After the delay, it updates the state to change the progress status to completed.
// 6. The build method returns a MaterialApp with a ProgressStatus widget in the center.
// 7. The ProgressStatus widget displays a loading indicator initially, which changes to completed after 3 seconds.
```
