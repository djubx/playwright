### Tutorial

#### Installation

To get started with the `responsive_s` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  responsive_s: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

#### Platform-Specific Details

The `responsive_s` package works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms. However, ensure that your Flutter environment is set up correctly for both platforms. You may need to configure your Android and iOS projects to support the latest Flutter features.

- **Android**: Ensure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
- **iOS**: Make sure your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`.

#### Basic Usage

To use the `responsive_s` package, you need to wrap your main widget with `Responsive` widget provided by the package. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:responsive_s/responsive_s.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Responsive(
        child: Scaffold(
          appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Responsive App')),
          body: Center(child: Text('Hello, Responsive World!')),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `Responsive` widget automatically adjusts the layout based on the screen size.

### Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:responsive_s/responsive_s.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Responsive(
        // The Responsive widget wraps the entire app to provide responsive capabilities
        child: Scaffold(
          appBar: AppBar(
            title: Text('Responsive Layout Example'),
          ),
          body: Column(
            // Using a Column to stack widgets vertically
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Responsive Text Widget
              ResponsiveText(
                'Welcome to Responsive_s!',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between widgets
              // Responsive Container
              ResponsiveContainer(
                width: 80, // Width will be 80% of the screen width
                height: 200,
                color: Colors.blue,
                child: Center(
                  child: Text(
                    'I am responsive!',
                    style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 18),
                  ),
                ),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Another Responsive Container
              ResponsiveContainer(
                width: 50, // Width will be 50% of the screen width
                height: 100,
                color: Colors.green,
                child: Center(
                  child: Text(
                    'Resize me!',
                    style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 18),
                  ),
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body consists of a Column that centers its children vertically.
// 5. The first child is a ResponsiveText widget that adjusts its size based on the screen.
// 6. The second child is a ResponsiveContainer that takes 80% of the screen width and displays a message.
// 7. The third child is another ResponsiveContainer that takes 50% of the screen width, demonstrating how the layout adapts to different screen sizes.
