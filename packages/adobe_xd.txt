```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:adobe_xd/adobe_xd.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return AdobeXD(
      design: 'path/to/design.xd',
      child: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Step 1: Get the Adobe XD design
    final design = AdobeXD.of(context).design;

    // Step 2: Get the layout from the design
    final layout = design.getLayout('layout_name');

    // Step 3: Create a Flutter widget from the layout
    final widget = layout.toWidget();

    // Step 4: Return the widget
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Adobe XD Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: widget,
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application flow:
// 1. The app starts and initializes the Adobe XD package.
// 2. The Adobe XD package loads the design from the specified path.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget gets the design and layout from the Adobe XD package.
// 4. The RealFlutter widget creates a Flutter widget from the layout.
// 5. The RealFlutter widget returns the widget, which is displayed on the screen.

// Summary: The code flows by initializing the Adobe XD package, loading the design, getting the layout, creating a Flutter widget, and displaying it on the screen.
