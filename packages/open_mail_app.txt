# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Open Mail App Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `open_mail_app` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  open_mail_app: ^0.5.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permission:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to ensure that your app has the appropriate permissions set in the `Info.plist` file. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
    <string>mailto</string>
</array>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to open the default email app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:open_mail_app/open_mail_app.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Open Mail App Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Attempt to open the mail app
              final result = await OpenMailApp.openMailApp();
              // Check if the mail app was opened successfully
              if (!result.didOpen && !result.canOpen) {
                // Show a message if no email app is available
                print("No email app found");
              }
            },
            child: Text('Open Email App'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, the app attempts to open the default email application. If no email app is found, it prints a message to the console.

# Complete Example of Open Mail App

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:open_mail_app/open_mail_app.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Open Mail App Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Attempt to open the mail app
              final result = await OpenMailApp.openMailApp();
              // Check if the mail app was opened successfully
              if (!result.didOpen && !result.canOpen) {
                // Show a message if no email app is available
                print("No email app found");
              }
            },
            child: Text('Open Email App'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The MaterialApp widget is created, providing the app's structure.
// 3. A Scaffold widget is used to create the basic visual layout, including an AppBar and a body.
// 4. In the body, a Center widget is used to center the content.
// 5. An ElevatedButton is created, which, when pressed, triggers the onPressed callback.
// 6. Inside the onPressed callback, the OpenMailApp.openMailApp() method is called to attempt to open the default email application.
// 7. The result of the attempt is checked. If the email app did not open and cannot be opened, a message is printed to the console indicating that no email app is found.
