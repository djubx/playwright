<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Dropdown Search Flutter Package

The `dropdown_search` package is a powerful and flexible solution for implementing dropdown search functionality in Flutter applications. It allows users to search through a list of items in a dropdown menu, making it easier to find specific options, especially when dealing with large datasets. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where the user needs to select from a long list of items, such as selecting a country, city, or any other category.

## When to Use This Package
- **Large Data Sets**: When you have a long list of items that users need to search through.
- **Dynamic Data**: When the list of items is fetched from an API or database and can change frequently.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: To provide a more interactive and user-friendly way to select options.

## Features
- **Searchable Dropdown**: Users can type to filter options in the dropdown.
- **Customizable UI**: You can customize the appearance of the dropdown and its items.
- **Multiple Selection**: Support for selecting multiple items if needed.
- **Asynchronous Loading**: Load data asynchronously, which is useful for fetching data from APIs.

Overall, the `dropdown_search` package enhances the user experience by making it easier to find and select items from a dropdown list.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Dropdown Search

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the `dropdown_search` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  dropdown_search: ^2.0.0
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Basic Setup
In your Flutter project, you can start using the `dropdown_search` widget. Here’s a simple example of how to set it up:

### Import the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:dropdown_search/dropdown_search.dart';
```

### Using the Widget
You can use the `DropdownSearch` widget in your widget tree. Here’s a basic example:

```dart
DropdownSearch<String>(
  mode: Mode.MENU,
  showSelectedItems: true,
  items: ["Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3"],
  label: "Select an Option",
  onChanged: (value) {
    print(value);
  },
  selectedItem: "Option 1",
)
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` if you are fetching data from the internet. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Customization
You can customize the dropdown by providing your own item builder, changing the dropdown's appearance, and more. For example:

```dart
DropdownSearch<String>(
  mode: Mode.MENU,
  items: ["Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3"],
  itemAsString: (String? item) => item!,
  dropdownBuilder: (context, selectedItem) => Text(selectedItem ?? "Select an Option"),
  onChanged: (value) {
    print(value);
  },
)
```

This allows you to create a more tailored user experience.

# Complete Example of Dropdown Search

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dropdown_search/dropdown_search.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dropdown Search Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Dropdown Search Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: DropdownSearchExample(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DropdownSearchExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return DropdownSearch<String>(
      mode: Mode.MENU, // Set the mode to MENU for dropdown
      showSelectedItems: true, // Show selected items
      items: ["Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3", "Option 4", "Option 5"], // List of items
      label: "Select an Option", // Label for the dropdown
      onChanged: (value) {
        // Callback when an item is selected
        print("Selected: $value");
      },
      selectedItem: "Option 1", // Default selected item
      dropdownBuilder: (context, selectedItem) => 
          Text(selectedItem ?? "Select an Option"), // Custom dropdown builder
      popupItemBuilder: (context, item, isSelected) => 
          ListTile(title: Text(item)), // Custom popup item builder
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a body with the DropdownSearchExample widget.
// 4. DropdownSearchExample builds a DropdownSearch widget with a list of options.
// 5. When an option is selected, the onChanged callback is triggered, printing the selected value.
// 6. The dropdown displays the selected item and allows users to search through the options.
```
