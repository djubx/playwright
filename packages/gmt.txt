# Overview of the "gmt" Flutter Package

The "gmt" package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that simplifies the handling of time zones and date-time conversions. It is particularly useful when building applications that require accurate time representation across different geographical locations. This package is ideal for applications that involve scheduling, event planning, or any functionality that relies on precise time management.

## Key Features
- **Time Zone Support**: Easily convert between different time zones.
- **Date-Time Manipulation**: Perform various operations on date and time, such as adding or subtracting time.
- **Formatting Options**: Format date and time in various styles to suit your application's needs.
- **Localization**: Support for multiple languages and formats, making it suitable for global applications.

## When to Use
You should consider using the "gmt" package when:
- Your application needs to display time in different time zones.
- You are working on a scheduling app that requires accurate time management.
- You need to manipulate date and time for features like reminders or notifications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the "gmt" Package

## Installation
To get started with the "gmt" package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  gmt: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` to allow for background processing if your app requires it. Add the following key:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>fetch</string>
</array>
```

## Basic Usage
Once the package is installed and configured, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to convert a date-time from one time zone to another:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gmt/gmt.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: TimeZoneExample(),
    );
  }
}

class TimeZoneExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Get the current time in UTC
    DateTime nowUtc = DateTime.now().toUtc();
    
    // Convert UTC time to a specific time zone (e.g., New York)
    DateTime newYorkTime = Gmt.convert(nowUtc, 'America/New_York');

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('GMT Package Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Current time in New York: $newYorkTime'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to convert the current UTC time to New York time using the "gmt" package.

# Complete Example of Using the "gmt" Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gmt/gmt.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: TimeZoneExample(),
    );
  }
}

class TimeZoneExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Get the current time in UTC
    DateTime nowUtc = DateTime.now().toUtc();
    
    // Convert UTC time to a specific time zone (e.g., New York)
    DateTime newYorkTime = Gmt.convert(nowUtc, 'America/New_York');
    
    // Convert UTC time to another time zone (e.g., London)
    DateTime londonTime = Gmt.convert(nowUtc, 'Europe/London');

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('GMT Package Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Current time in UTC: $nowUtc'),
            Text('Current time in New York: $newYorkTime'),
            Text('Current time in London: $londonTime'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with TimeZoneExample as the home widget.
// 3. In TimeZoneExample, the current UTC time is fetched using DateTime.now().toUtc().
// 4. The UTC time is then converted to New York and London time using the Gmt.convert method.
// 5. The Scaffold widget displays the current time in UTC, New York, and London in a column format.
