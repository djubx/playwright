# Cached Firestorage: Efficient Image Caching for Flutter

The `cached_firestorage` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to optimize the loading and caching of images stored in Firebase Storage. This package provides a seamless way to fetch images from Firebase while ensuring that they are cached locally, reducing load times and improving the user experience.

## When to Use This Package
- **Image-heavy Applications**: If your app displays a lot of images from Firebase, using this package can significantly enhance performance.
- **Offline Support**: It allows users to view previously loaded images even when they are offline.
- **Dynamic Content**: Ideal for applications that frequently update images, as it handles caching intelligently.

## Features
- **Automatic Caching**: Automatically caches images fetched from Firebase Storage.
- **Efficient Memory Management**: Manages memory usage effectively to prevent crashes on low-end devices.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that integrates seamlessly with existing Flutter applications.
- **Customizable Cache Duration**: Allows developers to set how long images should be cached.

Overall, `cached_firestorage` is an essential package for any Flutter developer working with Firebase Storage who wants to enhance the performance and user experience of their applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Cached Firestorage

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started with `cached_firestorage`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cached_firestorage: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following permissions:
   ```xml
   <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your photo library to save images.</string>
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to fetch and display an image from Firebase Storage using `cached_firestorage`.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cached_firestorage/cached_firestorage.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  final String imageUrl = 'https://your-firebase-storage-url/image.png';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Cached Firestorage Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: CachedFirestorageImage(
            imageUrl: imageUrl,
            placeholder: CircularProgressIndicator(), // Placeholder while loading
            errorWidget: Icon(Icons.error), // Widget to show on error
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

This code demonstrates how to use the `CachedFirestorageImage` widget to display an image from Firebase Storage with a loading indicator and error handling.

# Complete Example of Cached Firestorage

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cached_firestorage/cached_firestorage.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  // URL of the image stored in Firebase Storage
  final String imageUrl = 'https://your-firebase-storage-url/image.png';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Cached Firestorage Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Using CachedFirestorageImage to display the image
          child: CachedFirestorageImage(
            imageUrl: imageUrl,
            placeholder: CircularProgressIndicator(), // Shows while the image is loading
            errorWidget: Icon(Icons.error), // Displays if there's an error loading the image
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title "Cached Firestorage Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 5. The child is a CachedFirestorageImage widget, which takes the image URL from Firebase Storage.
// 6. While the image is loading, a CircularProgressIndicator is displayed as a placeholder.
// 7. If the image fails to load, an error icon is shown.
// 8. This setup ensures that images are cached, improving performance and user experience.
