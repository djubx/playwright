# iaphub_flutter Setup and Usage Tutorial

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `iaphub_flutter` package and explain how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Installation

To get started, add the `iaphub_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml

```

Then, run the following command to install the package:

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file to enable in-app purchases:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
<key>SKAdNetworkItems</key>
<array>
    <dict>
        <key>SKAdNetworkIdentifier</key>
        <string>your_skadnetwork_id</string>
    </dict>
</array>
```

2. **Enable In-App Purchases**: Ensure that your app's capabilities include In-App Purchases in Xcode.

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="com.android.vending.BILLING" />
```

2. **Google Play Console**: Make sure to set up your in-app products in the Google Play Console.

## Basic Usage

To use the `iaphub_flutter` package, you need to initialize it with your Iaphub API key and set up the necessary methods for handling purchases.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:iaphub_flutter/iaphub_flutter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize Iaphub with your API key
    Iaphub.init('your_api_key');
  }

  // Method to fetch products
  void fetchProducts() async {
    // Fetch available products from Iaphub
    final products = await Iaphub.getProducts();
    // Handle the fetched products
  }

  // Method to make a purchase
  void purchaseProduct(String productId) async {
    // Initiate a purchase for the specified product
    final result = await Iaphub.purchase(productId);
    // Handle the purchase result
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Iaphub Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            fetchProducts(); // Fetch products when button is pressed
          },
          child: Text('Fetch Products'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of iaphub_flutter

Here is a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the `iaphub_flutter` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:iaphub_flutter/iaphub_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  List<Product> products = []; // List to hold fetched products

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize Iaphub with your API key
    Iaphub.init('your_api_key');
    fetchProducts(); // Fetch products on app start
  }

  // Method to fetch products
  void fetchProducts() async {
    // Fetch available products from Iaphub
    final fetchedProducts = await Iaphub.getProducts();
    setState(() {
      products = fetchedProducts; // Update state with fetched products
    });
  }

  // Method to make a purchase
  void purchaseProduct(String productId) async {
    // Initiate a purchase for the specified product
    final result = await Iaphub.purchase(productId);
    // Handle the purchase result
    if (result.success) {
      // Purchase was successful
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Purchase successful!')),
      );
    } else {
      // Handle purchase failure
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Purchase failed: ${result.error}')),
      );
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Iaphub Example')),
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: products.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          final product = products[index];
          return ListTile(
            title: Text(product.name), // Display product name
            subtitle: Text(product.price), // Display product price
            trailing: ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () => purchaseProduct(product.id), // Purchase on button press
              child: Text('Buy'),
            ),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and initializes the Iaphub service with the provided API key.
// 2. It fetches the available products from Iaphub and updates the state.
// 3. The products are displayed in a ListView, showing their names and prices.
// 4. When the user clicks the "Buy" button, the purchaseProduct method is called.
// 5. The purchase result is handled, displaying a success or failure message accordingly.
