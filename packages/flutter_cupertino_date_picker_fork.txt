# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_cupertino_date_picker_fork

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_cupertino_date_picker_fork` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_cupertino_date_picker_fork` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_cupertino_date_picker_fork: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the date picker, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_cupertino_date_picker_fork/flutter_cupertino_date_picker_fork.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Date Picker

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, ensure that your app's `Info.plist` file includes the necessary permissions for date and time access if required. However, the date picker itself does not require special permissions.

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file is set up correctly. The default configuration should suffice for using the date picker.

### Example Usage

Here’s a simple example of how to implement the date picker in your application:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_cupertino_date_picker_fork/flutter_cupertino_date_picker_fork.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Date Picker Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Show the date picker when the button is pressed
              DatePicker.showDatePicker(
                context,
                onConfirm: (date) {
                  // Handle the selected date
                  print("Selected date: $date");
                },
              );
            },
            child: Text('Select Date'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the user taps the "Select Date" button, the date picker will appear, allowing them to choose a date. The selected date will be printed to the console.

// 6. The DatePicker.showDatePicker method is called, displaying the date picker.
// 7. The initial date is set to the current date, and a date format is specified.
// 8. When the user confirms a date, the selected date is printed to the console.
