# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Interactive Box Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **interactive_box** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  interactive_box: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:interactive_box/interactive_box.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Interactive Box

You can now use the **interactive_box** in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create an interactive box that responds to user taps.

```dart
InteractiveBox(
  onTap: () {
    // Handle tap event
  },
  child: Container(
    color: Colors.blue,
    height: 100,
    width: 100,
    child: Center(child: Text('Tap Me')),
  ),
);
```

This code creates a blue box that responds to tap events. You can customize the child widget and the onTap behavior as needed.

# Complete Example of Using the Interactive Box Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:interactive_box/interactive_box.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Interactive Box Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Interactive Box Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: InteractiveBox(
            onTap: () {
              // This function is called when the box is tapped
              print('Box tapped!');
            },
            child: Container(
              color: Colors.blue,
              height: 100,
              width: 100,
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'Tap Me',
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Interactive Box Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers an InteractiveBox widget.
// 5. The InteractiveBox has an onTap callback that prints 'Box tapped!' to the console when the box is tapped.
// 6. Inside the InteractiveBox, a Container is defined with a blue background, height, width, and centered text 'Tap Me'.
// 7. When the user taps the blue box, the onTap function is triggered, demonstrating the interactive feature of the package.
