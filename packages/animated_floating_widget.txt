```

### Step 3: Create an instance of the AnimatedFloatingWidget class

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: Center(
        child: AnimatedFloatingWidget(
          // Your widget here
          child: Container(
            width: 100,
            height: 100,
            color: Colors.red,
          ),

      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Platform-Specific Details

*   Android: No additional configuration is required.
*   iOS: No additional configuration is required.

### Required Configurations or Optimizations

*   You can customize the animation and appearance of the floating widget by using the various properties provided by the `AnimatedFloatingWidget` class.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_floating_widget/animated_floating_widget.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animated Floating Widget Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a Scaffold to provide a basic material design visual layout structure
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Animated Floating Widget Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        // Create an instance of the AnimatedFloatingWidget class
        child: AnimatedFloatingWidget(
          // Define the child widget that will be displayed
          child: Container(
            width: 100,
            height: 100,
            color: Colors.red,
          ),
          // Define the animation duration
          animationDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 500),
          // Define the animation curve
          animationCurve: Curves.easeInOut,
          // Define the padding around the child widget
          padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and the RealFlutter widget is displayed.
// 2. The AnimatedFloatingWidget is created and displayed in the center of the screen.
// 3. The animation is triggered and the child widget is displayed with the defined animation.
// 4. The user can interact with the child widget as needed.
// 5. The animation is reversed when the user navigates away from the screen.

// Final summary: The code creates a basic material design visual layout structure using the Scaffold class, and then creates an instance of the AnimatedFloatingWidget class to display a child widget with animation. The animation is customized using various properties provided by the AnimatedFloatingWidget class.
