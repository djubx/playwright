# jh_debug Flutter Package

The `jh_debug` package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers to facilitate debugging and logging within their applications. It provides a simple and effective way to track application behavior, log messages, and visualize debug information, making it easier to identify issues during development.

## When to Use jh_debug

- **Debugging**: When you need to track down bugs or unexpected behavior in your Flutter application.
- **Logging**: To log important events or errors that occur during runtime.
- **Development**: When you want to visualize the flow of your application and understand how data is being processed.

## Key Features

- **Customizable Logging**: Easily configure logging levels and formats.
- **Visual Debugging**: Provides a user-friendly interface to view logs and debug information.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track performance metrics to identify bottlenecks in your application.
- **Error Tracking**: Automatically log errors and exceptions for easier troubleshooting.

Overall, `jh_debug` is an essential package for any Flutter developer looking to enhance their debugging capabilities and improve application reliability.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using jh_debug

## Installation

To add the `jh_debug` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  jh_debug: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/jh_debug).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file, depending on the features you plan to use. For example, if you are logging network requests, you might need to add:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage

To use `jh_debug`, you need to initialize it in your main application file. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:jh_debug/jh_debug.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize jh_debug
  JHDebug.init();
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'jh_debug Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('jh_debug Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Log a message when the button is pressed
              JHDebug.log('Button Pressed!');
            },
            child: Text('Press Me'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize `jh_debug` in the `main` function and log a message when the button is pressed. You can explore more features as you integrate the package into your application.

# Complete Example of jh_debug in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:jh_debug/jh_debug.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize jh_debug for logging and debugging
  JHDebug.init();
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'jh_debug Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('jh_debug Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Log a message when the button is pressed
              JHDebug.log('Button Pressed!');
            },
            child: Text('Press Me'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the jh_debug package by calling JHDebug.init().
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is run as the main application widget.
// 3. The MaterialApp widget sets up the app's title and home screen.
// 4. A Scaffold widget is used to create the basic visual structure of the app.
// 5. An AppBar is created with the title 'jh_debug Example'.
// 6. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 7. An ElevatedButton is displayed with the text 'Press Me'.
// 8. When the button is pressed, a log message 'Button Pressed!' is sent to jh_debug.
// 9. This log can be viewed in the jh_debug interface, helping developers track button interactions.
