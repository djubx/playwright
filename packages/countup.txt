# Countup Flutter Package

The **Countup** package for Flutter is a simple yet powerful tool designed to create animated countdowns and count-ups in your applications. This package is particularly useful for applications that require timers, such as games, event countdowns, or any scenario where you want to display a dynamic number that changes over time.

## Features
- **Customizable Duration**: You can set the duration for the count-up or countdown.
- **Animation Control**: The package provides options to control the animation speed and style.
- **Easy Integration**: It can be easily integrated into any Flutter application with minimal setup.
- **Flexible Display**: You can customize how the numbers are displayed, including formatting options.

## When to Use
- **Event Timers**: For applications that need to show the time remaining until an event.
- **Game Applications**: To display scores or time elapsed in games.
- **Progress Indicators**: For showing progress in tasks or processes.

The Countup package is a great choice for developers looking to add dynamic number displays to their Flutter applications with ease.

# Tutorial: Setting Up the Countup Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To use the Countup package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  countup: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install the Package
Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Import the Package
In your Dart file, import the Countup package:

```dart
import 'package:countup/countup.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Countup Widget
You can now use the Countup widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
Countup(
  begin: 0,
  end: 100,
  duration: Duration(seconds: 5),
  separator: ',',
  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 40, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
)
```

This code will create a count-up animation from 0 to 100 over 5 seconds, with a comma as a separator for thousands.

## Conclusion
With these steps, you can easily integrate the Countup package into your Flutter application. Customize the parameters to fit your needs, and enjoy the dynamic number displays!

# Complete Example of Countup Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:countup/countup.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Countup Example',
      home: CountupPage(),
    );
  }
}

class CountupPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CountupPageState createState() => _CountupPageState();
}

class _CountupPageState extends State<CountupPage> {
  // This variable will hold the end value for the countup
  final int endValue = 1000;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Countup Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Countup(
          begin: 0, // Starting value of the countup
          end: endValue, // Ending value of the countup
          duration: Duration(seconds: 10), // Duration of the countup
          separator: ',', // Separator for thousands
          style: TextStyle(
            fontSize: 50, // Font size of the displayed number
            fontWeight: FontWeight.bold, // Font weight
            color: Colors.blue, // Color of the text
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home page (CountupPage).
// 3. CountupPage is a StatefulWidget that manages its state.
// 4. In the build method of CountupPage, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, the Countup widget is used to display a count from 0 to 1000 over 10 seconds.
// 6. The Countup widget takes parameters for the beginning and ending values, duration, separator, and text style.
// 7. The countup animation will start automatically when the widget is built.
```
