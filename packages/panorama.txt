# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Panorama Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the panorama package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  panorama: ^0.6.0
```

Then, run the following command to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to configure the `Info.plist` file to allow for network access if you are loading images from the internet. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Panorama Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the panorama view.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:panorama/panorama.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Panorama Example',
      home: PanoramaExample(),
    );
  }
}

class PanoramaExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Panorama Example'),
      ),
      body: Panorama(
        child: Image.network('https://example.com/your-panorama-image.jpg'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that displays a panoramic image. The `Panorama` widget wraps an `Image` widget, allowing users to interact with the image.

# Complete Example of the Panorama Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart'; // Importing Flutter material package for UI components
import 'package:panorama/panorama.dart'; // Importing the panorama package for panoramic views

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp()); // Running the main application
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Panorama Example', // Title of the application
      home: PanoramaExample(), // Setting the home widget to PanoramaExample
    );
  }
}

class PanoramaExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Panorama Example'), // Title displayed in the app bar
      ),
      body: Panorama(
        // The Panorama widget allows for 360-degree image viewing
        child: Image.network('https://example.com/your-panorama-image.jpg'), // Replace with your image URL
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application, which calls runApp() to start the app.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp, setting the title and home widget.
// 3. The home widget is PanoramaExample, which builds a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains the Panorama widget, which wraps an Image widget.
// 5. The Image widget loads a panoramic image from the provided URL, allowing users to interact with it.
// 6. Users can swipe to look around the image, creating an immersive experience.
```
