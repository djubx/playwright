# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Floating Action Bubble Custom

## Installation
To use the `floating_action_bubble_custom` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  floating_action_bubble_custom: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package
To use the `floating_action_bubble_custom` package, you will need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:floating_action_bubble_custom/floating_action_bubble_custom.dart';
```

You can then create a `FloatingActionBubble` widget in your widget tree. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
FloatingActionBubble(
  backGroundColor: Colors.blue,
  iconData: Icons.add,
  items: <Bubble>[
    Bubble(
      title: "Action 1",
      iconColor: Colors.white,
      bubbleColor: Colors.blue,
      icon: Icons.access_alarm,
      onPress: () => print("Action 1 pressed"),
    ),
    Bubble(
      title: "Action 2",
      iconColor: Colors.white,
      bubbleColor: Colors.blue,
      icon: Icons.accessibility,
      onPress: () => print("Action 2 pressed"),
    ),
  ],
)
```

This code snippet creates a floating action button that expands into two options when pressed. Each option can have its own action defined in the `onPress` callback.

With this setup, you are ready to start using the `floating_action_bubble_custom` package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Floating Action Bubble Custom

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:floating_action_bubble_custom/floating_action_bubble_custom.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Floating Action Bubble Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  // Variable to control the visibility of the bubble menu
  bool _isBubbleVisible = false;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Floating Action Bubble Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Press the button below to see the bubble menu!'),
      ),
      // Floating Action Bubble widget
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionBubble(
        backGroundColor: Colors.blue,
        iconData: Icons.add,
        // Control the visibility of the bubble menu
        onPress: () {
          setState(() {
            _isBubbleVisible = !_isBubbleVisible; // Toggle visibility
          });
        },
        items: <Bubble>[
          Bubble(
            title: "Action 1",
            iconColor: Colors.white,
            bubbleColor: Colors.blue,
            icon: Icons.access_alarm,
            onPress: () {
              print("Action 1 pressed");
              // Close the bubble menu after action
              setState(() {
                _isBubbleVisible = false;
              });
            },
          ),
          Bubble(
            title: "Action 2",
            iconColor: Colors.white,
            bubbleColor: Colors.blue,
            icon: Icons.accessibility,
            onPress: () {
              print("Action 2 pressed");
              // Close the bubble menu after action
              setState(() {
                _isBubbleVisible = false;
              });
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a HomeScreen as the home widget.
// 3. HomeScreen contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget displaying a message.
// 4. The FloatingActionBubble widget is added as a floating action button.
// 5. Tapping the FAB toggles the visibility of the bubble menu.
// 6. Each bubble has an onPress action that prints a message and closes the menu.
// 7. The app is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, providing a smooth user experience.
