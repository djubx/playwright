# Setting Up the Flutter OSM Plugin

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_osm_plugin` and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_osm_plugin` dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_osm_plugin: ^0.14.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/>
   ```

2. **Google Maps API Key**: If you plan to use Google Maps as a fallback, ensure you have a valid API key and include it in your manifest.

### iOS Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys:

   ```xml
   <key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need your location to show it on the map.</string>
   <key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need your location to show it on the map.</string>
   ```

2. **Enable Location Services**: Ensure that location services are enabled in your app settings.

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your Flutter application.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_osm_plugin/flutter_osm_plugin.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text("OSM Plugin Example")),
        body: OSMMap(
          controller: MapController(),
          onMapCreated: (controller) {
            // Add a marker at a specific location
            controller.addMarker(
              GeoPoint(latitude: 37.7749, longitude: -122.4194), // San Francisco
              icon: MarkerIcon(
                icon: Icon(Icons.location_on, color: Colors.red, size: 48),
              ),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays a map centered on San Francisco with a marker.

# Complete Example of Using the Flutter OSM Plugin

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_osm_plugin/flutter_osm_plugin.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text("OSM Plugin Example")),
        body: OSMMap(
          controller: MapController(), // Initialize the map controller
          onMapCreated: (controller) {
            // Add a marker at a specific location
            controller.addMarker(
              GeoPoint(latitude: 37.7749, longitude: -122.4194), // San Francisco
              icon: MarkerIcon(
                icon: Icon(Icons.location_on, color: Colors.red, size: 48), // Custom marker icon
              ),
            );
          },
          onLocationChanged: (location) {
            // Handle location changes
            print("User location: ${location.latitude}, ${location.longitude}");
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a body.
// 3. The body contains an OSMMap widget, which initializes the map.
// 4. The onMapCreated callback is triggered when the map is ready, allowing us to add markers.
// 5. A marker is added at the coordinates for San Francisco, using a custom icon.
// 6. The onLocationChanged callback prints the user's current location to the console whenever it changes.
```
