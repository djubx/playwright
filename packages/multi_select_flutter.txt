# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Multi Select Flutter

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `multi_select_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  multi_select_flutter: ^4.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a multi-select dropdown.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:multi_select_flutter/multi_select_flutter.dart';
```

2. Create a list of items that you want to display in the multi-select dropdown:

```dart
final List<MultiSelectItem<String>> _items = [
  MultiSelectItem('item1', 'Item 1'),
  MultiSelectItem('item2', 'Item 2'),
  MultiSelectItem('item3', 'Item 3'),
];
```

3. Use the `MultiSelectDialogField` widget to create the multi-select dropdown:

```dart
MultiSelectDialogField(
  items: _items,
  title: Text("Select Items"),
  selectedColor: Colors.blue,
  decoration: BoxDecoration(
    border: Border.all(color: Colors.blueAccent),
    borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(5),
  ),
  onConfirm: (results) {
    // Handle the selected items
    print(results);
  },
)
```

This will create a multi-select dropdown that allows users to select multiple items from the list.

## Conclusion

The `multi_select_flutter` package is a versatile tool for implementing multi-select functionality in Flutter applications. With its customizable UI and ease of use, it can significantly enhance user experience in scenarios requiring multiple selections.

# Complete Example of Multi Select Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:multi_select_flutter/multi_select_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Multi Select Flutter Example',
      home: MultiSelectExample(),
    );
  }
}

class MultiSelectExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MultiSelectExampleState createState() => _MultiSelectExampleState();
}

class _MultiSelectExampleState extends State<MultiSelectExample> {
  // List of items to be displayed in the multi-select dropdown
  final List<MultiSelectItem<String>> _items = [
    MultiSelectItem('item1', 'Item 1'),
    MultiSelectItem('item2', 'Item 2'),
    MultiSelectItem('item3', 'Item 3'),
    MultiSelectItem('item4', 'Item 4'),
  ];

  // Variable to hold the selected items
  List<String> _selectedItems = [];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Multi Select Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // MultiSelectDialogField widget for selecting multiple items
            MultiSelectDialogField(
              items: _items,
              title: Text("Select Items"),
              selectedColor: Colors.blue,
              decoration: BoxDecoration(
                border: Border.all(color: Colors.blueAccent),
                borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(5),
              ),
              onConfirm: (results) {
                // Update the selected items when confirmed
                setState(() {
                  _selectedItems = results.cast<String>();
                });
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Display the selected items
            Text(
              'Selected Items: ${_selectedItems.join(', ')}',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp and its title.
// 3. The MultiSelectExample widget is created, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 4. Inside the _MultiSelectExampleState, a list of MultiSelectItem objects is defined.
// 5. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body containing the MultiSelectDialogField.
// 6. When the user selects items and confirms, the onConfirm callback updates the _selectedItems list.
// 7. The selected items are displayed below the dropdown, updating dynamically as the user makes selections.
