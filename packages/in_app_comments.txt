</dict>

### Basic Usage

To use the `in_app_comments` package, you need to initialize it in your main application file. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set it up:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:in_app_comments/in_app_comments.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'In-App Comments Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('In-App Comments'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Open the comments section
            InAppComments.showComments();
          },
          child: Text('Leave a Comment'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the user taps the "Leave a Comment" button, the comments section will open, allowing them to submit their feedback.

## Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:in_app_comments/in_app_comments.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'In-App Comments Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('In-App Comments'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Open the comments section
            InAppComments.showComments();
          },
          child: Text('Leave a Comment'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. The Center widget contains an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, it calls InAppComments.showComments(), which opens the comments interface.
// 6. Users can then leave their comments, which will be processed by the package.
```
