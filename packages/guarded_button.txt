# Guarded Button: A Flutter Package for Enhanced Button Control

The **guarded_button** package is a Flutter library designed to provide enhanced control over button interactions, particularly in scenarios where you want to prevent multiple taps or ensure certain conditions are met before executing an action. This package is particularly useful in forms, where you want to avoid duplicate submissions or in scenarios where a button should only be enabled under specific conditions.

## When to Use Guarded Button
- **Form Submissions**: Prevent multiple submissions of a form.
- **Network Requests**: Ensure that a button is only clickable when a network request is in progress.
- **Conditional Actions**: Enable or disable buttons based on user input or application state.

## Key Features
- **Guarded State**: Automatically manages the button's enabled/disabled state based on conditions.
- **Customizable**: Allows for customization of the button's appearance and behavior.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that integrates seamlessly with existing Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Guarded Button

## Installation
To use the **guarded_button** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  guarded_button: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Usage
### Basic Setup
To use the **guarded_button**, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:guarded_button/guarded_button.dart';
```

### Platform-Specific Details
- **Android**: No additional configuration is required for Android.
- **iOS**: Ensure that your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`.

### Example Usage
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the **guarded_button** in a Flutter application:

```dart
GuardedButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // Your action here
  },
  child: Text('Submit'),
  guard: () {
    // Logic to determine if the button should be enabled
    return true; // or false based on your conditions
  },
);
```

This example shows a basic implementation where the button will only be enabled if the `guard` function returns true.

# Complete Example of Guarded Button in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:guarded_button/guarded_button.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Guarded Button Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Guarded Button Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: GuardedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Action to perform when the button is pressed
              print('Button Pressed!');
            },
            child: Text('Submit'),
            guard: () {
              // Logic to determine if the button should be enabled
              // For example, check if a form is valid
              return true; // Change this based on your conditions
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'Guarded Button Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 5. The child of the Center is a GuardedButton, which takes an onPressed callback and a guard function.
// 6. When the button is pressed, it prints 'Button Pressed!' to the console.
// 7. The guard function determines if the button is enabled or disabled based on the logic provided.
// 8. In this example, the button is always enabled since the guard function returns true.
