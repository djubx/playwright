# Setting Up and Using the ud_design Package

## Installation
To get started with the `ud_design` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ud_design: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, make sure to set the platform version in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
Once the package is installed, you can start using its widgets in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use a pre-built button from the `ud_design` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ud_design/ud_design.dart'; // Import the package

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('UD Design Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: UDButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Action when button is pressed
              print('Button Pressed!');
            },
            child: Text('Click Me'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to create a simple app with a button using the `ud_design` package. The `UDButton` widget is a customizable button that can be styled according to your design needs.

With this setup, you are ready to explore the various widgets and features provided by the `ud_design` package in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Using ud_design

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ud_design/ud_design.dart'; // Import the ud_design package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'UD Design Demo', // Set the title of the app
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue, // Define the primary color theme
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(), // Set the home screen of the app
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home Screen')), // App bar with title
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center, // Center the column
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Welcome to UD Design!', // Welcome text
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24), // Text style
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between text and button
            UDButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action when button is pressed
                showDialog(
                  context: context,
                  builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                    title: Text('Button Clicked!'), // Dialog title
                    content: Text('You clicked the button!'), // Dialog content
                    actions: <Widget>[
                      TextButton(
                        onPressed: () {
                          Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                        },
                        child: Text('OK'), // OK button
                      ),
                    ],
                  ),
                );
              },
              child: Text('Click Me'), // Button text
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
// The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// The HomeScreen widget is defined as the home of the app, which contains a Scaffold.
// The Scaffold has an AppBar with a title and a body that centers its content.
// Inside the body, a Column widget is used to arrange the welcome text and button vertically.
// The UDButton widget is used to create a button that shows a dialog when pressed.
// The dialog displays a message and an OK button to dismiss it.
// This structure allows for easy customization and expansion of the app's functionality.
