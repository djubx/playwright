            print('Button Pressed!');
          },

class UserSettings extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
      child: Column(
        children: [
          Text('User Settings', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20)),
          // Additional settings can be added here
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

/*
  Application Flow Explanation:
  1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp with MyApp.
  2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme, and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
  3. RealFlutter builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body containing the ControlPanel widget.
  4. ControlPanel displays a button that, when pressed, prints a message to the console.
  5. It also includes a UserSettings widget that can be expanded to manage user preferences.
  6. The application is structured to allow easy customization and addition of features as needed.
