# Autotrie Flutter Package: A Detailed Overview
=====================================================

The Autotrie Flutter package is a powerful tool for implementing autocomplete functionality in Flutter applications. It provides a simple and efficient way to suggest words or phrases to users as they type.

### When to Use Autotrie

Autotrie is particularly useful in applications that require users to input text, such as search bars, text fields, or chat applications. It can help improve the user experience by providing quick and accurate suggestions, reducing the amount of typing required.

### Features

*   Fast and efficient autocomplete suggestions
*   Support for custom data sources
*   Configurable suggestion limits and timeouts
*   Platform-agnostic implementation

# Setting Up and Using Autotrie
================================

### Step 1: Add the Autotrie Package to Your Project

Add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  autotrie: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Autotrie Package

Import the Autotrie package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:autotrie/autotrie.dart';
```

### Step 3: Create an Autotrie Instance

Create an instance of the Autotrie class, passing in a list of words or phrases to use as suggestions:

```dart
final autotrie = Autotrie(words: ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']);
```

### Step 4: Use the Autotrie Instance

Use the Autotrie instance to get suggestions for a given input string:

```dart
final suggestions = autotrie.getSuggestions('a');
print(suggestions); // Output: ['apple']
```

### Platform-Specific Details

The Autotrie package is platform-agnostic, meaning it can be used on both Android and iOS devices without any additional configuration.

### Configurations and Optimizations

The Autotrie package provides several configuration options to optimize its performance:

*   `suggestionLimit`: The maximum number of suggestions to return.
*   `timeout`: The maximum amount of time to wait for suggestions.

These options can be passed to the Autotrie constructor to customize its behavior:

```dart
final autotrie = Autotrie(
  words: ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'],
  suggestionLimit: 5,
  timeout: Duration(milliseconds: 500),
);
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:autotrie/autotrie.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Autotrie Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  final _textController = TextEditingController();
  final _autotrie = Autotrie(words: ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']);
  List<String> _suggestions = [];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Autotrie Demo'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(20.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              controller: _textController,
              onChanged: (text) {
                final suggestions = _autotrie.getSuggestions(text);
                setState(() {
                  _suggestions = suggestions;
                });
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Expanded(
              child: ListView.builder(
                itemCount: _suggestions.length,
                itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                  return ListTile(
                    title: Text(_suggestions[index]),
                  );
                },
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user types a string into the text field.
// 2. The `onChanged` callback is called, which gets the suggestions from the Autotrie instance.
// 3. The suggestions are stored in the `_suggestions` list and the widget is rebuilt.
// 4. The suggestions are displayed in the list view below the text field.
// This process is repeated for each character the user types, providing a seamless autocomplete experience.

// The Autotrie instance is created with a list of words and is used to get suggestions for the user's input.
// The suggestions are then displayed in a list view, allowing the user to select a suggestion to complete their input.

// In summary, this code demonstrates how to use the Autotrie package to provide autocomplete suggestions in a Flutter application.
// It shows how to create an Autotrie instance, get suggestions for a given input string, and display the suggestions in a list view.
