# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using hl_image_picker_android

## Installation
To get started with the `hl_image_picker_android` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  hl_image_picker_android: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/hl_image_picker_android).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. **Permissions**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file. Add the following lines inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: If you are using AndroidX, ensure your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
}
```

### iOS
1. **Permissions**: Add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file to request permission for camera and photo library access:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to take photos.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to select images.</string>
```

## Using the Package
To use the `hl_image_picker_android` package, you can create a simple Flutter widget that allows users to pick images. Below is a basic example of how to implement this functionality.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:hl_image_picker_android/hl_image_picker_android.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  List<String> _imagePaths = []; // List to store selected image paths

  // Function to pick images
  Future<void> _pickImages() async {
    // Use the image picker to select images
    List<String>? selectedImages = await HlImagePickerAndroid.pickImages(
      maxImages: 5, // Limit to 5 images
    );

    // Update the state with the selected images
    if (selectedImages != null) {
      setState(() {
        _imagePaths = selectedImages;
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Image Picker Example'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: _pickImages, // Call the image picker on button press
            child: Text('Pick Images'),
          ),
          Expanded(
            child: GridView.builder(
              gridDelegate: SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount(
                crossAxisCount: 3, // Display 3 images per row
              ),
              itemCount: _imagePaths.length,
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                return Image.file(
                  File(_imagePaths[index]), // Display the selected images
                  fit: BoxFit.cover,
                );
              },
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of hl_image_picker_android

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:hl_image_picker_android/hl_image_picker_android.dart';
import 'dart:io'; // Import for File handling

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  List<String> _imagePaths = []; // List to store selected image paths

  // Function to pick images
  Future<void> _pickImages() async {
    // Use the image picker to select images
    List<String>? selectedImages = await HlImagePickerAndroid.pickImages(
      maxImages: 5, // Limit to 5 images
    );

    // Update the state with the selected images
    if (selectedImages != null) {
      setState(() {
        _imagePaths = selectedImages; // Store selected images in state
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Image Picker Example'), // App title
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: _pickImages, // Call the image picker on button press
            child: Text('Pick Images'), // Button text
          ),
          Expanded(
            child: GridView.builder(
              gridDelegate: SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount(
                crossAxisCount: 3, // Display 3 images per row
              ),
              itemCount: _imagePaths.length, // Number of images to display
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                return Image.file(
                  File(_imagePaths[index]), // Display the selected images
                  fit: BoxFit.cover, // Fit the image within the grid cell
                );
              },
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 2. The _RealFlutterState class manages the state of the widget.
// 3. A list _imagePaths is initialized to store the paths of selected images.
// 4. The _pickImages function is defined to handle image selection.
// 5. When the user presses the "Pick Images" button, the _pickImages function is called.
// 6. The image picker opens, allowing the user to select up to 5 images.
// 7. Once images are selected, the state is updated with the selected image paths.
// 8. The GridView.builder displays the selected images in a grid format.
// 9. Each image is displayed using the Image.file widget, which takes the file path from _imagePaths.
