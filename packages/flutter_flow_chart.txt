# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_flow_chart

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_flow_chart` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_flow_chart` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_flow_chart: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Open the `Podfile` and uncomment the platform line, setting it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that the package is set up, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to create a flow chart using the `flutter_flow_chart` package.

# Complete Example of flutter_flow_chart

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_flow_chart/flutter_flow_chart.dart'; // Import the package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the main application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Flow Chart Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flow Chart Example'), // App bar title
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: FlowChart(
            nodes: [
              // Define nodes for the flow chart
              FlowChartNode(
                id: 'start',
                label: 'Start',
                color: Colors.green,
              ),
              FlowChartNode(
                id: 'process1',
                label: 'Process 1',
                color: Colors.blue,
              ),
              FlowChartNode(
                id: 'decision',
                label: 'Decision',
                color: Colors.orange,
              ),
              FlowChartNode(
                id: 'process2',
                label: 'Process 2',
                color: Colors.blue,
              ),
              FlowChartNode(
                id: 'end',
                label: 'End',
                color: Colors.red,
              ),
            ],
            edges: [
              // Define edges connecting the nodes
              FlowChartEdge(from: 'start', to: 'process1'),
              FlowChartEdge(from: 'process1', to: 'decision'),
              FlowChartEdge(from: 'decision', to: 'process2', label: 'Yes'),
              FlowChartEdge(from: 'decision', to: 'end', label: 'No'),
              FlowChartEdge(from: 'process2', to: 'end'),
            ],
            // Set the layout of the flow chart
            layout: FlowChartLayout.vertical,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Flow Chart Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers a FlowChart widget.
// 5. The FlowChart widget defines nodes and edges to create a flow chart.
// 6. Nodes represent different steps in the process, while edges connect these steps.
// 7. The layout is set to vertical, displaying the flow chart in a top-down manner.
```
