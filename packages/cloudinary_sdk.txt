<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Cloudinary SDK for Flutter

The `cloudinary_sdk` Flutter package is a powerful tool that allows developers to easily integrate Cloudinary's media management capabilities into their Flutter applications. Cloudinary is a cloud-based service that provides a comprehensive solution for managing images and videos, including uploading, transforming, optimizing, and delivering media assets.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `cloudinary_sdk` package when:
- You need to manage a large number of images or videos in your application.
- You want to optimize media delivery for different devices and network conditions.
- You require advanced image and video transformations (e.g., resizing, cropping, applying filters).
- You want to leverage Cloudinary's CDN for faster media delivery.

## Features

- **Easy Uploads**: Upload images and videos directly from your Flutter app to Cloudinary.
- **Transformations**: Apply various transformations to your media files on-the-fly.
- **Optimized Delivery**: Automatically deliver optimized media based on the user's device and network conditions.
- **Secure Access**: Manage access to your media files with secure URLs and authentication.

With these features, the `cloudinary_sdk` package simplifies the process of handling media in Flutter applications, making it an essential tool for developers focused on media-rich applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Cloudinary SDK

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `cloudinary_sdk` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `cloudinary_sdk` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cloudinary_sdk: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Configure for Android

For Android, ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

## Step 3: Configure for iOS

For iOS, you need to add the following permissions in your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to upload images.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to take photos.</string>
```

## Step 4: Initialize Cloudinary

In your Flutter application, initialize the Cloudinary SDK with your Cloudinary credentials. You can find these in your Cloudinary dashboard.

```dart
import 'package:cloudinary_sdk/cloudinary_sdk.dart';

class RealFlutter {
  final Cloudinary cloudinary;

  RealFlutter() : cloudinary = Cloudinary(
    'your_cloud_name', 
    'your_api_key', 
    'your_api_secret'
  );
}
```

## Step 5: Uploading Media

You can now upload images or videos using the `upload` method. Hereâ€™s an example of how to upload an image:

```dart
Future<void> uploadImage(String filePath) async {
  final response = await cloudinary.uploadFile(
    CloudinaryFile.fromFile(filePath, resourceType: CloudinaryResourceType.image),
  );

  if (response.isSuccessful) {
    print('Upload successful: ${response.secureUrl}');
  } else {
    print('Upload failed: ${response.error?.message}');
  }
}
```

## Step 6: Transforming Media

You can also apply transformations to your media files. For example, to resize an image:

```dart
String transformedUrl = cloudinary.url(
  'public_id_of_image',
  transformation: [
    Transformation.width(300).height(300).crop('fill'),
  ],
);
```

This will generate a URL that delivers the transformed image.

With these steps, you can effectively set up and use the `cloudinary_sdk` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using Cloudinary SDK in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cloudinary_sdk/cloudinary_sdk.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  // Initialize Cloudinary with your credentials
  final Cloudinary cloudinary = Cloudinary(
    'your_cloud_name', 
    'your_api_key', 
    'your_api_secret'
  );

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Cloudinary SDK Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Cloudinary SDK Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Call the uploadImage method when the button is pressed
              await uploadImage('path_to_your_image.jpg');
            },
            child: Text('Upload Image'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Method to upload an image to Cloudinary
  Future<void> uploadImage(String filePath) async {
    // Upload the file to Cloudinary
    final response = await cloudinary.uploadFile(
      CloudinaryFile.fromFile(filePath, resourceType: CloudinaryResourceType.image),
    );

    // Check if the upload was successful
    if (response.isSuccessful) {
      // Print the secure URL of the uploaded image
      print('Upload successful: ${response.secureUrl}');
    } else {
      // Print the error message if the upload failed
      print('Upload failed: ${response.error?.message}');
    }
  }
}

// The main function to run the app
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

/*
  Application Flow Explanation:
  1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
  2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a button to upload an image.
  3. When the button is pressed, the uploadImage method is called with the path to the image.
  4. The uploadImage method uses the Cloudinary SDK to upload the image.
  5. If the upload is successful, the secure URL of the uploaded image is printed; otherwise, an error message is displayed.
