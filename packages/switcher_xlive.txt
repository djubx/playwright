# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `switcher_xlive`

## Installation

To get started with the `switcher_xlive` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  switcher_xlive: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/switcher_xlive).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package

To use the `switcher_xlive` package, you can create a simple Flutter application that demonstrates its capabilities. Below is a basic example of how to implement a switcher using this package.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:switcher_xlive/switcher_xlive.dart';
```

2. Create a StatefulWidget to manage the state of the switcher.

3. Use the `Switcher` widget to wrap the content you want to switch between.

4. Define the animation properties as needed.

This setup will allow you to create a dynamic interface that responds to user interactions with smooth transitions.

# Complete Example of `switcher_xlive`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:switcher_xlive/switcher_xlive.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // State variable to track which widget to display
  bool _isFirstWidget = true;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Switcher XLive Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          // Using Switcher widget to animate between two different widgets
          child: Switcher(
            duration: Duration(milliseconds: 500), // Animation duration
            child: _isFirstWidget
                ? Container(
                    key: ValueKey(1), // Unique key for the first widget
                    color: Colors.blue,
                    width: 200,
                    height: 200,
                    child: Center(child: Text('First Widget', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white))),
                  )
                : Container(
                    key: ValueKey(2), // Unique key for the second widget
                    color: Colors.red,
                    width: 200,
                    height: 200,
                    child: Center(child: Text('Second Widget', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white))),
                  ),
          ),
        ),
        floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Toggle the state to switch between widgets
            setState(() {
              _isFirstWidget = !_isFirstWidget;
            });
          },
          child: Icon(Icons.swap_horiz), // Icon for the button
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of which widget to display.
// 3. The build method returns a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, the Switcher widget is used to animate between two containers based on the _isFirstWidget state.
// 5. Each container has a unique key to help the Switcher identify which widget to animate.
// 6. A FloatingActionButton is provided to toggle the state, which triggers a rebuild and switches the displayed widget.
// 7. The animation occurs smoothly due to the Switcher widget's built-in capabilities.
