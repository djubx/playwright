Here's a detailed technical blog on the `form_builder_extra_fields` Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Description

The `form_builder_extra_fields` package is a powerful Flutter library that extends the capabilities of the `flutter_form_builder` package by providing additional form fields and validation options. This package is particularly useful for developers who need to create complex forms with custom validation rules and additional input types that are not available in the standard Flutter form widgets.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `form_builder_extra_fields` package when:
- You need to implement forms that require advanced input types such as sliders, date pickers, or custom dropdowns.
- You want to enhance user experience with better validation and error handling.
- You are building applications that require dynamic forms where fields can be added or removed based on user input.

## Features

- **Custom Form Fields**: Includes a variety of additional fields like `FormBuilderSlider`, `FormBuilderDateTimePicker`, and more.
- **Validation**: Provides built-in validation methods to ensure data integrity.
- **Dynamic Forms**: Supports dynamic form creation, allowing fields to be added or removed based on user interactions.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with the existing `flutter_form_builder` package, making it easy to extend your forms.

# Tutorial

## Setup Process

To get started with the `form_builder_extra_fields` package, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     flutter_form_builder: ^7.0.0
     form_builder_extra_fields: ^1.0.0
   ```

   Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the new packages.

2. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the correct minimum SDK version. For example:

     ```groovy
     android {
         ...
         defaultConfig {
             ...
             minSdkVersion 21 // or higher
         }
     }
     ```

   - **iOS**: Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add any necessary permissions for features like camera access if you are using fields that require it.

3. **Import the Package**: In your Dart files, import the necessary packages:

   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
   import 'package:flutter_form_builder/flutter_form_builder.dart';
   import 'package:form_builder_extra_fields/form_builder_extra_fields.dart';
   ```

## Using the Package

To use the `form_builder_extra_fields` package, you can create a form using the `FormBuilder` widget and include the extra fields as needed. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a form with a slider and a date picker:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Form Builder Extra Fields')),
      body: FormBuilder(
        child: Column(
          children: [
            FormBuilderSlider(
              name: 'slider',
              min: 0.0,
              max: 100.0,
              divisions: 10,
              onChanged: (value) {
                // Handle slider value change
              },
            ),
            FormBuilderDateTimePicker(
              name: 'date',
              inputType: InputType.date,
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Select Date'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Handle form submission
              },
              child: Text('Submit'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to create a simple form with a slider and a date picker. You can expand this by adding more fields and validation as needed.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_form_builder/flutter_form_builder.dart';
import 'package:form_builder_extra_fields/form_builder_extra_fields.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Form Builder Extra Fields Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  final _formKey = GlobalKey<FormBuilderState>(); // Key to manage the form state

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Form Builder Extra Fields')),
      body: FormBuilder(
        key: _formKey, // Assign the key to the FormBuilder
        child: Column(
          children: [
            // Slider field
            FormBuilderSlider(
              name: 'slider', // Name of the field
              min: 0.0, // Minimum value
              max: 100.0, // Maximum value
              divisions: 10, // Number of divisions
              onChanged: (value) {
                // Handle slider value change
                print('Slider value: $value');
              },
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Select a value'), // Label for the slider
            ),
            // Date picker field
            FormBuilderDateTimePicker(
              name: 'date', // Name of the field
              inputType: InputType.date, // Input type for the date picker
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Select Date'), // Label for the date picker
            ),
            // Submit button
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                if (_formKey.currentState?.saveAndValidate() ?? false) {
                  // If the form is valid, print the values
                  print(_formKey.currentState?.value);
                } else {
                  // If the form is invalid, print an error message
                  print('Form is invalid');
                }
              },
              child: Text('Submit'), // Button label
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that manages the form state using a GlobalKey.
// 4. The build method of RealFlutter creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a FormBuilder.
// 5. Inside the FormBuilder, a slider and a date picker are added as form fields.
// 6. The slider allows users to select a value between 0 and 100, while the date picker allows users to select a date.
// 7. When the submit button is pressed, the form validates the input and prints the values if valid, or an error message if invalid.
