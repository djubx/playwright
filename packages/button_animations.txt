# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Button Animations Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `button_animations` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  button_animations: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:button_animations/button_animations.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Animated Buttons

You can now use the animated buttons in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement an animated button:

```dart
ButtonAnimator(
  onTap: () {
    // Action to perform on button tap
  },
  child: Text('Click Me'),
)
```

This will create a button that animates when tapped. You can customize the animation properties as needed.

# Complete Example of Using Button Animations

import 'package:button_animations/button_animations.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Button Animations Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Button Animations Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Animated button with scale effect
              ButtonAnimator(
                onTap: () {
                  // Action to perform on button tap
                  print('Scale Button Tapped!');
                },
                child: Container(
                  padding: EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 20, vertical: 10),
                  decoration: BoxDecoration(
                    color: Colors.blue,
                    borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(8),
                  ),
                  child: Text(
                    'Scale Animation',
                    style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 16),
                  ),
                ),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between buttons
              // Animated button with rotation effect
              ButtonAnimator(
                onTap: () {
                  // Action to perform on button tap
                  print('Rotate Button Tapped!');
                },
                child: Container(
                  padding: EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 20, vertical: 10),
                  decoration: BoxDecoration(
                    color: Colors.green,
                    borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(8),
                  ),
                  child: Text(
                    'Rotate Animation',
                    style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 16),
                  ),
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that centers its child.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange two animated buttons vertically.
// 5. Each button is wrapped in a ButtonAnimator widget, which provides the animation effect.
// 6. When a button is tapped, it triggers the onTap callback, printing a message to the console.
// 7. The buttons are styled with padding, background color, and rounded corners for a better appearance.
