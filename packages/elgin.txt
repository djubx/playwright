# Elgin Flutter Package: A Comprehensive Overview

The **Elgin** Flutter package is designed to facilitate seamless integration with Elgin's hardware devices, primarily focusing on point-of-sale (POS) systems. This package is particularly useful for developers building applications that require interaction with Elgin's devices, such as printers and payment terminals. 

## When to Use Elgin
You should consider using the Elgin package when:
- Developing applications that need to print receipts or invoices directly from a Flutter app.
- Integrating payment processing features that require communication with Elgin's payment terminals.
- Building applications for retail or hospitality sectors where POS systems are essential.

## Key Features
- **Device Communication**: Establishes a connection with Elgin devices over Bluetooth or USB.
- **Printing Capabilities**: Supports various printing formats, including text and images.
- **Payment Processing**: Facilitates secure transactions through Elgin's payment terminals.
- **Error Handling**: Provides robust error handling mechanisms to manage device communication issues.

The Elgin package streamlines the development process for applications that require direct interaction with Elgin's hardware, making it a valuable tool for Flutter developers in the retail and hospitality industries.

# Elgin Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the Elgin package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  elgin: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/elgin).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. **Permissions**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Update your `build.gradle` file to include the required dependencies.

### iOS
1. **Permissions**: Add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file to request Bluetooth permissions:

```xml
<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires Bluetooth access to connect to Elgin devices.</string>
<key>NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires Bluetooth access to connect to Elgin devices.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the Elgin package, you need to initialize the connection and perform operations like printing or processing payments. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set up the connection:

```dart
import 'package:elgin/elgin.dart';

void main() async {
  // Initialize the Elgin connection
  final elgin = Elgin();

  // Connect to the device
  await elgin.connect();

  // Print a sample receipt
  await elgin.printReceipt("Hello, Elgin!");

  // Disconnect from the device
  await elgin.disconnect();
}
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to initialize the Elgin connection, print a receipt, and then disconnect from the device. Make sure to handle exceptions and errors appropriately in a production environment.

# Complete Example of Elgin Package in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:elgin/elgin.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  final Elgin elgin = Elgin(); // Create an instance of the Elgin class
  String statusMessage = "Disconnected"; // Status message to show connection state

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _connectToDevice(); // Attempt to connect to the Elgin device on startup
  }

  // Method to connect to the Elgin device
  Future<void> _connectToDevice() async {
    try {
      await elgin.connect(); // Connect to the Elgin device
      setState(() {
        statusMessage = "Connected"; // Update status message
      });
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        statusMessage = "Connection Failed: $e"; // Handle connection error
      });
    }
  }

  // Method to print a sample receipt
  Future<void> _printReceipt() async {
    try {
      await elgin.printReceipt("Hello, Elgin!"); // Print a sample receipt
      setState(() {
        statusMessage = "Receipt Printed"; // Update status message
      });
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        statusMessage = "Print Failed: $e"; // Handle print error
      });
    }
  }

  // Method to disconnect from the Elgin device
  Future<void> _disconnect() async {
    await elgin.disconnect(); // Disconnect from the Elgin device
    setState(() {
      statusMessage = "Disconnected"; // Update status message
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text("Elgin Flutter Example"), // App title
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text(statusMessage), // Display connection status
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _printReceipt, // Print receipt on button press
                child: Text("Print Receipt"),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _disconnect, // Disconnect on button press
                child: Text("Disconnect"),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application that connects to an Elgin device, prints a receipt, and allows the user to disconnect. 
// 
// 1. **Initialization**: The app starts by creating an instance of the Elgin class and attempts to connect to the device in the `initState` method.
// 2. **Connection Handling**: The `_connectToDevice` method manages the connection process and updates the UI based on success or failure.
// 3. **Printing**: The `_printReceipt` method is called when the user presses the "Print Receipt" button, which sends a print command to the Elgin device.
// 4. **Disconnection**: The `_disconnect` method allows the user to disconnect from the device, updating the status message accordingly.
// 5. **UI**: The app displays the current connection status and provides buttons for printing and disconnecting.
