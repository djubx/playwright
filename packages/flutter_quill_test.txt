# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Flutter Quill Test

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_quill_test` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_quill_test` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_quill_test: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file, especially if you plan to use features like image uploading. Add the following lines to your `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to the photo library.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to the camera.</string>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple rich text editor using `flutter_quill_test`. Below is a basic implementation.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_quill_test/flutter_quill.dart' as quill;
```

2. Create a StatefulWidget to manage the editor state:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  quill.QuillController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _controller = quill.QuillController.basic();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Quill Test'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          quill.QuillToolbar.basic(controller: _controller),
          Expanded(
            child: quill.QuillEditor.basic(
              controller: _controller,
              readOnly: false, // Set to true to make it read-only
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Run your application, and you should see a basic rich text editor with a toolbar.

With this setup, you can start using the rich text editor in your Flutter application. You can further customize the toolbar and editor based on your requirements.

# Complete Example of Flutter Quill Test

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_quill_test/flutter_quill.dart' as quill;

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Quill Test',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Initialize the Quill controller
  quill.QuillController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Create a basic Quill controller
    _controller = quill.QuillController.basic();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Quill Test'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Toolbar for text formatting
          quill.QuillToolbar.basic(controller: _controller),
          Expanded(
            // Quill editor for rich text input
            child: quill.QuillEditor.basic(
              controller: _controller,
              readOnly: false, // Set to true to make it read-only
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home of the app is set to RealFlutter, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 4. In RealFlutter, we initialize a QuillController in initState to manage the editor's state.
// 5. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Column.
// 6. The Column contains a QuillToolbar for text formatting and a QuillEditor for text input.
// 7. The QuillEditor is linked to the controller, allowing for rich text editing capabilities.
```
