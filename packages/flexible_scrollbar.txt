# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Flexible Scrollbar Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **flexible_scrollbar** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flexible_scrollbar: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Flexible Scrollbar

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the **flexible_scrollbar** in a scrollable list.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flexible_scrollbar/flexible_scrollbar.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flexible Scrollbar Example')),
        body: FlexibleScrollbar(
          child: ListView.builder(
            itemCount: 100,
            itemBuilder: (context, index) {
              return ListTile(
                title: Text('Item $index'),
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we wrap a `ListView` with the `FlexibleScrollbar` widget, which automatically provides a customizable scrollbar for the list.

# Complete Example of Flexible Scrollbar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flexible_scrollbar/flexible_scrollbar.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flexible Scrollbar Example')),
        body: FlexibleScrollbar(
          // The child widget that will have the scrollbar
          child: ListView.builder(
            itemCount: 100, // Total number of items in the list
            itemBuilder: (context, index) {
              return ListTile(
                title: Text('Item $index'), // Displaying item number
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the app
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the main UI.
// 3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// 4. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Flexible Scrollbar Example'.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains a FlexibleScrollbar widget.
// 6. The FlexibleScrollbar wraps a ListView.builder, which creates a scrollable list of 100 items.
// 7. Each item in the list is represented by a ListTile displaying its index.
// 8. When the user scrolls through the list, the FlexibleScrollbar provides a customizable scrollbar for better navigation.
