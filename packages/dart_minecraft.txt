# Overview of the dart_minecraft Flutter Package

The `dart_minecraft` package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who want to create Minecraft-like experiences within their applications. This package provides a range of features that allow developers to build voxel-based worlds, manipulate blocks, and create interactive environments reminiscent of the popular game.

## When to Use This Package
You might consider using `dart_minecraft` in scenarios such as:
- Developing educational applications that teach programming or game design.
- Creating games that require a voxel-based environment.
- Building interactive simulations or visualizations that benefit from a 3D space.

## Key Features
- **Voxel Rendering**: Efficiently render voxel-based graphics, allowing for the creation of 3D environments.
- **Block Manipulation**: Easily add, remove, and modify blocks in the environment.
- **User Interaction**: Support for user input to interact with the voxel world.
- **Customizable Worlds**: Create and customize different worlds with various themes and styles.

With these features, `dart_minecraft` opens up a world of possibilities for developers looking to create engaging and interactive applications.

# Setting Up and Using the dart_minecraft Package

## Installation
To get started with the `dart_minecraft` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dart_minecraft: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable certain capabilities in your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file, depending on the features you plan to use. For example, if you are using location services, you would add:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your location.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `dart_minecraft` package, you will typically start by creating a new instance of the main class, `RealFlutter`, and setting up the voxel environment. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initialize the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dart_minecraft/dart_minecraft.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Minecraft Voxel App',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a basic Flutter application that initializes the `RealFlutter` class, which will handle the voxel rendering and interactions.

# Complete Example of Using dart_minecraft

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dart_minecraft/dart_minecraft.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Minecraft Voxel App',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Initialize the Minecraft world
  late MinecraftWorld world;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Create a new Minecraft world
    world = MinecraftWorld();
    // Populate the world with some blocks
    _populateWorld();
  }

  void _populateWorld() {
    // Add blocks to the world
    for (int x = 0; x < 10; x++) {
      for (int y = 0; y < 10; y++) {
        world.addBlock(BlockType.grass, x, 0, y); // Add grass blocks
      }
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Minecraft Voxel App'),
      ),
      body: MinecraftView(world: world), // Render the Minecraft world
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter initializes a MinecraftWorld instance in initState.
// 4. The _populateWorld method is called to fill the world with grass blocks.
// 5. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a MinecraftView to render the world.
