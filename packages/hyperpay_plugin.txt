# Setting Up and Using the Hyperpay Plugin in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `hyperpay_plugin` and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- Flutter SDK installed
- A HyperPay account with API credentials

## Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the `hyperpay_plugin` to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  hyperpay_plugin: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Setup

### Android

1. **Update `AndroidManifest.xml`**: Add the necessary permissions and configurations.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<application>
    <!-- Add HyperPay specific configurations here -->
</application>
```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure your `build.gradle` files are set up to support the plugin.

### iOS

1. **Update `Info.plist`**: Add required configurations for HyperPay.

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. **Podfile**: Ensure your Podfile is updated to include necessary dependencies.

## Step 3: Initialize the Plugin

In your Flutter app, initialize the `RealFlutter` class to start using the plugin.

```dart
import 'package:hyperpay_plugin/hyperpay_plugin.dart';

class RealFlutter {
  final HyperpayPlugin _hyperpayPlugin = HyperpayPlugin();

  Future<void> initialize() async {
    await _hyperpayPlugin.initialize();
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Implement Payment Processing

Use the `RealFlutter` class to handle payment processing.

```dart
class PaymentService {
  final RealFlutter _realFlutter = RealFlutter();

  Future<void> processPayment() async {
    await _realFlutter.initialize();
    // Add payment processing logic here
  }
}
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:hyperpay_plugin/hyperpay_plugin.dart';

// Main class to handle HyperPay integration
class RealFlutter {
  final HyperpayPlugin _hyperpayPlugin = HyperpayPlugin();

  // Initialize the HyperPay plugin
  Future<void> initialize() async {
    await _hyperpayPlugin.initialize();
  }

  // Method to start a payment transaction
  Future<void> startPayment() async {
    // Logic to start payment
    // This is where you would typically call HyperPay's payment methods
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  final RealFlutter _realFlutter = RealFlutter();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('HyperPay Integration'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initialize the payment plugin
              await _realFlutter.initialize();
              // Start the payment process
              await _realFlutter.startPayment();
            },
            child: Text('Pay Now'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow:
// 1. The application starts with the `main` function, which runs `MyApp`.
// 2. `MyApp` is a StatelessWidget that builds the main UI of the app.
// 3. The app consists of a single button labeled "Pay Now".
// 4. When the button is pressed, it triggers the `initialize` method of the `RealFlutter` class.
// 5. After initialization, the `startPayment` method is called to handle the payment process.
// 6. The `RealFlutter` class uses the `hyperpay_plugin` to manage payment transactions.
