# Setting Up the Package
-------------------------

To use the `flutter_syntax_view` package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

Add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  flutter_syntax_view: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_syntax_view/flutter_syntax_view.dart';
```

### Step 3: Use the Package

Create a `SyntaxView` widget and pass in the code you want to display:

```dart
SyntaxView(
  code: 'void main() {\n  print("Hello, World!");\n}',
  language: 'dart',
  theme: SyntaxTheme.dracula(),
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details

The `flutter_syntax_view` package works on both Android and iOS platforms. However, you may need to adjust the font size and style to match the platform's default font.

### Configurations and Optimizations

You can customize the syntax highlighting by creating a custom `SyntaxTheme`. You can also optimize the performance by using a `SyntaxCache` to store the parsed syntax.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_syntax_view/flutter_syntax_view.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a SyntaxView widget with some sample Dart code
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Syntax View Example'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: SyntaxView(
            // Code to display
            code: 'void main() {\n  print("Hello, World!");\n}',
            // Language of the code
            language: 'dart',
            // Custom theme for the syntax highlighting
            theme: SyntaxTheme.dracula(),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The RealFlutter widget is created and returned as the root of the app.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold has an AppBar with a title and a body with a Padding.
// 4. The Padding contains a SyntaxView widget with some sample Dart code.
// 5. The SyntaxView widget displays the code with syntax highlighting using the custom theme.
// 6. The user can view the code and appreciate the syntax highlighting.

// In summary, this code creates a simple Flutter app that displays some sample Dart code with syntax highlighting.
