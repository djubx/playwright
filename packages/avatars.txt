# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Avatars Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the Avatars package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  avatars: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configurations

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Avatars Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create an avatar:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:avatars/avatars.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Avatars Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Avatar(
            name: 'John Doe',
            size: 100,
            backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
            borderColor: Colors.white,
            borderWidth: 2,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that displays an avatar with the name "John Doe". The avatar has a blue background, a white border, and a size of 100 pixels.

# Complete Example: RealFlutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:avatars/avatars.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Avatars Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Centering the avatar in the middle of the screen
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Displaying the first avatar with a name
              Avatar(
                name: 'John Doe',
                size: 100,
                backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
                borderColor: Colors.white,
                borderWidth: 2,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between avatars
              // Displaying the second avatar with initials
              Avatar(
                name: 'Jane Smith',
                size: 100,
                backgroundColor: Colors.green,
                borderColor: Colors.white,
                borderWidth: 2,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between avatars
              // Displaying an avatar with a placeholder image
              Avatar(
                size: 100,
                backgroundColor: Colors.red,
                borderColor: Colors.white,
                borderWidth: 2,
                image: NetworkImage('https://example.com/image.jpg'), // Replace with a valid image URL
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Avatars Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers a Column widget that holds multiple Avatar widgets.
// 5. Each Avatar widget displays a different user representation, showcasing the package's features:
//    - The first avatar shows a name with a blue background.
//    - The second avatar shows another name with a green background.
//    - The third avatar uses a network image, demonstrating how to load images from the web.
// 6. The avatars are styled with borders and sizes, making them visually appealing and customizable.
