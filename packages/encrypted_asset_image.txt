# Encrypted Asset Image: A Secure Way to Handle Images in Flutter

The `encrypted_asset_image` package is a Flutter library designed to securely load and display images that are stored in an encrypted format. This package is particularly useful for applications that require enhanced security for sensitive images, such as personal photos, confidential documents, or any media that should not be easily accessible.

## When to Use This Package
- **Sensitive Data**: When your application handles sensitive images that need to be protected from unauthorized access.
- **Data Privacy**: For apps that comply with data protection regulations and need to ensure user privacy.
- **Secure Storage**: When images are stored in a secure location and need to be decrypted before display.

## Features
- **Encryption Support**: Load images that are encrypted, ensuring that sensitive data is protected.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that integrates seamlessly with existing Flutter applications.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on both Android and iOS, providing a consistent experience across platforms.
- **Customizable**: Allows developers to specify their own encryption and decryption methods.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Encrypted Asset Image

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `encrypted_asset_image` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Package to Your Project
To get started, add the `encrypted_asset_image` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  encrypted_asset_image: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/encrypted_asset_image).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to display images.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is an example of how to load and display an encrypted image.

# Complete Example of Using Encrypted Asset Image

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:encrypted_asset_image/encrypted_asset_image.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Encrypted Asset Image Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Encrypted Asset Image Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: EncryptedAssetImage(
            // Specify the path to the encrypted image asset
            assetPath: 'assets/encrypted_image.png',
            // Provide a decryption key
            decryptionKey: 'your_decryption_key_here',
            // Optional: Specify a placeholder while the image is loading
            placeholder: CircularProgressIndicator(),
            // Optional: Specify an error widget if the image fails to load
            errorWidget: Icon(Icons.error),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Encrypted Asset Image Demo".
// 4. In the body of the Scaffold, we center an EncryptedAssetImage widget.
// 5. The EncryptedAssetImage widget takes the asset path of the encrypted image and a decryption key.
// 6. A CircularProgressIndicator is shown while the image is loading, and an error icon is displayed if the image fails to load.
// 7. This setup allows for secure loading and displaying of images in a Flutter application.
