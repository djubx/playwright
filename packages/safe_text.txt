Here's a detailed technical blog on the "safe_text" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Safe Text Flutter Package

The **safe_text** Flutter package is designed to help developers manage and display text safely within their applications. It provides a way to sanitize and format text inputs, ensuring that they are free from harmful content, such as HTML tags or scripts, which can lead to security vulnerabilities like XSS (Cross-Site Scripting).

## When to Use Safe Text

You should consider using the **safe_text** package in scenarios such as:

- **User-generated content**: When your application allows users to input text, such as comments or messages, it's crucial to sanitize this input to prevent malicious code execution.
- **Displaying rich text**: If your app displays formatted text from external sources, using **safe_text** can help ensure that the text is safe to render.
- **Data integrity**: When you need to maintain the integrity of the text data while ensuring it is displayed correctly without any security risks.

## Features

- **Sanitization**: Automatically removes harmful HTML tags and scripts from the text.
- **Customizable**: Allows developers to define their own sanitization rules.
- **Easy integration**: Simple to set up and use within any Flutter application.

By leveraging the **safe_text** package, developers can enhance the security and reliability of their applications while providing a better user experience.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Safe Text

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **safe_text** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  safe_text: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` file to allow for any specific permissions required by your app. However, the **safe_text** package does not require any special permissions.

## Step 3: Using Safe Text in Your Application

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the **safe_text** package to sanitize and display text.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:safe_text/safe_text.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample user input that may contain harmful content
    String userInput = "<script>alert('Hacked!');</script><b>Hello, World!</b>";

    // Sanitize the user input
    String safeOutput = SafeText.sanitize(userInput);

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Safe Text Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(safeOutput), // Display the sanitized text
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we import the **safe_text** package and use its `sanitize` method to clean the user input before displaying it in the app.

# Complete Example of Safe Text in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:safe_text/safe_text.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample user input that may contain harmful content
    String userInput = "<script>alert('Hacked!');</script><b>Hello, World!</b>";

    // Sanitize the user input
    String safeOutput = SafeText.sanitize(userInput);

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Safe Text Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(safeOutput), // Display the sanitized text
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. Inside the RealFlutter widget, we define a sample user input that contains a script tag, which is potentially harmful.
// 3. We use the SafeText.sanitize() method to clean the user input, removing any harmful content.
// 4. The sanitized output is then displayed in the center of the screen using a Text widget.
// 5. The AppBar displays the title "Safe Text Example", providing context to the user about the functionality of the app.
```
