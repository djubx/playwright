# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Super Circle Package

## Installation
To get started with the super_circle package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  super_circle: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/super_circle).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package
Once the package is installed, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a circular loading indicator using the super_circle package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:super_circle/super_circle.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Super Circle Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: SuperCircle(
          size: 100.0, // Size of the circle
          color: Colors.blue, // Color of the circle
          duration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Animation duration
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code creates a simple Flutter application with a circular loading indicator in the center of the screen. You can customize the size, color, and animation duration as needed.

# Complete Example of Using the Super Circle Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:super_circle/super_circle.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Super Circle Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Super Circle Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: SuperCircle(
          size: 100.0, // Set the size of the circle
          color: Colors.blue, // Set the color of the circle
          duration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Set the duration of the animation
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The main function initializes the Flutter app.
// MyApp is the root widget that sets up the MaterialApp.
// RealFlutter is the main screen of the app, containing a Scaffold.
// The Scaffold has an AppBar with a title and a Center widget in the body.
// Inside the Center widget, we use the SuperCircle widget to create a circular animation.
// The SuperCircle is configured with a size of 100.0, a blue color, and a 2-second animation duration.
// This creates a visually appealing circular loading indicator in the center of the screen.

```

``` 

In this complete example, we have created a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the super_circle package. The application initializes with a main function that runs the MyApp widget. The MyApp widget sets up a MaterialApp, and the RealFlutter widget serves as the main screen, featuring a circular loading indicator at its center. The SuperCircle widget is configured with customizable properties, allowing for easy adjustments to the size, color, and animation duration. This structure provides a clear and straightforward way to implement circular animations in your Flutter applications.
