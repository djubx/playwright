# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Guitar Chord Library

## Installation

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  guitar_chord_library: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No specific configurations are required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your app requires any specific capabilities related to audio or network access.

## Using the Package
To use the `guitar_chord_library`, you can import it into your Dart file as follows:

```dart
import 'package:guitar_chord_library/guitar_chord_library.dart';
```

You can then create instances of the `RealFlutter` class to display chords and manage chord progressions.

### Example Usage
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to display a chord:

```dart
RealFlutter chordDisplay = RealFlutter();
chordDisplay.displayChord('C'); // Displays the C major chord
```

This will render the C major chord in your application.

# Complete Example of Using the Guitar Chord Library

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:guitar_chord_library/guitar_chord_library.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Guitar Chord Library Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // List of chords to display
  final List<String> chords = ['C', 'G', 'D', 'A', 'E'];
  String selectedChord = 'C'; // Default chord

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Guitar Chord Library'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: [
          // Dropdown to select a chord
          DropdownButton<String>(
            value: selectedChord,
            items: chords.map((String chord) {
              return DropdownMenuItem<String>(
                value: chord,
                child: Text(chord),
              );
            }).toList(),
            onChanged: (String? newValue) {
              setState(() {
                selectedChord = newValue!;
              });
            },
          ),
          // Display the selected chord
          GuitarChordDisplay(chord: selectedChord),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Widget to display the guitar chord
class GuitarChordDisplay extends StatelessWidget {
  final String chord;

  GuitarChordDisplay({required this.chord});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(
      child: Text(
        'Chord: $chord',
        style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home as RealFlutter.
// 3. RealFlutter is a stateful widget that maintains the selected chord state.
// 4. The build method creates a dropdown menu for selecting chords and displays the selected chord.
// 5. When a user selects a chord from the dropdown, the state updates, and the displayed chord changes accordingly.
