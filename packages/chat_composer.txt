# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Chat Composer

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **chat_composer** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  chat_composer: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/chat_composer).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions for internet access and file storage if you plan to implement file attachments:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file for accessing the photo library:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to attach images.</string>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the chat composer in your app.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:chat_composer/chat_composer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Chat Composer Example',
      home: ChatScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ChatScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ChatScreenState createState() => _ChatScreenState();
}

class _ChatScreenState extends State<ChatScreen> {
  // List to hold messages
  List<String> messages = [];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Chat Composer Example'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Displaying the list of messages
          Expanded(
            child: ListView.builder(
              itemCount: messages.length,
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text(messages[index]),
                );
              },
            ),
          ),
          // Chat composer input field
          ChatComposer(
            onSend: (message) {
              // Adding the message to the list
              setState(() {
                messages.add(message);
              });
            },
            onAttachmentPressed: () {
              // Handle attachment logic here
              print("Attachment pressed");
            },
            onEmojiPressed: () {
              // Handle emoji logic here
              print("Emoji pressed");
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets RealFlutter as the root widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (ChatScreen).
// 3. ChatScreen maintains a list of messages and displays them in a ListView.
// 4. The ChatComposer widget is used at the bottom of the screen for user input.
// 5. When the user sends a message, the onSend callback is triggered, adding the message to the list and updating the UI.
// 6. The onAttachmentPressed and onEmojiPressed callbacks can be used to implement additional features like file attachments and emoji selection.
```
