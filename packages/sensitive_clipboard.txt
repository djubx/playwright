The `sensitive_clipboard` package is a Flutter plugin designed to enhance the security of clipboard operations in mobile applications. It provides a way to manage sensitive data in the clipboard, ensuring that such data is handled securely and is not exposed to unauthorized access.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `sensitive_clipboard` package in scenarios where your application deals with sensitive information, such as:

- Passwords
- Personal identification numbers (PINs)
- Credit card information
- Any other confidential data that should not be easily accessible

## Features

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Sensitive Clipboard

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `sensitive_clipboard` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  sensitive_clipboard: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
   ```

### iOS

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <key>NSClipboardUsageDescription</key>
   <string>This app requires access to the clipboard to manage sensitive data securely.</string>
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to copy sensitive data to the clipboard and clear it after a specified duration.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sensitive_clipboard/sensitive_clipboard.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Sensitive Clipboard Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Copy sensitive data to clipboard
              SensitiveClipboard.copy('Sensitive Data Here', duration: Duration(seconds: 10));
              // Notify user
              ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                SnackBar(content: Text('Sensitive data copied to clipboard!')),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Copy Sensitive Data'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, sensitive data is copied to the clipboard, and it will be cleared after 10 seconds.

# Complete Example of Sensitive Clipboard

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sensitive_clipboard/sensitive_clipboard.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Sensitive Clipboard Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Copy sensitive data to clipboard
              SensitiveClipboard.copy('Sensitive Data Here', duration: Duration(seconds: 10));
              // Notify user
              ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                SnackBar(content: Text('Sensitive data copied to clipboard!')),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Copy Sensitive Data'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a simple UI.
// 3. The UI consists of an AppBar and a Center widget containing an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the onPressed callback is triggered.
// 5. Inside the callback, the SensitiveClipboard.copy method is called to copy sensitive data to the clipboard.
// 6. The duration parameter specifies that the data should be cleared after 10 seconds.
// 7. A SnackBar is displayed to notify the user that the sensitive data has been copied.
// 8. After 10 seconds, the sensitive data is automatically cleared from the clipboard, enhancing security.
