# Tutorial: Setting Up Easy Autocomplete

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **easy_autocomplete** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the **easy_autocomplete** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  easy_autocomplete: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install Packages

Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable the use of Swift in your project. Open your `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode and ensure that the project settings are configured to support Swift.

## Step 4: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:easy_autocomplete/easy_autocomplete.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Autocomplete Widget

You can now use the `EasyAutocomplete` widget in your application. Here’s a simple example:

```dart
EasyAutocomplete(
  suggestions: ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry', 'Date', 'Fig', 'Grape'],
  onChanged: (value) {
    // Handle the change
  },
  decoration: InputDecoration(
    hintText: 'Type a fruit',
  ),
);
```

This widget will display suggestions based on the user’s input. You can customize the suggestions and the appearance of the input field as needed.

## Step 6: Additional Configurations

You can further customize the behavior of the autocomplete widget by using various properties such as `itemBuilder`, `onSuggestionSelected`, and more. Refer to the official documentation for more details.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the **easy_autocomplete** package into your Flutter application seamlessly.

# Complete Example of Easy Autocomplete

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:easy_autocomplete/easy_autocomplete.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Easy Autocomplete Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Easy Autocomplete Example'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: AutocompleteExample(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class AutocompleteExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _AutocompleteExampleState createState() => _AutocompleteExampleState();
}

class _AutocompleteExampleState extends State<AutocompleteExample> {
  // List of suggestions for the autocomplete
  final List<String> _fruits = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry', 'Date', 'Fig', 'Grape'];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        // EasyAutocomplete widget
        EasyAutocomplete(
          suggestions: _fruits, // Providing the list of suggestions
          onChanged: (value) {
            // Handle the change in input
            print('User input: $value');
          },
          onSuggestionSelected: (suggestion) {
            // Handle the selection of a suggestion
            print('Selected suggestion: $suggestion');
          },
          decoration: InputDecoration(
            hintText: 'Type a fruit',
            border: OutlineInputBorder(),
          ),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and body.
// 3. The AutocompleteExample widget is created, which contains a list of fruit suggestions.
// 4. The EasyAutocomplete widget is used to display suggestions based on user input.
// 5. As the user types, suggestions are filtered and displayed.
// 6. When a suggestion is selected, it is printed to the console.
```
