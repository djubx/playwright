# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using file_selector_android

## Installation
To use the `file_selector_android` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  file_selector_android: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/file_selector_android).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to read and write files. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

2. If your app targets Android 10 (API level 29) or higher, you may need to handle scoped storage. Refer to the official Android documentation for more details on how to manage file access.

### iOS
For iOS, you need to add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file to request permission to access files:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to select images.</string>
<key>NSDocumentsFolderUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your documents to select files.</string>
```

## Using the Package
To use the `file_selector_android` package, you can follow these steps in your Flutter application:

1. Import the package:

```dart
import 'package:file_selector/file_selector.dart';
```

2. Create a function to open the file selector:

```dart
Future<void> selectFile() async {
  // Define the file type you want to filter
  final XTypeGroup typeGroup = XTypeGroup(label: 'images', extensions: ['jpg', 'png']);
  
  // Open the file selector
  final XFile? file = await openFile(acceptedTypeGroups: [typeGroup]);
  
  if (file != null) {
    // Handle the selected file
    print('Selected file: ${file.name}');
  } else {
    print('No file selected.');
  }
}
```

3. Call the `selectFile` function from your UI, such as a button press.

This setup will allow you to integrate file selection capabilities into your Flutter application seamlessly.

# Complete Example of Using file_selector_android

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:file_selector/file_selector.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'File Selector Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('File Selector Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: selectFile, // Call the selectFile function when the button is pressed
            child: Text('Select a File'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to open the file selector
  Future<void> selectFile() async {
    // Define the file type you want to filter
    final XTypeGroup typeGroup = XTypeGroup(label: 'images', extensions: ['jpg', 'png']);
    
    // Open the file selector
    final XFile? file = await openFile(acceptedTypeGroups: [typeGroup]);
    
    if (file != null) {
      // Handle the selected file
      print('Selected file: ${file.name}');
    } else {
      print('No file selected.');
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the selectFile function is called.
// 5. The selectFile function opens the file selector, allowing the user to choose an image file.
// 6. If a file is selected, its name is printed to the console; otherwise, a message indicates no file was selected.
