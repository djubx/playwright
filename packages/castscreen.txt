# CastScreen Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the castscreen package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and include the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  castscreen: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/castscreen).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions for network access:
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
   ```

2. Add the following to your `MainActivity` to enable casting:
   ```java
   import io.flutter.embedding.android.FlutterActivity;

   public class MainActivity extends FlutterActivity {
       // Your code here
   }
   ```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file and add the following keys to request network permissions:
   ```xml
   <key>NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription</key>
   <string>This app requires access to local network devices for casting.</string>
   ```

## Basic Usage
Once the package is installed and configured, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement casting functionality:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:castscreen/castscreen.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Initialize the CastScreen instance
  final CastScreen _castScreen = CastScreen();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Start discovering devices
    _castScreen.startDiscovery();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Stop discovery when the widget is disposed
    _castScreen.stopDiscovery();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('CastScreen Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Start casting media
            _castScreen.castMedia('https://example.com/video.mp4');
          },
          child: Text('Cast Media'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application that discovers casting devices and allows users to cast media by pressing a button.

# Complete Example of CastScreen in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:castscreen/castscreen.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Create an instance of CastScreen
  final CastScreen _castScreen = CastScreen();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Start discovering available casting devices
    _castScreen.startDiscovery();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Stop device discovery when the widget is disposed
    _castScreen.stopDiscovery();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('CastScreen Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Start casting a media file when the button is pressed
            _castScreen.castMedia('https://example.com/video.mp4');
          },
          child: Text('Cast Media'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The RealFlutter widget is created, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 2. In the initState method, we start discovering casting devices using _castScreen.startDiscovery().
// 3. When the widget is disposed, we stop the discovery to free up resources.
// 4. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget containing an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the castMedia method is called with a media URL, initiating the casting process.
