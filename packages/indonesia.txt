# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the "indonesia" Package

## Installation
To use the "indonesia" package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  indonesia: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your app requires location services or other specific features.

## Basic Usage
To use the package, you can import it into your Dart files as follows:

```dart
import 'package:indonesia/indonesia.dart';
```

You can then access various features, such as retrieving a list of provinces or translating text.

### Example Usage
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the package to get a list of provinces:

```dart
void main() {
  // Fetching the list of provinces in Indonesia
  List<String> provinces = Indonesia.provinces;
  print(provinces); // Output the list of provinces
}
```

This will print the names of all provinces in Indonesia to the console.

# Complete Example of Using the "indonesia" Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:indonesia/indonesia.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Indonesia Package Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Indonesia Package Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ProvinceList(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class ProvinceList extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Fetching the list of provinces
    List<String> provinces = Indonesia.provinces;

    return ListView.builder(
      itemCount: provinces.length,
      itemBuilder: (context, index) {
        // Display each province in a ListTile
        return ListTile(
          title: Text(provinces[index]),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds the ProvinceList widget.
// 4. The ProvinceList widget fetches the list of provinces from the "indonesia" package.
// 5. A ListView.builder is used to create a scrollable list of provinces.
// 6. Each province is displayed in a ListTile, making it easy to read and interact with.
