# App Install Date Flutter Package

The `app_install_date` Flutter package is a simple yet powerful tool that allows developers to retrieve the installation date of their Flutter application. This can be particularly useful for analytics, user engagement tracking, or any feature that requires knowledge of when the app was first installed on a device.

## When to Use This Package

- **User Analytics**: Understanding how long users have had the app can help in tailoring user experiences based on their engagement duration.
- **Feature Rollouts**: You might want to enable certain features only for users who have had the app installed for a specific duration.
- **Support and Feedback**: Knowing the installation date can help in providing better support and understanding user feedback based on their experience timeline.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Simple API**: Easy to integrate and use within your Flutter application.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Fetches the installation date asynchronously, ensuring smooth user experience.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the App Install Date Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `app_install_date` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  app_install_date: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to ensure proper permissions (if needed):

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to the photo library.</string>
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:app_install_date/app_install_date.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the package to get the installation date. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to do this:

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized(); // Ensure Flutter is initialized
  DateTime installDate = await AppInstallDate.getInstallDate(); // Fetch install date
  print('App Install Date: $installDate'); // Print the install date
}
```

This code initializes the Flutter app, retrieves the installation date, and prints it to the console.

# Complete Example of Using the App Install Date Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:app_install_date/app_install_date.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized(); // Ensures that Flutter is initialized before running the app
  DateTime installDate = await AppInstallDate.getInstallDate(); // Fetch the installation date of the app
  runApp(MyApp(installDate: installDate)); // Pass the install date to the MyApp widget
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  final DateTime installDate; // Variable to hold the installation date

  MyApp({required this.installDate}); // Constructor to initialize the install date

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'App Install Date Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('App Install Date Example'), // App bar title
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(
            'App Install Date: ${installDate.toLocal()}', // Display the installation date
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20), // Text style
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. It ensures that Flutter is initialized using WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized().
// 3. The installation date is fetched asynchronously using AppInstallDate.getInstallDate().
// 4. The MyApp widget is created and the installation date is passed to it.
// 5. In the MyApp widget, the installation date is displayed in the center of the screen.
// 6. The app has a simple UI with an AppBar and a centered Text widget showing the installation date.
```
