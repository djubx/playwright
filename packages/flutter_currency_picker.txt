     showCurrencyPicker(
       context: context,
       showFlag: true, // Show country flag
       showCurrencyName: true, // Show currency name

         // Handle currency selection
         print('Selected currency: ${currency.name}');
       },
     );

# Complete Example of flutter_currency_picker

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Currency Picker Example',
      home: CurrencyPickerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class CurrencyPickerScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Currency Picker Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () => _showCurrencyPicker(context), // Call the currency picker
          child: Text('Select Currency'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Method to show the currency picker
  void _showCurrencyPicker(BuildContext context) {
    showCurrencyPicker(
      context: context,
      showFlag: true, // Show country flag
      showCurrencyName: true, // Show currency name
      onSelect: (Currency currency) {
        // Handle currency selection
        print('Selected currency: ${currency.name}'); // Print selected currency
        // You can also update the UI or state here based on the selected currency
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. CurrencyPickerScreen is displayed, which contains a button to select a currency.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the _showCurrencyPicker method is called.
// 5. The currency picker dialog appears, allowing the user to select a currency.
// 6. Upon selection, the selected currency is printed to the console, and you can update the UI accordingly.
