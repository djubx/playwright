# Tutorial: Setting Up flutter_pw_validator

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To use the `flutter_pw_validator` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_pw_validator: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install the Package

Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_pw_validator/flutter_pw_validator.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package

You can now use the `PasswordValidator` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it in a form:

```dart
PasswordValidator(
  controller: passwordController,
  minLength: 8,
  uppercaseCharCount: 1,
  numericCharCount: 1,
  specialCharCount: 1,
  onSuccess: () {
    // Password is valid
  },
  onFail: () {
    // Password is invalid
  },
)
```

This widget will validate the password based on the criteria you set and provide feedback to the user.

# Complete Example of flutter_pw_validator

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_pw_validator/flutter_pw_validator.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Password Validator Example',
      home: PasswordValidationScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PasswordValidationScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PasswordValidationScreenState createState() => _PasswordValidationScreenState();
}

class _PasswordValidationScreenState extends State<PasswordValidationScreen> {
  // Controller to manage the password input
  final TextEditingController passwordController = TextEditingController();
  bool isPasswordValid = false; // To track password validity

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Password Validator'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            // TextField for password input
            TextField(
              controller: passwordController,
              obscureText: true, // Hide password input
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Enter Password',
                border: OutlineInputBorder(),
              ),
              onChanged: (value) {
                // Validate password on change
                setState(() {
                  isPasswordValid = value.length >= 8; // Simple length check
                });
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Password Validator widget
            PasswordValidator(
              controller: passwordController,
              minLength: 8,
              uppercaseCharCount: 1,
              numericCharCount: 1,
              specialCharCount: 1,
              onSuccess: () {
                // If password is valid
                setState(() {
                  isPasswordValid = true;
                });
              },
              onFail: () {
                // If password is invalid
                setState(() {
                  isPasswordValid = false;
                });
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to submit the password
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: isPasswordValid
                  ? () {
                      // Handle successful password submission
                      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                        SnackBar(content: Text('Password is valid!')),
                      );
                    }
                  : null, // Disable button if password is invalid
              child: Text('Submit'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The PasswordValidationScreen is a stateful widget that manages the password input.
// 4. A TextField is provided for the user to enter their password, which is managed by a TextEditingController.
// 5. The PasswordValidator widget checks the password against specified criteria (length, uppercase, numeric, special characters).
// 6. The onSuccess and onFail callbacks update the isPasswordValid state variable based on the password's validity.
// 7. An ElevatedButton is provided to submit the password, which is only enabled if the password is valid.
// 8. When the button is pressed, a SnackBar is shown to indicate the password is valid.
