## When to Use

You might consider using the `animated_switch` package in scenarios such as:
- **Settings Pages**: Where users can toggle features on and off, such as notifications or dark mode.
- **Interactive Forms**: To allow users to switch between different input modes or options.
- **Game Settings**: For toggling game features like sound or difficulty levels.

## Features

- **Customizable Animations**: You can easily customize the animation duration and curve to fit your app's design.
- **State Management**: The package integrates well with Flutter's state management solutions, allowing for smooth transitions.
- **Accessibility**: The switches are designed to be accessible, ensuring that all users can interact with them.

Overall, the `animated_switch` package is an excellent choice for developers looking to add interactive and visually appealing toggle switches to their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Animated Switch

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `animated_switch` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  animated_switch: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:animated_switch/animated_switch.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

You can use the `AnimatedSwitch` widget in your Flutter app as follows:

```dart
AnimatedSwitch(
  value: isOn, // Boolean value to control the switch
  onChanged: (value) {
    setState(() {
      isOn = value; // Update the state when the switch is toggled
    });
  },
  // Customize the appearance
  activeColor: Colors.green,
  inactiveColor: Colors.red,
);
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` if your switch interacts with system features. However, for basic usage, no additional configuration is required.

## Optimizations

- **Performance**: Use the `AnimatedSwitch` within a `StatefulWidget` to manage its state efficiently.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure that the switch is labeled properly for screen readers by using the `semanticsLabel` property.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the `animated_switch` package into your Flutter application seamlessly.

# Complete Example of Animated Switch

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_switch/animated_switch.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animated Switch Example',
      home: AnimatedSwitchDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class AnimatedSwitchDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _AnimatedSwitchDemoState createState() => _AnimatedSwitchDemoState();
}

class _AnimatedSwitchDemoState extends State<AnimatedSwitchDemo> {
  // State variable to track the switch's status
  bool isOn = false;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Animated Switch Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // AnimatedSwitch widget
            AnimatedSwitch(
              value: isOn, // Current state of the switch
              onChanged: (value) {
                setState(() {
                  isOn = value; // Update the state when toggled
                });
              },
              activeColor: Colors.green, // Color when active
              inactiveColor: Colors.red, // Color when inactive
              // Optional: Customize the animation duration and curve
              duration: Duration(milliseconds: 300),
              curve: Curves.easeInOut,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Display the current state
            Text(
              isOn ? 'Switch is ON' : 'Switch is OFF',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets MyApp as the root widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and home set to AnimatedSwitchDemo.
// 3. AnimatedSwitchDemo is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the switch.
// 4. The state variable 'isOn' tracks whether the switch is on or off.
// 5. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 6. Inside the Center widget, an AnimatedSwitch is created, which takes the current state and a callback to update the state.
// 7. The switch's colors are set based on its state, and the animation duration and curve can be customized.
// 8. Below the switch, a Text widget displays the current state of the switch.
// 9. When the switch is toggled, the onChanged callback updates the 'isOn' state, triggering a rebuild to reflect the new state.
```
