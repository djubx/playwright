# Overview of the `dart_dependency_injection` Package

The `dart_dependency_injection` package is a powerful tool designed to facilitate dependency injection in Flutter applications. Dependency injection (DI) is a design pattern that allows for better separation of concerns, making your code more modular, testable, and maintainable. This package simplifies the process of managing dependencies, enabling developers to focus on building features rather than managing object lifecycles.

## When to Use This Package
- **Large Applications**: When building large applications with multiple services and repositories, DI helps manage dependencies efficiently.
- **Testing**: It allows for easier unit testing by enabling the injection of mock dependencies.
- **Modular Architecture**: If you are following a modular architecture, DI can help in managing the dependencies between modules.

## Key Features
- **Simple API**: The package provides a straightforward API for registering and resolving dependencies.
- **Scoped Instances**: You can create scoped instances that are only available within a specific context.
- **Lazy Loading**: Supports lazy loading of dependencies, which can improve performance by delaying the creation of instances until they are needed.
- **Singleton Support**: Easily manage singleton instances to ensure that only one instance of a class is created throughout the application.

Overall, `dart_dependency_injection` is an excellent choice for developers looking to implement dependency injection in their Flutter applications efficiently.

# Setting Up and Using the `dart_dependency_injection` Package

## Installation
To get started with the `dart_dependency_injection` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dart_dependency_injection: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/dart_dependency_injection).

## Platform-Specific Details
The `dart_dependency_injection` package is designed to work seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms. There are no specific configurations required for either platform, making it easy to integrate into your Flutter project.

## Basic Usage
1. **Create a Service Class**: Define the services that you want to inject.

```dart
class ApiService {
  String fetchData() {
    return "Data fetched from API";
  }
}
```

2. **Register the Service**: Use the `Injector` class to register your service.

```dart
import 'package:dart_dependency_injection/dart_dependency_injection.dart';

void main() {
  Injector.register<ApiService>(() => ApiService());
}
```

3. **Inject the Service**: You can now inject the service into your widgets or other classes.

```dart
class RealFlutter {
  final ApiService apiService;

  RealFlutter(this.apiService);

  void displayData() {
    print(apiService.fetchData());
  }
}
```

With these steps, you can easily set up and use the `dart_dependency_injection` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using `dart_dependency_injection`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dart_dependency_injection/dart_dependency_injection.dart';

// Define a service class that we will inject
class ApiService {
  String fetchData() {
    return "Data fetched from API";
  }
}

// Main application class
class RealFlutter {
  final ApiService apiService;

  // Constructor that takes the ApiService as a dependency
  RealFlutter(this.apiService);

  // Method to display data fetched from the API
  void displayData() {
    print(apiService.fetchData());
  }
}

void main() {
  // Register the ApiService with the Injector
  Injector.register<ApiService>(() => ApiService());

  // Run the Flutter application
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// Define the main application widget
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dependency Injection Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('DI Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Resolve the ApiService from the Injector
              final apiService = Injector.resolve<ApiService>();
              // Create an instance of RealFlutter with the resolved service
              final realFlutter = RealFlutter(apiService);
              // Display the fetched data
              realFlutter.displayData();
            },
            child: Text('Fetch Data'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function registers the ApiService with the Injector.
// 2. The MyApp widget is built, which contains a button.
// 3. When the button is pressed, the ApiService is resolved from the Injector.
// 4. An instance of RealFlutter is created with the resolved ApiService.
// 5. The displayData method is called, which fetches and prints the data from the API.
