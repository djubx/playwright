# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using aws_cloudwatch_api

## Installation
To get started with the `aws_cloudwatch_api` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  aws_cloudwatch_api: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/aws_cloudwatch_api).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

3. Add the AWS SDK dependencies in your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
implementation 'com.amazonaws:aws-android-sdk-core:latest_version'
implementation 'com.amazonaws:aws-android-sdk-cloudwatch:latest_version'
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

3. Ensure you have the necessary AWS SDK dependencies in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'AWSCore', '~> latest_version'
pod 'AWSCloudWatch', '~> latest_version'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `aws_cloudwatch_api` package, you need to initialize the AWS SDK and create an instance of the CloudWatch client. Here’s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:aws_cloudwatch_api/aws_cloudwatch_api.dart';

class RealFlutter {
  final CloudWatch cloudWatch;

  RealFlutter() : cloudWatch = CloudWatch(region: 'us-west-2');

  // Method to put a metric data point
  Future<void> putMetricData() async {
    final response = await cloudWatch.putMetricData(
      namespace: 'MyApp',
      metricData: [
        MetricDatum(
          metricName: 'PageLoadTime',
          value: 1.23,
          unit: StandardUnit.seconds,
        ),
      ],
    );
    print('Metric data sent: ${response}');
  }
}
```

This code initializes the CloudWatch client and sends a metric data point for page load time. 

With this setup, you can start monitoring your application using AWS CloudWatch.

# Complete Example of Using aws_cloudwatch_api

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:aws_cloudwatch_api/aws_cloudwatch_api.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'AWS CloudWatch Example',
      home: CloudWatchHome(),
    );
  }
}

class CloudWatchHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CloudWatchHomeState createState() => _CloudWatchHomeState();
}

class _CloudWatchHomeState extends State<CloudWatchHome> {
  final CloudWatch cloudWatch = CloudWatch(region: 'us-west-2');

  // Method to put a metric data point
  Future<void> putMetricData() async {
    try {
      // Sending metric data to CloudWatch
      final response = await cloudWatch.putMetricData(
        namespace: 'MyApp',
        metricData: [
          MetricDatum(
            metricName: 'PageLoadTime',
            value: 1.23, // Example value
            unit: StandardUnit.seconds,
          ),
        ],
      );
      // Print the response from CloudWatch
      print('Metric data sent: ${response}');
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during the API call
      print('Error sending metric data: $e');
    }
  }

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Call the method to send metric data when the app starts
    putMetricData();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('AWS CloudWatch Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Sending metrics to AWS CloudWatch...'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and home widget.
// 3. CloudWatchHome is a StatefulWidget that initializes the CloudWatch client.
// 4. In the initState method, putMetricData is called to send a metric to CloudWatch.
// 5. The putMetricData method sends a metric data point for 'PageLoadTime'.
// 6. The response from CloudWatch is printed to the console.
// 7. The UI displays a simple message indicating that metrics are being sent.
