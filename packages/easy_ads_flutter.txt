# Easy Ads Flutter Package

The **easy_ads_flutter** package is a powerful tool for integrating ads into your Flutter applications seamlessly. It provides a straightforward API for displaying ads from various ad networks, making it easier for developers to monetize their apps without diving deep into the complexities of each ad network's SDK.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the **easy_ads_flutter** package when:
- You want to monetize your Flutter app through ads.
- You need a simple and unified interface to manage ads from multiple ad networks.
- You want to save time on integrating and managing ads in your application.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS.
- **Multiple Ad Formats**: Supports banner ads, interstitial ads, and rewarded ads.

# Tutorial: Setting Up Easy Ads Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **easy_ads_flutter** package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the **easy_ads_flutter** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  easy_ads_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/easy_ads_flutter).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the necessary permissions and metadata for the ad networks you plan to use. For example, for AdMob, you would add:

```xml
<manifest>
    <application>
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.google.android.gms.ads.APPLICATION_ID"
            android:value="YOUR_ADMOB_APP_ID"/>
    </application>
</manifest>
```

Replace `YOUR_ADMOB_APP_ID` with your actual AdMob application ID.

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys for AdMob:

```xml
<key>GADApplicationIdentifier</key>
<string>YOUR_ADMOB_APP_ID</string>
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

Again, replace `YOUR_ADMOB_APP_ID` with your actual AdMob application ID.

## Step 3: Initialize the Package

In your main Dart file, initialize the **easy_ads_flutter** package. You can do this in the `main()` function:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:easy_ads_flutter/easy_ads_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  EasyAds.init(); // Initialize the Easy Ads package
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 4: Using Ads in Your App

You can now use the package to display ads. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to show a banner ad:

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Easy Ads Flutter Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              Text('Welcome to Easy Ads Flutter!'),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              BannerAdWidget(), // Displaying a banner ad
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Conclusion

You have now set up the **easy_ads_flutter** package in your Flutter application. You can further explore the package to implement interstitial and rewarded ads as needed.

# Complete Example of Easy Ads Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:easy_ads_flutter/easy_ads_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  EasyAds.init(); // Initialize the Easy Ads package
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the main application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Easy Ads Flutter Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              Text('Welcome to Easy Ads Flutter!'),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              BannerAdWidget(), // Displaying a banner ad
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  InterstitialAdWidget(); // Show interstitial ad on button press
                },
                child: Text('Show Interstitial Ad'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The app starts and initializes the Easy Ads package.
// 2. The main screen is displayed with a welcome message.
// 3. A banner ad is shown at the center of the screen.
// 4. When the user presses the "Show Interstitial Ad" button, an interstitial ad is displayed.
// 5. The user can interact with the ads, and the app continues to function normally.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

### Summary of Application Flow

The application starts by initializing the **easy_ads_flutter** package. It then displays a simple UI with a welcome message and a banner ad. When the user clicks the button, an interstitial ad is shown. This flow allows users to engage with ads while using the app, providing a monetization strategy for developers. The comments within the code explain each step of the process, making it easy to understand how the package integrates into a Flutter application.
