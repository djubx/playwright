# Overview of the seeip_client Flutter Package

The `seeip_client` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to retrieve and display the public IP address of a device. This package is particularly useful in applications that require network information, such as VPN clients, network monitoring tools, or any app that needs to display the user's public IP for configuration or troubleshooting purposes.

## Key Features
- **Simple API**: The package provides a straightforward API to fetch the public IP address with minimal setup.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in error handling to manage network issues gracefully.
- **Lightweight**: The package is lightweight, ensuring that it does not bloat your application.

## When to Use
You might consider using the `seeip_client` package in scenarios such as:
- Developing a network utility app that displays the user's public IP.
- Creating a VPN application that needs to show the current IP address.
- Building a troubleshooting tool for network configurations.

Overall, `seeip_client` is an excellent choice for any Flutter application that requires access to the device's public IP address.

# Setting Up and Using seeip_client

## Installation
To add the `seeip_client` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  seeip_client: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/seeip_client).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to access the internet. Add the following line within the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add the following key to your `Info.plist` file to allow network requests:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `seeip_client` package, you can create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class and call the method to fetch the public IP address. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:seeip_client/seeip_client.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _ipAddress = 'Fetching...';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _fetchIPAddress();
  }

  Future<void> _fetchIPAddress() async {
    try {
      final ip = await SeeIpClient.getPublicIP();
      setState(() {
        _ipAddress = ip;
      });
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        _ipAddress = 'Error fetching IP';
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Public IP Address')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Your IP: $_ipAddress')),
    );
  }
}
```

This code initializes the app, fetches the public IP address, and displays it on the screen.

# Complete Example of seeip_client in a Flutter App

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:seeip_client/seeip_client.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'See IP Client Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _ipAddress = 'Fetching...'; // Variable to hold the IP address

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _fetchIPAddress(); // Fetch the IP address when the widget is initialized
  }

  Future<void> _fetchIPAddress() async {
    try {
      // Attempt to get the public IP address
      final ip = await SeeIpClient.getPublicIP();
      setState(() {
        _ipAddress = ip; // Update the state with the fetched IP address
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during the fetch
      setState(() {
        _ipAddress = 'Error fetching IP'; // Update state to show error message
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Public IP Address')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Your IP: $_ipAddress'), // Display the IP address
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that initializes the state and fetches the IP address in initState.
// 4. The _fetchIPAddress method is called, which attempts to get the public IP using SeeIpClient.
// 5. If successful, the IP address is displayed; if an error occurs, an error message is shown.
// 6. The UI updates automatically when the state changes, reflecting the fetched IP address or error message.
