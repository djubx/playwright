```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:refena_flutter/refena_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  RefenaFlutter.initialize();
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Initialize the RefenaFlutter package
  final RefenaFlutter _refenaFlutter = RefenaFlutter();

  // Define a function to make an API call using RefenaFlutter
  Future<void> _makeApiCall() async {
    // Use RefenaFlutter's networking features to make an API call
    final response = await _refenaFlutter.get('https://api.example.com/data');

    // Handle the response
    if (response.statusCode == 200) {
      print('API call successful!');
    } else {
      print('API call failed!');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'RealFlutter',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('RealFlutter'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: _makeApiCall,
            child: Text('Make API Call'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The app starts by initializing the RefenaFlutter package
// Then, it runs the RealFlutter app
// When the user presses the button, it makes an API call using RefenaFlutter's networking features
// The response is then handled and printed to the console

// Final summary: This code demonstrates how to use the RefenaFlutter package to make an API call
// It initializes the package, defines a function to make the API call, and handles the response
