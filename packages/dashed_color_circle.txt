# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Dashed Color Circle

## Installation
To use the dashed_color_circle package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  dashed_color_circle: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/dashed_color_circle).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Usage
Once the package is installed, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below are the steps to implement the Dashed Color Circle widget.

### Import the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:dashed_color_circle/dashed_color_circle.dart';
```

### Basic Implementation
You can create a Dashed Color Circle by using the `DashedColorCircle` widget. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
DashedColorCircle(
  color: Colors.blue, // Color of the dashes
  backgroundColor: Colors.grey[200], // Background color
  dashLength: 10.0, // Length of each dash
  dashThickness: 2.0, // Thickness of each dash
  circleSize: 100.0, // Size of the circle
  value: 0.75, // Progress value (0.0 to 1.0)
),
```

### Platform-Specific Details
- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid compatibility issues.
- **iOS**: No specific configurations are required, but ensure you have the latest version of Xcode for optimal performance.

### Optimizations
- Use the `value` parameter to dynamically update the progress based on your application logic.
- Customize the `dashLength` and `dashThickness` to match your app's design language.

With these steps, you can easily integrate the dashed_color_circle package into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Dashed Color Circle

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dashed_color_circle/dashed_color_circle.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dashed Color Circle Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Dashed Color Circle Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: DashedColorCircle(
            color: Colors.blue, // Set the color of the dashes
            backgroundColor: Colors.grey[200], // Set the background color
            dashLength: 10.0, // Length of each dash
            dashThickness: 2.0, // Thickness of each dash
            circleSize: 100.0, // Size of the circle
            value: 0.75, // Progress value (0.0 to 1.0)
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, we place the DashedColorCircle widget.
// 5. The DashedColorCircle is configured with colors, dash length, thickness, size, and a progress value.
// 6. The app displays a circular progress indicator with a dashed outline in the center of the screen.
