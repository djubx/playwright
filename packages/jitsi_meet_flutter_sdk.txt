# Tutorial: Setting Up Jitsi Meet Flutter SDK

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `jitsi_meet_flutter_sdk` package and explain how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `jitsi_meet_flutter_sdk` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  jitsi_meet_flutter_sdk: ^2.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update Android Manifest**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
   ```

2. **Enable ProGuard**: If you are using ProGuard, make sure to add the following rules to `proguard-rules.pro`:

   ```pro
   -keep class org.jitsi.** { *; }
   -keep class org.jitsi.meet.** { *; }
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request camera and microphone permissions:

   ```xml
   <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your camera for video calls.</string>
   <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your microphone for audio during calls.</string>
   ```

2. **Enable Background Modes**: In Xcode, go to your project settings, select the "Capabilities" tab, and enable "Background Modes". Check "Audio, AirPlay, and Picture in Picture".

## Step 3: Initialize and Use the SDK

Now that we have configured the package, we can initialize and use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to do this.

# Complete Example: Jitsi Meet Flutter SDK

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:jitsi_meet/jitsi_meet.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Jitsi Meet Example',
      home: MeetingPage(),
    );
  }
}

class MeetingPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MeetingPageState createState() => _MeetingPageState();
}

class _MeetingPageState extends State<MeetingPage> {
  // Function to join a meeting
  void joinMeeting() async {
    // Define meeting options
    var options = JitsiMeetingOptions(room: "exampleRoom")
      ..userDisplayName = "User Name" // Set the user's display name
      ..userEmail = "user@example.com" // Set the user's email
      ..userAvatarURL = "https://example.com/avatar.png" // Set the user's avatar
      ..audioMuted = false // Mute audio on join
      ..videoMuted = false; // Mute video on join

    // Join the meeting
    await JitsiMeet.joinMeeting(options);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Jitsi Meet Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: joinMeeting, // Call joinMeeting when button is pressed
          child: Text('Join Meeting'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home page.
// 3. The MeetingPage is a StatefulWidget that manages the meeting state.
// 4. When the user presses the "Join Meeting" button, the joinMeeting function is called.
// 5. The joinMeeting function creates a JitsiMeetingOptions object with the meeting details.
// 6. Finally, it calls JitsiMeet.joinMeeting to start the meeting with the specified options.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application that allows users to join a Jitsi Meet video conference. The application flow is straightforward:

1. The app starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` widget.
2. `RealFlutter` is a `StatelessWidget` that builds a `MaterialApp` with a title and a home page.
3. The `MeetingPage` is a `StatefulWidget` that manages the meeting state.
4. When the user presses the "Join Meeting" button, the `joinMeeting` function is called.
5. The `joinMeeting` function creates a `JitsiMeetingOptions` object with the meeting details.
6. Finally, it calls `JitsiMeet.joinMeeting` to start the meeting with the specified options.

This setup provides a solid foundation for integrating video conferencing into your Flutter applications using the `jitsi_meet_flutter_sdk`.
