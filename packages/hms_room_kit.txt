# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using HMS Room Kit

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `hms_room_kit` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `hms_room_kit` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  hms_room_kit: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/hms_room_kit).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
```

3. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request permissions for camera and microphone access:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera for video calls.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio calls.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple Flutter application that utilizes the `hms_room_kit`.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:hms_room_kit/hms_room_kit.dart';
```

2. Initialize the `HMSRoomKit` and set up the necessary callbacks for handling events such as user joining, leaving, and stream updates.

3. Create a UI to display the video streams and controls for the user.

This setup will allow you to create a basic video conferencing application using the `hms_room_kit` package.

# Complete Example of HMS Room Kit

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:hms_room_kit/hms_room_kit.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'HMS Room Kit Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RoomScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class RoomScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RoomScreenState createState() => _RoomScreenState();
}

class _RoomScreenState extends State<RoomScreen> {
  late HMSRoomKit hmsRoomKit; // Declare the HMSRoomKit instance
  late String roomId; // Room ID for the session
  late String userId; // User ID for the participant

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    hmsRoomKit = HMSRoomKit(); // Initialize the HMSRoomKit
    roomId = "your_room_id"; // Replace with your room ID
    userId = "your_user_id"; // Replace with your user ID
    joinRoom(); // Call the method to join the room
  }

  // Method to join the room
  void joinRoom() async {
    try {
      await hmsRoomKit.join(roomId: roomId, userId: userId);
      // Successfully joined the room
    } catch (e) {
      print("Error joining room: $e");
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('HMS Room Kit Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to the Room!'),
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    hmsRoomKit.leave(); // Leave the room when the widget is disposed
    super.dispose();
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme, and sets RoomScreen as the home.
// 3. RoomScreen initializes the HMSRoomKit instance and sets the room and user IDs.
// 4. In the initState method, it calls joinRoom to attempt to join the specified room.
// 5. If successful, the user is welcomed in the body of the Scaffold.
// 6. When the RoomScreen widget is disposed, it calls leave on the hmsRoomKit instance to clean up.
```
