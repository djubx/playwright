## Setup Process

To get started with the `typicons_flutter` package, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `typicons_flutter` package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     typicons_flutter: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
   ```

2. **Install the Package**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: No additional configuration is required for Android. The package works out of the box.
   - **iOS**: Ensure that your iOS deployment target is set to at least 9.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

     ```ruby
     platform :ios, '9.0'
     ```

4. **Import the Package**: In your Dart files, import the package to start using it:

   ```dart

   ```

## Using the Package

To use the icons in your Flutter application, you can simply call the `Typicons` class and specify the icon you want to use. Here’s a basic example:

```dart
Icon(Typicons.home, size: 30, color: Colors.blue);
```

You can customize the size and color of the icons as needed. The `Typicons` class provides access to all the icons available in the Typicons set.

### Example Usage in a Widget

Here’s how you can use the `typicons_flutter` package in a simple Flutter widget:

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Column(
    children: [
      Icon(Typicons.home, size: 50, color: Colors.green),
      Icon(Typicons.user, size: 50, color: Colors.red),
    ],
  );
}
```

This will display two icons, a home icon and a user icon, with specified sizes and colors.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:typicons_flutter/typicons_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Typicons Flutter Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Typicons Flutter Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Displaying a home icon
              Icon(Typicons.home, size: 100, color: Colors.blue),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              // Displaying a user icon
              Icon(Typicons.user, size: 100, color: Colors.green),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              // Displaying a settings icon
              Icon(Typicons.cog, size: 100, color: Colors.red),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the icons vertically.
// Each icon is created using the Icon widget, specifying the Typicons icon, size, and color.
// SizedBox is used to add spacing between the icons for better visual separation.
// The app displays three icons: home, user, and settings, each with different colors and sizes.
```
<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, the application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` widget. The `RealFlutter` widget is a `StatelessWidget` that builds a `MaterialApp`. The `MaterialApp` contains a `Scaffold` with an `AppBar` and a `Center` widget. Inside the `Center` widget, a `Column` is used to arrange the icons vertically. Each icon is created using the `Icon` widget, specifying the Typicons icon, size, and color. `SizedBox` is used to add spacing between the icons for better visual separation. The app displays three icons: home, user, and settings, each with different colors and sizes.

In summary, the `typicons_flutter` package provides a simple and effective way to integrate high-quality icons into your Flutter applications, enhancing the overall user experience.
