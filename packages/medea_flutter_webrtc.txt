# Setting Up and Using `medea_flutter_webrtc`

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `medea_flutter_webrtc` package and provide platform-specific details for both Android and iOS.

## Installation

To add the `medea_flutter_webrtc` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  medea_flutter_webrtc: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/medea_flutter_webrtc).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure that you have the following configurations:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       compileSdkVersion 31 // or latest
       ...
   }
   ```

2. In the same file, add the following permissions:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21 // or higher
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

3. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
   ```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following keys to request permissions:
   ```xml
   <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your camera for video calls.</string>
   <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your microphone for audio calls.</string>
   ```

2. Ensure that your iOS deployment target is set to at least 11.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:
   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '11.0'
   ```

## Basic Usage

After setting up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Here’s a simple example of how to initialize a WebRTC connection.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:medea_flutter_webrtc/medea_flutter_webrtc.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Initialize the WebRTC client
  late final MedeaWebRTCClient _client;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _client = MedeaWebRTCClient();
    // Additional setup can be done here
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('WebRTC Example')),
      body: Center(child: Text('WebRTC is set up!')),
    );
  }
}
```

This code initializes a WebRTC client and sets up a basic Flutter application structure. You can expand upon this by adding more functionalities such as handling video streams and managing connections.

# Complete Example of `medea_flutter_webrtc`

Here’s a fully functional example of a Flutter application using the `medea_flutter_webrtc` package. This example demonstrates how to set up a simple video call interface.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:medea_flutter_webrtc/medea_flutter_webrtc.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Declare the WebRTC client and local stream
  late final MedeaWebRTCClient _client;
  MediaStream? _localStream;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _client = MedeaWebRTCClient();
    _initializeWebRTC();
  }

  // Initialize WebRTC and get local media stream
  Future<void> _initializeWebRTC() async {
    // Request permissions for camera and microphone
    await _client.requestPermissions();
    
    // Get the local media stream
    _localStream = await _client.getUserMedia({
      'audio': true,
      'video': true,
    });

    // Add local stream to the client
    _client.addStream(_localStream!);
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Clean up resources
    _localStream?.dispose();
    _client.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('WebRTC Video Call')),
      body: Center(
        child: _localStream != null
            ? RTCVideoView(_localStream!.getVideoTracks().first)
            : CircularProgressIndicator(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The RealFlutter widget is created, initializing the WebRTC client.
// 2. In the initState method, we call _initializeWebRTC to set up the local media stream.
// 3. The _initializeWebRTC method requests permissions for the camera and microphone.
// 4. It then retrieves the local media stream and adds it to the WebRTC client.
// 5. In the build method, we check if the local stream is available. If it is, we display the video feed; otherwise, we show a loading indicator.
// 6. Finally, we clean up resources in the dispose method to prevent memory leaks.
```
