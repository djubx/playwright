# Feedback Sentry Flutter Package

The **Feedback Sentry** package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers to collect user feedback seamlessly within their applications. It provides a simple and effective way to gather insights from users, which can be invaluable for improving app performance and user experience.

## When to Use Feedback Sentry

You should consider using the Feedback Sentry package in scenarios such as:

- **User Testing**: When you want to gather feedback from users during beta testing phases.
- **Post-Launch Feedback**: To collect user opinions and suggestions after the app has been launched.
- **Bug Reporting**: Allow users to report bugs directly from the app, making it easier to track issues.

## Features

- **Customizable Feedback Forms**: Create tailored feedback forms that suit your app's needs.
- **Real-time Feedback Collection**: Users can submit feedback in real-time, allowing for immediate insights.
- **Integration with Analytics**: Easily integrate with analytics tools to track user feedback alongside other metrics.

# Tutorial: Setting Up Feedback Sentry

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the Feedback Sentry package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the Feedback Sentry package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  feedback_sentry: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the internet permission in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using Feedback Sentry

Now that we have set up the package, let's implement it in our Flutter application.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:feedback_sentry/feedback_sentry.dart';
```

2. Initialize the Feedback Sentry in your main application file:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
  FeedbackSentry.initialize();
}
```

3. Create a feedback form and display it when needed:

```dart
void showFeedbackForm() {
  FeedbackSentry.showFeedbackForm();
}
```

You can call `showFeedbackForm()` from a button or any other UI element to allow users to submit their feedback.

# Complete Example of Feedback Sentry

Hereâ€™s a complete example of a Flutter application using the Feedback Sentry package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:feedback_sentry/feedback_sentry.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
  FeedbackSentry.initialize(); // Initialize Feedback Sentry
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Feedback Sentry Example',
      home: FeedbackHome(),
    );
  }
}

class FeedbackHome extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Feedback Sentry Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            showFeedbackForm(); // Show feedback form when button is pressed
          },
          child: Text('Give Feedback'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void showFeedbackForm() {
    FeedbackSentry.showFeedbackForm(); // Call to display the feedback form
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which initializes the Feedback Sentry.
// 2. The RealFlutter class builds the main MaterialApp.
// 3. The FeedbackHome widget is displayed, containing a button.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the showFeedbackForm method is called.
// 5. This method triggers the Feedback Sentry feedback form, allowing users to submit their feedback.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

## Summary of Application Flow

The application begins execution in the `main` function, where the `FeedbackSentry` is initialized. The `RealFlutter` class sets up the main user interface, which consists of a simple button. When the user taps the button, the `showFeedbackForm` method is invoked, displaying the feedback form provided by the Feedback Sentry package. This flow allows users to easily submit their feedback, enhancing the app's ability to gather user insights effectively.
