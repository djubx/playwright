# Complete Example of Using iso_calendar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:iso_calendar/iso_calendar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'ISO Calendar Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('ISO Calendar Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: IsoCalendarExample(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class IsoCalendarExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Get today's date in ISO format
    final today = IsoDateTime.now();
    
    // Get the week number and year
    final weekNumber = today.weekNumber;
    final year = today.year;

    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Text('Today: ${today.toIso8601String()}'),
        Text('Week Number: $weekNumber'),
        Text('Year: $year'),
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Add 7 days to today's date
            final nextWeek = today.add(Duration(days: 7));
            showDialog(
              context: context,
              builder: (context) {
                return AlertDialog(
                  title: Text('Next Week'),
                  content: Text('Date: ${nextWeek.toIso8601String()}'),
                  actions: [
                    TextButton(
                      onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                      child: Text('Close'),
                    ),
                  ],
                );
              },
            );
          },
          child: Text('Add 7 Days'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. The IsoCalendarExample widget is displayed in the center of the screen.
// 4. Inside IsoCalendarExample, the current date is fetched in ISO format, along with the week number and year.
// 5. These values are displayed as text on the screen.
// 6. An ElevatedButton is provided to add 7 days to the current date.
// 7. When the button is pressed, a dialog shows the date one week from today.
// 8. The user can close the dialog to return to the main screen.
