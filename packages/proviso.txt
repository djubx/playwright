Here's a detailed technical blog on the "proviso" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Proviso Flutter Package

The **Proviso** package is a powerful tool for managing conditional rendering and state management in Flutter applications. It allows developers to define conditions under which certain widgets should be displayed, making it easier to create dynamic user interfaces that respond to user input or application state.

## When to Use Proviso

You might consider using the Proviso package in scenarios such as:
- **Dynamic Forms**: When building forms that change based on user input, such as showing additional fields when a specific option is selected.
- **Feature Toggles**: To enable or disable features in your app based on user roles or preferences.
- **Conditional Navigation**: When navigating between screens based on certain conditions, such as user authentication status.

## Features
- **Simple Syntax**: The package provides a straightforward API for defining conditions and rendering widgets.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Proviso ensures that only the necessary widgets are rebuilt when conditions change, improving performance.
- **Support for Multiple Conditions**: You can easily combine multiple conditions to control widget visibility.

In summary, Proviso is an excellent choice for Flutter developers looking to implement conditional rendering in a clean and efficient manner.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Proviso

## Step 1: Adding Proviso to Your Project

To get started with the Proviso package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  proviso: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, make sure your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using Proviso in Your Flutter App

Now that you have set up the Proviso package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use Proviso to conditionally render widgets based on a boolean value.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:proviso/proviso.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    bool isVisible = true; // This condition can be changed based on your logic

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Proviso Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Proviso(
            condition: isVisible,
            then: Text('This text is visible!'),
            elseWidget: Text('This text is hidden!'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, the `Proviso` widget checks the `isVisible` condition. If `isVisible` is true, it displays "This text is visible!", otherwise it shows "This text is hidden!".

# Complete Example of Proviso in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:proviso/proviso.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // State variable to control visibility
  bool isVisible = true;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Proviso Example'),
          actions: [
            // Button to toggle visibility
            IconButton(
              icon: Icon(Icons.visibility),
              onPressed: () {
                // Toggle the visibility state
                setState(() {
                  isVisible = !isVisible;
                });
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Proviso(
            condition: isVisible,
            then: Text('This text is visible!'), // Widget shown when condition is true
            elseWidget: Text('This text is hidden!'), // Widget shown when condition is false
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains a boolean state variable 'isVisible'.
// 3. The AppBar contains an IconButton that toggles the 'isVisible' state when pressed.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold uses the Proviso widget to conditionally render text based on the 'isVisible' state.
// 5. When 'isVisible' is true, "This text is visible!" is displayed; otherwise, "This text is hidden!" is shown.
// 6. The UI updates dynamically when the button is pressed, demonstrating the conditional rendering capabilities of the Proviso package.
```
