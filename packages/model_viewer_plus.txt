# Overview of the `model_viewer_plus` Flutter Package

The `model_viewer_plus` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to integrate 3D model viewing capabilities into their applications. This package is a Flutter plugin that allows you to display and interact with 3D models directly within your app using the `<model-viewer>` web component. It is particularly useful for applications in e-commerce, education, and gaming, where 3D visualization can enhance user experience.

## When to Use `model_viewer_plus`

- **E-commerce**: Display 3D models of products to give customers a better understanding of the product's appearance and features.
- **Education**: Visualize complex structures or historical artifacts in 3D to provide an interactive learning experience.
- **Gaming**: Showcase 3D characters or environments as part of game development.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Interactive Controls**: Users can rotate, zoom, and pan the 3D models.
- **Augmented Reality (AR)**: Supports AR viewing on compatible devices.
- **Customizable**: Offers various customization options for lighting, camera angles, and more.

# Setting Up and Using `model_viewer_plus` in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for integrating the `model_viewer_plus` package into a Flutter application. We will cover platform-specific configurations for both Android and iOS.

## Setup Process

### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the `model_viewer_plus` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  model_viewer_plus: ^2.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 19:

```gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 19
    }
}
```

### Step 3: iOS Configuration

For iOS, ensure that your `Info.plist` file includes the following entry to allow AR capabilities:

```xml
<key>io.flutter.embedded_views_preview</key>
<true/>
```

### Step 4: Import and Use the Package

Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:model_viewer_plus/model_viewer_plus.dart';
```

# Complete Example of Using `model_viewer_plus`

Below is a complete example of a Flutter application using the `model_viewer_plus` package. This example demonstrates how to display a 3D model and interact with it.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:model_viewer_plus/model_viewer_plus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: '3D Model Viewer',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: ModelViewerPage(),
    );
  }
}

class ModelViewerPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('3D Model Viewer'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ModelViewer(
          src: 'https://modelviewer.dev/shared-assets/models/Astronaut.glb', // URL to the 3D model
          alt: "A 3D model of an astronaut", // Alternative text for the model
          ar: true, // Enable AR mode
          autoRotate: true, // Automatically rotate the model
          cameraControls: true, // Enable camera controls
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// Application Flow Explanation
// 1. The `main` function initializes the app by running the `RealFlutter` widget.
// 2. `RealFlutter` is a stateless widget that sets up the `MaterialApp` with a title and theme.
// 3. The home of the app is set to `ModelViewerPage`, which is another stateless widget.
// 4. `ModelViewerPage` builds a `Scaffold` with an `AppBar` and a `Center` widget.
// 5. Inside the `Center` widget, the `ModelViewer` widget is used to display the 3D model.
// 6. The `ModelViewer` widget is configured with a source URL for the 3D model, alternative text, and options for AR, auto-rotation, and camera controls.
