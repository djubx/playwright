Here's a detailed technical blog on the "object_mapper" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Object Mapper Flutter Package

The `object_mapper` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that simplifies the process of converting between different object types. This package is particularly useful when dealing with data transfer objects (DTOs) and models, allowing for seamless mapping between them. 

## When to Use

You might consider using the `object_mapper` package in scenarios such as:
- **API Integration**: When fetching data from an API, you often need to convert JSON responses into Dart objects. The `object_mapper` package can automate this process.
- **Data Persistence**: When saving and retrieving data from local storage, you may need to map between your data models and the storage format.
- **Complex Object Structures**: If your application has complex object hierarchies, the package can help manage the mapping between these structures efficiently.

## Features
- **Automatic Mapping**: Automatically maps properties between source and destination objects based on naming conventions.
- **Custom Mapping**: Allows for custom mapping logic when property names differ or require transformation.
- **Nested Object Mapping**: Supports mapping of nested objects, making it easier to handle complex data structures.
- **Type Safety**: Ensures type safety during the mapping process, reducing runtime errors.

By leveraging the `object_mapper` package, developers can save time and reduce boilerplate code, leading to cleaner and more maintainable codebases.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Object Mapper

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `object_mapper` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  object_mapper: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, ensure that your `ios/Podfile` has the platform version set to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

### Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:object_mapper/object_mapper.dart';
```

### Creating Your Models

Define your data models. For example, let's create a simple `User` model:

```dart
class User {
  String name;
  int age;

  User({required this.name, required this.age});
}
```

### Mapping Example

You can now use the `object_mapper` to map between different object types. Hereâ€™s a simple example of mapping a JSON object to a `User` model:

```dart
void main() {
  // Sample JSON data
  final jsonData = {
    'name': 'John Doe',
    'age': 30,
  };

  // Mapping JSON to User object
  final user = ObjectMapper.fromJson<User>(jsonData, User.fromJson);
  print('User Name: ${user.name}, Age: ${user.age}');
}
```

### Custom Mapping

If your JSON keys differ from your model properties, you can define custom mapping logic:

```dart
class User {
  String fullName;
  int yearsOld;

  User({required this.fullName, required this.yearsOld});

  // Custom fromJson method
  factory User.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) {
    return User(
      fullName: json['name'],
      yearsOld: json['age'],
    );
  }
}
```

Now you can map the JSON to the `User` model using the custom `fromJson` method.

# Complete Example of Object Mapper in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:object_mapper/object_mapper.dart';

// Define the User model
class User {
  String name;
  int age;

  User({required this.name, required this.age});

  // Factory constructor for creating a User from JSON
  factory User.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) {
    return User(
      name: json['name'],
      age: json['age'],
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Object Mapper Example',
      home: UserScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class UserScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample JSON data
    final jsonData = {
      'name': 'John Doe',
      'age': 30,
    };

    // Mapping JSON to User object
    final user = ObjectMapper.fromJson<User>(jsonData, User.fromJson);

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('User Information'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('User Name: ${user.name}, Age: ${user.age}'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (UserScreen).
// 3. UserScreen contains a sample JSON object representing user data.
// 4. The JSON data is mapped to a User object using ObjectMapper.fromJson().
// 5. The user information is displayed in the center of the screen using a Text widget.
```

In this example, we demonstrated how to set up and use the `object_mapper` package in a Flutter application. The application fetches user data from a JSON object, maps it to a `User` model, and displays the user's name and age on the screen. 

### Summary of Application Flow
- The application starts with the `main()` function, which initializes the Flutter app.
- The `MyApp` widget sets up the main structure of the app, including the title and home screen.
- The `UserScreen` widget handles the mapping of JSON data to the `User` model and displays the information.
- The use of the `object_mapper` package simplifies the mapping process, allowing for clean and maintainable code.
