# Setting Up and Using the Package
=====================================

## Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

To use the `masamune_universal_ui` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. You can do this by adding the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  masamune_universal_ui: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Import the Package

To use the package in your Dart files, you need to import it. Add the following line at the top of your file:

```dart
import 'package:masamune_universal_ui/masamune_universal_ui.dart';
```

## Step 3: Use the Package

Now you can use the package's UI components and layout system to build your application's UI. Here's an example of how to use the `UniversalButton` component:

```dart
UniversalButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // Handle button press
  },
  child: Text('Click me'),
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details

The `masamune_universal_ui` package is designed to work seamlessly across multiple platforms, including Android, iOS, and web. However, there are some platform-specific details to keep in mind:

    ```xml
<application
  ...
  android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"
  ...>
```

    This allows the package to use cleartext traffic, which is required for some of its features.

*   **iOS:** To use the package on iOS, you need to add the following line to your `Info.plist` file:

    ```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>

    This allows the package to use arbitrary loads, which is required for some of its features.

          UniversalButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Handle button press
            },
            child: Text('Click me'),
          ),
          // Create a new UniversalTextField instance
          UniversalTextField(
            onChanged: (text) {
              // Handle text change
            },
            decoration: InputDecoration(
              labelText: 'Enter your name',
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the application.
// 2. The application creates a new UniversalUI instance.
// 3. The UniversalUI instance sets the theme and styling options.
// 4. The UniversalUI instance sets the layout system.
// 5. The layout system creates a new row.
// 6. The row contains a new UniversalButton instance and a new UniversalTextField instance.
// 7. The user can interact with the UniversalButton and UniversalTextField instances.
// 8. The application handles the user's interactions and updates the UI accordingly.

// In summary, the code flows as follows:
// 1. The application creates a new UniversalUI instance.
// 2. The UniversalUI instance sets the theme and styling options.
// 3. The UniversalUI instance sets the layout system.
// 4. The layout system creates a new row.
// 5. The row contains a new UniversalButton instance and a new UniversalTextField instance.
// 6. The user can interact with the UniversalButton and UniversalTextField instances.
// 7. The application handles the user's interactions and updates the UI accordingly.
