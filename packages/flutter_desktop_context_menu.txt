# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_desktop_context_menu

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_desktop_context_menu` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Package to Your Project
To get started, you need to add the `flutter_desktop_context_menu` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_desktop_context_menu: ^0.1.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Windows
For Windows, ensure that your project is set up to support desktop applications. You may need to enable desktop support if you haven't done so already:

```bash
flutter config --enable-windows-desktop
```

### macOS
For macOS, ensure you have the necessary permissions set in your `Info.plist` file to allow context menus to function correctly.

### Linux
For Linux, ensure that you have the required libraries installed for context menus to work properly.

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that the package is installed and configured, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to create a context menu.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_desktop_context_menu/flutter_desktop_context_menu.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Context Menu Example',
      home: ContextMenuDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class ContextMenuDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ContextMenuDemoState createState() => _ContextMenuDemoState();
}

class _ContextMenuDemoState extends State<ContextMenuDemo> {
  // This method will be called when a menu item is selected
  void _onMenuItemSelected(String value) {
    // Display a snackbar with the selected menu item
    ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
      SnackBar(content: Text('Selected: $value')),
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Context Menu Demo')),
      body: Center(
        child: GestureDetector(
          // Detect right-click to show context menu
          onSecondaryTap: () {
            // Create a context menu with items
            final contextMenu = ContextMenu(
              items: [
                ContextMenuItem(
                  label: 'Option 1',
                  onPressed: () => _onMenuItemSelected('Option 1'),
                ),
                ContextMenuItem(
                  label: 'Option 2',
                  onPressed: () => _onMenuItemSelected('Option 2'),
                ),
                ContextMenuItem(
                  label: 'Option 3',
                  onPressed: () => _onMenuItemSelected('Option 3'),
                ),
              ],
            );

            // Show the context menu at the current position
            contextMenu.show(context);
          },
          child: Container(
            padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
            color: Colors.blueAccent,
            child: Text(
              'Right-click me!',
              style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget (ContextMenuDemo).
// 3. ContextMenuDemo is a stateful widget that contains a GestureDetector.
// 4. The GestureDetector listens for a right-click (onSecondaryTap) event.
// 5. When the right-click is detected, a context menu is created with three options.
// 6. Each menu item has an onPressed callback that triggers the _onMenuItemSelected method.
// 7. The selected option is displayed in a snackbar at the bottom of the screen.
