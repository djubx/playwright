```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

## Step 5: Using the Smooth Star Rating Widget
You can now use the `SmoothStarRating` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
SmoothStarRating(
  allowHalfRating: false,
  onRated: (value) {
    print("Rating value: $value");
  },
  starCount: 5,
  rating: 3,
  size: 40.0,
  isReadOnly: false,
  color: Colors.yellow,
  borderColor: Colors.yellow,
  spacing: 0.0,

# Complete Example of Smooth Star Rating Nsafe

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:smooth_star_rating_nsafe/smooth_star_rating_nsafe.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Smooth Star Rating Example',
      home: RatingPage(),
    );
  }
}

class RatingPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RatingPageState createState() => _RatingPageState();
}

class _RatingPageState extends State<RatingPage> {
  double rating = 3; // Initial rating value

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Smooth Star Rating Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display the SmoothStarRating widget
            SmoothStarRating(
              allowHalfRating: false, // Disable half ratings
              onRated: (value) {
                setState(() {
                  rating = value; // Update the rating state
                });
                print("Rating value: $value"); // Print the rating value
              },
              starCount: 5, // Total number of stars
              rating: rating, // Current rating
              size: 40.0, // Size of each star
              isReadOnly: false, // Allow user interaction
              color: Colors.yellow, // Color of filled stars
              borderColor: Colors.yellow, // Color of unfilled stars
              spacing: 0.0, // Space between stars
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Add space between elements
            Text(
              "Your rating: $rating", // Display the current rating
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home page (RatingPage).
// 3. RatingPage is a StatefulWidget that maintains the current rating state.
// 4. The build method of _RatingPageState creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a SmoothStarRating widget is displayed, allowing users to rate.
// 6. When a user taps on a star, the onRated callback updates the rating state and prints the value.
// 7. The current rating is displayed below the star rating widget, updating in real-time as the user interacts.
```
