            ),
            // Add a shadow to an icon
            ShadowedImage(
              image: Icon(Icons.star),
              shadowColor: Colors.black,
              shadowOpacity: 0.5,
              shadowBlurRadius: 10,
            ),
            // Change the shadow style
            ShadowedImage(
              image: AssetImage('assets/image.png'),
              shadowColor: Colors.black,
              shadowOpacity: 0.5,
              shadowBlurRadius: 10,
              shadowStyle: ShadowStyle.inner,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a screen containing three images.
// 2. The first image has a drop shadow added to it using the `ShadowedImage` widget.
// 3. The second image is an icon that also has a drop shadow added to it.
// 4. The third image has an inner shadow added to it using the `shadowStyle` property.
// 5. The user can view the different shadow styles and effects by looking at the three images.

// Summary: This code demonstrates the use of the `shadowed_image` package to add shadows to images and icons in a Flutter app. It shows how to use the `ShadowedImage` widget to add a drop shadow, and how to change the shadow style using the `shadowStyle` property.
