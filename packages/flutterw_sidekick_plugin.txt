# flutterw_sidekick_plugin: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with `flutterw_sidekick_plugin`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutterw_sidekick_plugin: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutterw_sidekick_plugin).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions and configurations set up. For example, if the plugin requires camera access, add the following permission:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // or higher
    }
}
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add any required permissions, such as:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the camera for scanning QR codes.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
Once the package is installed and configured, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initialize and use the `RealFlutter` class from the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutterw_sidekick_plugin/flutterw_sidekick_plugin.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Sidekick Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we import the necessary packages and create a basic Flutter application that uses the `RealFlutter` class as the home widget.

# Complete Example of flutterw_sidekick_plugin

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutterw_sidekick_plugin/flutterw_sidekick_plugin.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Sidekick Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // State variable to hold data
  String _data = "Initial Data";

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the sidekick plugin
    SidekickPlugin.initialize();
  }

  // Function to update data
  void _updateData() {
    setState(() {
      _data = "Updated Data from Sidekick!";
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Sidekick Plugin Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              _data, // Display the current data
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _updateData, // Update data on button press
              child: Text('Update Data'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that manages its own state.
// 4. In the initState method, we initialize the SidekickPlugin.
// 5. The _data variable holds the current state, initially set to "Initial Data".
// 6. The build method creates a simple UI with a Text widget and a button.
// 7. When the button is pressed, the _updateData function is called, updating the state to "Updated Data from Sidekick!".
// 8. The UI rebuilds to reflect the updated state.
```
