Here's a detailed technical blog on the `commitlint_cli` Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# commitlint_cli Flutter Package

The `commitlint_cli` package is a powerful tool designed to enforce commit message conventions in Flutter projects. It helps maintain a clean and consistent commit history, which is crucial for collaboration in software development. By using this package, developers can ensure that their commit messages follow a predefined format, making it easier to understand the project's history and changes.

## When to Use

You should consider using the `commitlint_cli` package in the following scenarios:

- **Team Collaboration**: When working in a team, consistent commit messages help everyone understand the changes made over time.
- **Automated Release Management**: If you are using tools like semantic-release, having standardized commit messages is essential for generating changelogs and versioning.
- **Code Review Process**: Enforcing commit message conventions can streamline the code review process by providing context for each change.

## Features

- **Customizable Rules**: You can define your own commit message rules to fit your project's needs.
- **Integration with CI/CD**: Easily integrate with continuous integration and deployment pipelines to enforce commit message standards.
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automatically check commit messages before they are finalized, preventing non-compliant messages from being committed.

# Tutorial: Setting Up commitlint_cli in Your Flutter Project

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `commitlint_cli` package in a Flutter project. We will cover platform-specific details for both Android and iOS.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

First, add the `commitlint_cli` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  commitlint_cli: ^1.0.0
```

Run the following command to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Create Configuration File

Next, create a configuration file for `commitlint`. This file will define the rules for your commit messages. Create a file named `commitlint.config.js` in the root of your project:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  rules: {
    'header-max-length': [2, 'always', 72],
    'type-enum': [
      2,
      'always',
      [
        'feat',
        'fix',
        'docs',
        'style',
        'refactor',
        'perf',
        'test',
        'chore',
      ],
    ],
  },
};
```

## Step 3: Set Up Pre-commit Hook

To ensure that commit messages are checked before they are committed, you can set up a pre-commit hook. If you are using Git, you can create a file named `pre-commit` in the `.git/hooks` directory:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
npx commitlint --edit "$1"
```

Make sure to give execute permissions to the hook:

```bash
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

## Step 4: Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `build.gradle` file is configured to include the necessary dependencies for running scripts. You may need to add the following to your `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    dependencies {
        ...
        implementation 'com.github.commitlint:commitlint:1.0.0'
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your `Podfile` is set up correctly. You may need to add the following to your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
target 'Runner' do
  ...
  pod 'commitlint', '~> 1.0.0'
end
```

After making changes to the Podfile, run:

```bash
cd ios
pod install
```

## Step 5: Testing the Setup

To test your setup, try making a commit with a message that does not comply with the rules defined in your `commitlint.config.js`. You should see an error message indicating the issue with your commit message.

# Complete Example of Using commitlint_cli in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Commitlint CLI Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Commitlint CLI Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text(
                'Welcome to the Commitlint CLI Example!',
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // This button simulates a commit action
                  // In a real application, you would trigger a commit here
                  print('Simulating a commit...');
                },
                child: Text('Simulate Commit'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the Flutter application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the main UI.
// 3. The MaterialApp widget sets up the application with a title and theme.
// 4. The Scaffold widget provides a structure for the app, including an AppBar and body.
// 5. The body contains a Center widget that centers its child widgets.
// 6. A Column widget is used to arrange the Text and ElevatedButton vertically.
// 7. The ElevatedButton simulates a commit action when pressed, printing a message to the console.
// 8. This example demonstrates how to integrate commitlint_cli into a Flutter application by simulating a commit action.
