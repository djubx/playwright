# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `view_tabbar`

## Installation
To get started with the `view_tabbar` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  view_tabbar: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package. After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package
To use the `view_tabbar` package, you can create a simple Flutter application that utilizes the tab bar. Below is a basic example of how to implement it.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:
   ```dart
   import 'package:view_tabbar/view_tabbar.dart';
   ```

2. Create a `RealFlutter` class that extends `StatelessWidget` or `StatefulWidget` depending on your needs.

3. Implement the `ViewTabBar` widget in your build method, providing the necessary tabs and their corresponding views.

This setup will allow you to create a functional tabbed interface in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of `view_tabbar`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:view_tabbar/view_tabbar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'View TabBar Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ViewTabBar(
      // Define the tabs
      tabs: [
        Tab(text: 'Home'),
        Tab(text: 'Search'),
        Tab(text: 'Profile'),
      ],
      // Define the views for each tab
      views: [
        HomeView(),
        SearchView(),
        ProfileView(),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Home view widget
class HomeView extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(
      child: Text('Welcome to Home!'),
    );
  }
}

// Search view widget
class SearchView extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(
      child: Text('Search for something!'),
    );
  }
}

// Profile view widget
class ProfileView extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(
      child: Text('This is your profile!'),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. HomeScreen uses the ViewTabBar widget to create a tabbed interface.
// 4. The tabs are defined as 'Home', 'Search', and 'Profile'.
// 5. Each tab corresponds to a specific view: HomeView, SearchView, and ProfileView.
// 6. Each view displays a simple centered text message.
// 7. The user can switch between tabs, and the corresponding view will be displayed smoothly.
