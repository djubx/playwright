# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the "pos" Package

## Installation
To get started with the "pos" package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  pos: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package. After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file. You may need to add permissions for internet access and any other features your app requires.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` file to allow network requests. Add the following lines to your `Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
Once the package is installed and configured, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to initialize the POS system and process a transaction.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pos/pos.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'POS Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Initialize POS system
  final Pos pos = Pos();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Set up the POS system
    pos.initialize();
  }

  void processTransaction() {
    // Example transaction
    pos.processPayment(100.0, 'Credit Card').then((result) {
      // Handle payment result
      if (result.success) {
        print('Payment successful: ${result.transactionId}');
      } else {
        print('Payment failed: ${result.errorMessage}');
      }
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('POS System'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: processTransaction,
          child: Text('Process Payment'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Using the "pos" Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pos/pos.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'POS Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Initialize the POS system
  final Pos pos = Pos();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Set up the POS system
    pos.initialize();
  }

  void processTransaction() {
    // Example transaction processing
    pos.processPayment(100.0, 'Credit Card').then((result) {
      // Handle the payment result
      if (result.success) {
        // If payment is successful, print the transaction ID
        print('Payment successful: ${result.transactionId}');
      } else {
        // If payment fails, print the error message
        print('Payment failed: ${result.errorMessage}');
      }
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('POS System'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: processTransaction, // Trigger payment processing
          child: Text('Process Payment'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that initializes the POS system in its state.
// 4. In the initState method, the POS system is set up by calling pos.initialize().
// 5. The processTransaction method is defined to handle payment processing.
// 6. When the button is pressed, processTransaction is called, which attempts to process a payment of 100.0 using a credit card.
// 7. The result of the payment is handled with a callback, printing either the transaction ID or an error message based on the success of the payment.
