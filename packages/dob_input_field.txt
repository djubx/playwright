In summary, the code flows as follows:

1. The user opens the app and is presented with a date of birth input field.
2. The user selects a date from the calendar or enters it manually.
3. The selected date is displayed below the input field.
4. When the user selects a new date, the displayed date is updated.

This code demonstrates how to use the `dob_input_field` package to create a customizable date of birth input field in a Flutter app.
