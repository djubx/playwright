# from_css_color Flutter Package

The `from_css_color` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that allows for easy conversion of CSS color strings into Flutter's `Color` objects. This package is particularly useful for developers who are transitioning from web development to Flutter or those who want to maintain consistency in color usage across different platforms.

## When to Use

You might want to use the `from_css_color` package in scenarios such as:
- **Web to Mobile Transition**: If you have a web application with CSS-defined colors and you want to replicate the same color scheme in your Flutter app.
- **Dynamic Color Management**: When you need to manage colors dynamically based on user input or external data sources that provide colors in CSS format.
- **Theming**: When creating themes that require colors defined in CSS format, allowing for easier integration with web-based design systems.

## Features
- **CSS Color Parsing**: Supports a wide range of CSS color formats, including named colors, hex codes, RGB, RGBA, HSL, and HSLA.
- **Ease of Use**: Simple API that allows for quick conversion of color strings to Flutter's `Color` objects.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

By leveraging this package, developers can ensure that their Flutter applications have a consistent and visually appealing color scheme that aligns with their design specifications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using from_css_color

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `from_css_color` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  from_css_color: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:from_css_color/from_css_color.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

You can now use the `from_css_color` package to convert CSS color strings into Flutter `Color` objects. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
Color myColor = fromCssColor('rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5)'); // Semi-transparent red
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

#### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Optimizations

While the `from_css_color` package is efficient, consider caching frequently used colors to improve performance, especially if you are converting colors dynamically in your application.

With these steps, you are now ready to use the `from_css_color` package in your Flutter applications!

# Complete Example of from_css_color in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:from_css_color/from_css_color.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'from_css_color Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('from_css_color Example'),
          backgroundColor: fromCssColor('blue'), // Using CSS color
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Container(
                width: 100,
                height: 100,
                color: fromCssColor('rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5)'), // Semi-transparent red
                child: Center(child: Text('Red')),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              Container(
                width: 100,
                height: 100,
                color: fromCssColor('#00FF00'), // Green in hex
                child: Center(child: Text('Green')),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              Container(
                width: 100,
                height: 100,
                color: fromCssColor('hsl(240, 100%, 50%)'), // Blue in HSL
                child: Center(child: Text('Blue')),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. The AppBar's background color is set using from_css_color to convert 'blue' from CSS format.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains a Column with three Containers, each demonstrating different CSS color formats:
//    - The first Container uses 'rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5)' for a semi-transparent red background.
//    - The second Container uses '#00FF00' for a solid green background.
//    - The third Container uses 'hsl(240, 100%, 50%)' for a blue background.
// 6. Each Container has a Text widget centered inside it, displaying the color name.
```
