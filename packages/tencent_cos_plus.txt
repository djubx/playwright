# Setting Up and Using tencent_cos_plus

## Installation
To get started with the `tencent_cos_plus` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  tencent_cos_plus: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/tencent_cos_plus).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. **Permissions**: Add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
1. **Permissions**: Add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file to request permission for accessing the photo library:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to upload images.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need permission to save images to your photo library.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the package, you need to initialize it with your Tencent Cloud credentials. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to upload a file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tencent_cos_plus/tencent_cos_plus.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Tencent COS Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initialize Tencent COS
              final cos = TencentCos(
                secretId: 'your_secret_id',
                secretKey: 'your_secret_key',
                region: 'your_region',
              );

              // Upload a file
              final result = await cos.uploadFile(
                bucket: 'your_bucket_name',
                filePath: 'path_to_your_file',
                key: 'your_file_key',
              );

              // Check the result
              if (result.isSuccess) {
                print('File uploaded successfully: ${result.url}');
              } else {
                print('Upload failed: ${result.error}');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Upload File'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Using tencent_cos_plus

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tencent_cos_plus/tencent_cos_plus.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Tencent COS Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initialize Tencent COS with your credentials
              final cos = TencentCos(
                secretId: 'your_secret_id', // Your Tencent Cloud Secret ID
                secretKey: 'your_secret_key', // Your Tencent Cloud Secret Key
                region: 'your_region', // The region of your COS bucket
              );

              // Upload a file to the specified bucket
              final result = await cos.uploadFile(
                bucket: 'your_bucket_name', // The name of your COS bucket
                filePath: 'path_to_your_file', // Local path to the file you want to upload
                key: 'your_file_key', // The key under which the file will be stored in COS
              );

              // Check if the upload was successful
              if (result.isSuccess) {
                // Print the URL of the uploaded file
                print('File uploaded successfully: ${result.url}');
              } else {
                // Print the error message if the upload failed
                print('Upload failed: ${result.error}');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Upload File'), // Button to trigger file upload
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with a MaterialApp widget that contains a Scaffold.
// 2. An AppBar is created with the title 'Tencent COS Example'.
// 3. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 4. An ElevatedButton is displayed, which, when pressed, initializes the Tencent COS instance.
// 5. The uploadFile method is called to upload a file to the specified bucket.
// 6. The result of the upload is checked, and either the success URL or an error message is printed to the console.
