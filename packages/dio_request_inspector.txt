# Tutorial: Setting Up dio_request_inspector

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `dio_request_inspector` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependencies

First, you need to add the `dio` and `dio_request_inspector` packages to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dio: ^5.0.0
  dio_request_inspector: ^1.0.0
```

## Step 2: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the necessary packages:

```dart
import 'package:dio/dio.dart';
import 'package:dio_request_inspector/dio_request_inspector.dart';
```

## Step 3: Configure Dio with Request Inspector

You need to configure the Dio instance to use the `RequestInspectorInterceptor`. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

```dart
void main() {
  // Create a Dio instance
  final dio = Dio();

  // Add the Request Inspector interceptor
  dio.interceptors.add(RequestInspectorInterceptor());

  // Now you can use dio for making requests
}
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

#### iOS

For iOS, you may need to configure App Transport Security settings in your `Info.plist` if you are making requests to non-HTTPS endpoints:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Making Requests

You can now make HTTP requests using the configured Dio instance. The request inspector will automatically log the requests and responses.

```dart
void fetchData() async {
  try {
    final response = await dio.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
    print(response.data);
  } catch (e) {
    print('Error: $e');
  }
}
```

With these steps, you have successfully set up the `dio_request_inspector` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of dio_request_inspector

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dio/dio.dart';
import 'package:dio_request_inspector/dio_request_inspector.dart';

void main() {
  // Create a Dio instance
  final dio = Dio();

  // Add the Request Inspector interceptor
  dio.interceptors.add(RequestInspectorInterceptor());

  runApp(MyApp(dio: dio));
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  final Dio dio;

  MyApp({required this.dio});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dio Request Inspector Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Dio Request Inspector'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              fetchData();
            },
            child: Text('Fetch Data'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to fetch data from an API
  void fetchData() async {
    try {
      // Make a GET request
      final response = await dio.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
      // Print the response data
      print(response.data);
    } catch (e) {
      // Print any errors
      print('Error: $e');
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes a Dio instance and adds the Request Inspector interceptor.
// 2. The MyApp widget is created, which builds a simple UI with a button.
// 3. When the button is pressed, the fetchData function is called.
// 4. The fetchData function makes a GET request to the JSONPlaceholder API.
// 5. The response data is printed to the console, and any errors are caught and printed.
