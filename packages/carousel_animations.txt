          animationCurve: Curves.easeInOut,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a carousel of three pages.
// 2. The user can swipe left or right to navigate between the pages.
// 3. As the user navigates between the pages, the carousel animates the transition between the pages.
// 4. The animation duration and curve can be customized to suit the user's preferences.
// 5. The carousel can be used to display any type of content, such as images, text, or widgets.
```

// In summary, the code flows as follows:
// The user is presented with a carousel of three pages.
// The user can swipe left or right to navigate between the pages.
// As the user navigates between the pages, the carousel animates the transition between the pages.
