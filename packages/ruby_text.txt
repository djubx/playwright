Here's a detailed technical blog on the "ruby_text" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Ruby Text Flutter Package

The **ruby_text** Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to facilitate the display of ruby text in Flutter applications. Ruby text is a form of annotation used primarily in East Asian typography, where small characters (usually phonetic guides) are placed above or beside the main text. This package is particularly useful for applications that require language learning, such as Japanese or Chinese, where ruby text can help users understand pronunciation and meaning.

## When to Use This Package
- **Language Learning Apps**: Ideal for apps focused on teaching languages that utilize ruby text.
- **Educational Tools**: Useful in educational applications that require phonetic annotations.
- **Cultural Applications**: Applications that aim to present East Asian literature or texts with proper formatting.

## Features
- **Customizable Ruby Text**: Allows developers to customize the appearance of ruby text, including font size, color, and positioning.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes and orientations, ensuring that ruby text is displayed correctly across devices.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate into existing Flutter applications with minimal setup.

The **ruby_text** package enhances the user experience by providing clear and accessible text annotations, making it an essential tool for developers working with East Asian languages.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Ruby Text Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started with the **ruby_text** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ruby_text: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file, depending on your app's requirements. However, the **ruby_text** package does not require any specific configurations for basic usage.

## Step 4: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement ruby text in your app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ruby_text/ruby_text.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Ruby Text Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: RubyText(
            text: '漢字',
            ruby: 'かんじ',
            textStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.black),
            rubyStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 12, color: Colors.grey),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays the kanji for "kanji" with its ruby text annotation.

# Complete Example of Ruby Text in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ruby_text/ruby_text.dart';

// Main class of the Flutter application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Ruby Text Example'), // Title of the app
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: RubyText(
            text: '漢字', // Main text (kanji)
            ruby: 'かんじ', // Ruby text (pronunciation)
            textStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.black), // Style for main text
            rubyStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 12, color: Colors.grey), // Style for ruby text
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp, which provides the basic structure of the app.
3. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold widget is created, which includes an AppBar and a body.
4. The AppBar displays the title "Ruby Text Example".
5. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget, which centers its child widget.
6. The child widget is a RubyText widget that displays the kanji "漢字" with its ruby text "かんじ" above it.
7. The textStyle and rubyStyle properties are used to customize the appearance of the main text and ruby text, respectively.
8. The application is responsive and will display correctly on different devices.
