# Regexed Text Flutter Package

The `regexed_text` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed for developers who need to manipulate and display text based on regular expressions. This package allows you to highlight, format, and transform text dynamically, making it ideal for applications that require text parsing, such as chat applications, code editors, or any app that deals with user-generated content.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the `regexed_text` package in scenarios such as:
- **Highlighting Syntax**: In code editors or markdown viewers, where specific patterns need to be highlighted.
- **Text Formatting**: For chat applications where certain keywords or phrases should stand out.
- **Dynamic Content**: When displaying user-generated content that may contain various patterns needing special formatting.

## Features

- **Pattern Matching**: Easily match and manipulate text using regular expressions.
- **Customizable Styles**: Apply different styles (colors, fonts) to matched patterns.
- **Performance**: Efficiently processes large amounts of text without significant performance overhead.

With these features, the `regexed_text` package provides a flexible and efficient way to handle text in Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Regexed Text Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `regexed_text` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  regexed_text: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to use the `regexed_text` package to highlight specific words in a text.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:regexed_text/regexed_text.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Regexed Text Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: RegexedText(
            text: 'This is a sample text with keywords like Flutter and Dart.',
            patterns: [
              RegexedPattern(
                pattern: r'Flutter',
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.blue, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
              ),
              RegexedPattern(
                pattern: r'Dart',
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.green, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that highlights the words "Flutter" and "Dart" in different colors.

# Complete Example of Regexed Text Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:regexed_text/regexed_text.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Regexed Text Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: RegexedText(
            // The text to be displayed and processed
            text: 'This is a sample text with keywords like Flutter and Dart.',
            patterns: [
              // Define a pattern for the word "Flutter"
              RegexedPattern(
                pattern: r'Flutter',
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.blue, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
              ),
              // Define a pattern for the word "Dart"
              RegexedPattern(
                pattern: r'Dart',
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.green, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Regexed Text Example".
// 4. In the body of the Scaffold, we center the RegexedText widget.
// 5. The RegexedText widget takes a string of text and a list of RegexedPattern objects.
// 6. Each RegexedPattern defines a regex pattern and the style to apply when that pattern is matched.
// 7. The text is displayed with "Flutter" highlighted in blue and "Dart" highlighted in green, demonstrating the package's functionality.
```
