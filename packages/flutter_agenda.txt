# Setting Up and Using `flutter_agenda`

## Installation

To get started with `flutter_agenda`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_agenda: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_agenda).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions to allow access to the calendar:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_CALENDAR"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_CALENDAR"/>
```

### iOS

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request permission to access the calendar:

```xml
<key>NSCalendarsUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your calendar.</string>
```

## Basic Usage

To use the `flutter_agenda` package, you can create a simple calendar widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_agenda/flutter_agenda.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Agenda Example')),
        body: AgendaWidget(), // This is where the calendar will be displayed
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application with an agenda widget. You can further customize the `AgendaWidget` to display events and handle user interactions.

# Complete Example of `flutter_agenda`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_agenda/flutter_agenda.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // List to hold events
  List<Event> events = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Load initial events
    loadEvents();
  }

  // Function to load events
  void loadEvents() {
    // Here you would typically fetch events from a database or API
    events = [
      Event(
        title: 'Meeting with Team',
        description: 'Discuss project updates',
        startTime: DateTime.now().add(Duration(hours: 1)),
        endTime: DateTime.now().add(Duration(hours: 2)),
      ),
      Event(
        title: 'Doctor Appointment',
        description: 'Annual check-up',
        startTime: DateTime.now().add(Duration(days: 1, hours: 3)),
        endTime: DateTime.now().add(Duration(days: 1, hours: 4)),
      ),
    ];
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Agenda Example')),
        body: AgendaWidget(
          events: events, // Pass the list of events to the widget
          onEventTap: (event) {
            // Handle event tap
            showDialog(
              context: context,
              builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                title: Text(event.title),
                content: Text(event.description),
                actions: [
                  TextButton(
                    onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                    child: Text('Close'),
                  ),
                ],
              ),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Explanation of the application flow:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 2. In the initState method, we call loadEvents to initialize our events list.
// 3. The loadEvents function populates the events list with sample data.
// 4. The build method returns a MaterialApp with an AppBar and an AgendaWidget.
// 5. The AgendaWidget displays the events and allows users to tap on them.
// 6. When an event is tapped, a dialog shows the event's title and description.
```

// The application flow is straightforward:
// - The app initializes and loads events in the `initState` method.
// - The `AgendaWidget` displays the events and handles user interactions.
// - Tapping an event opens a dialog with details about the event, enhancing user experience.
