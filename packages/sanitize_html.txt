Here's a detailed technical blog on the "sanitize_html" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Sanitize HTML Flutter Package

The `sanitize_html` package for Flutter is a powerful tool designed to help developers safely render HTML content in their applications. It sanitizes HTML input to prevent XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks, ensuring that only safe and valid HTML is displayed. This package is particularly useful when dealing with user-generated content, such as comments, posts, or any other form of input that may contain HTML.

## When to Use This Package

- **User-Generated Content**: When displaying content that users can input, such as comments or blog posts, it's crucial to sanitize the HTML to prevent malicious scripts from executing.
- **Rich Text Editors**: If your application includes a rich text editor that allows users to format their text with HTML, using this package ensures that the output is safe.
- **Displaying External HTML**: When fetching HTML content from external sources, sanitizing it before rendering is essential to maintain security.

## Features

- **XSS Protection**: Automatically removes potentially harmful scripts and tags from HTML content.
- **Customizable**: Allows developers to specify which HTML tags and attributes should be allowed.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to set up and use within any Flutter application.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Sanitize HTML Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `sanitize_html` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  sanitize_html: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you are fetching HTML content from the web. Add the following lines to allow arbitrary loads:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that the package is set up, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to sanitize and display HTML content.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sanitize_html/sanitize_html.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample HTML content
    String unsafeHtml = '<div><h1>Hello World!</h1><script>alert("XSS Attack!");</script></div>';
    
    // Sanitize the HTML content
    String safeHtml = sanitizeHtml(unsafeHtml);

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Sanitize HTML Example')),
        body: SingleChildScrollView(
          child: Html(data: safeHtml), // Display sanitized HTML
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

# Complete Example of Using the Sanitize HTML Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sanitize_html/sanitize_html.dart';
import 'package:flutter_html/flutter_html.dart'; // Import flutter_html to render HTML

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample HTML content with a potential XSS attack
    String unsafeHtml = '<div><h1>Hello World!</h1><script>alert("XSS Attack!");</script></div>';
    
    // Sanitize the HTML content to remove any harmful scripts
    String safeHtml = sanitizeHtml(unsafeHtml);

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Sanitize HTML Example')),
        body: SingleChildScrollView(
          child: Html(data: safeHtml), // Render the sanitized HTML
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. Inside the RealFlutter widget, we define a string containing unsafe HTML, which includes a script tag.
// 3. We then call the sanitizeHtml function to clean the HTML, removing any potentially harmful content.
// 4. The sanitized HTML is passed to the Html widget from the flutter_html package, which renders it safely.
// 5. The app displays a simple interface with an AppBar and the sanitized content in the body.
```

In summary, the `sanitize_html` package is an essential tool for any Flutter developer dealing with HTML content. By following the steps outlined in this blog, you can ensure that your application remains secure while providing rich content to your users. The complete example demonstrates how to integrate the package effectively, ensuring that any unsafe HTML is sanitized before rendering.
