# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `langchain_chroma`

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `langchain_chroma` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `langchain_chroma` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  langchain_chroma: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/langchain_chroma).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:langchain_chroma/langchain_chroma.dart';
```

## Step 4: Basic Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the `langchain_chroma` package in your Flutter application:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'LangChain Chroma Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late ChromaClient _client;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the Chroma client
    _client = ChromaClient();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('LangChain Chroma Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to LangChain Chroma!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize the `ChromaClient` in the `initState` method of our `RealFlutter` widget. This client will be used to interact with the Chroma library.

# Complete Example of `langchain_chroma`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:langchain_chroma/langchain_chroma.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'LangChain Chroma Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late ChromaClient _client; // Declare the Chroma client
  String _response = ''; // Variable to hold the response from Chroma

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the Chroma client
    _client = ChromaClient();
  }

  // Function to process input text and get a response
  void _processInput(String input) async {
    // Call the Chroma API to get a response based on the input
    var result = await _client.query(input);
    setState(() {
      _response = result; // Update the response variable
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('LangChain Chroma Example'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            TextField(
              onSubmitted: _processInput, // Process input on submission
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Enter your query',
                border: OutlineInputBorder(),
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text('Response: $_response'), // Display the response
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. In RealFlutter, we initialize the ChromaClient in the initState method.
// 4. The user can enter a query in the TextField, which triggers the _processInput function on submission.
// 5. The _processInput function sends the input to the Chroma API and updates the response state.
// 6. The response is displayed below the TextField, allowing the user to see the result of their query.
```
