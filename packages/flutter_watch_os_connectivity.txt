# Tutorial: Setting Up flutter_watch_os_connectivity

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_watch_os_connectivity` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_watch_os_connectivity` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_watch_os_connectivity: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires Bluetooth access to connect to your Apple Watch.</string>
<key>NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires Bluetooth access to connect to your Apple Watch.</string>
```

2. Ensure that your deployment target is set to at least iOS 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN" />
```

2. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your Flutter application.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_watch_os_connectivity/flutter_watch_os_connectivity.dart';
```

2. Initialize the connectivity manager in your main application class:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  final WatchOSConnectivity _connectivity = WatchOSConnectivity();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _connectivity.initialize();
  }

  // Add methods to send and receive messages here
}
```

3. Implement methods to send and receive messages:

```dart
void sendMessage(String message) {
  _connectivity.sendMessage(message);
}

void receiveMessage() {
  _connectivity.onMessageReceived.listen((message) {
    // Handle the received message
    print("Received message: $message");
  });
}
```

With these steps, you are now ready to use the `flutter_watch_os_connectivity` package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of flutter_watch_os_connectivity

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_watch_os_connectivity/flutter_watch_os_connectivity.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  final WatchOSConnectivity _connectivity = WatchOSConnectivity();
  String _receivedMessage = "No messages yet";

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _connectivity.initialize(); // Initialize the connectivity manager
    receiveMessage(); // Start listening for incoming messages
  }

  // Method to send a message to the watch
  void sendMessage(String message) {
    _connectivity.sendMessage(message); // Send the message
  }

  // Method to listen for incoming messages
  void receiveMessage() {
    _connectivity.onMessageReceived.listen((message) {
      setState(() {
        _receivedMessage = message; // Update the state with the received message
      });
      print("Received message: $message"); // Log the received message
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('WatchOS Connectivity Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text('Received Message:'),
              Text(
                _receivedMessage,
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  sendMessage("Hello from Flutter!"); // Send a test message
                },
                child: Text('Send Message to Watch'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app initializes the WatchOSConnectivity instance in initState.
// 2. It sets up a listener for incoming messages using receiveMessage().
// 3. When the user presses the "Send Message to Watch" button, it calls sendMessage() to send a message to the watch.
// 4. If a message is received, it updates the _receivedMessage state variable and displays it on the screen.
