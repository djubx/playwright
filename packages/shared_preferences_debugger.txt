# Overview of the `shared_preferences_debugger` Flutter Package

The `shared_preferences_debugger` package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who want to debug and manage their application's shared preferences more effectively. Shared preferences are commonly used for storing simple data such as user settings, preferences, and other lightweight data. However, debugging these preferences can sometimes be challenging, especially when dealing with complex applications.

## When to Use This Package
You should consider using `shared_preferences_debugger` when:
- You need to inspect and modify shared preferences during development.
- You want to ensure that your app's settings are being saved and retrieved correctly.
- You are debugging issues related to data persistence in your Flutter application.

## Key Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides a simple UI to view and edit shared preferences.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Changes made in the debugger are reflected in real-time within your application.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to set up and use within existing Flutter projects.

By leveraging this package, developers can streamline their debugging process and enhance their productivity when working with shared preferences.

# Setting Up and Using `shared_preferences_debugger`

## Installation
To get started with the `shared_preferences_debugger`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  shared_preferences_debugger: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences_debugger).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions. You typically do not need to add any special permissions for shared preferences, but make sure your app is set up correctly to use the package.

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to ensure that your app's deployment target is set to at least iOS 9.0. This can be done in the `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
```

## Usage
Once you have installed the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s how to initialize and use the `shared_preferences_debugger`:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:
   ```dart
   import 'package:shared_preferences_debugger/shared_preferences_debugger.dart';
   ```

2. Initialize the debugger in your `main` function:
   ```dart
   void main() {
     SharedPreferencesDebugger.init();
     runApp(MyApp());
   }
   ```

3. Use the debugger to view and modify shared preferences during development.

With these steps, you are ready to start debugging your shared preferences effectively!

# Complete Example of Using `shared_preferences_debugger`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';
import 'package:shared_preferences_debugger/shared_preferences_debugger.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the shared preferences debugger
  SharedPreferencesDebugger.init();
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Shared Preferences Debugger Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  String _storedValue = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _loadStoredValue();
  }

  // Load the stored value from shared preferences
  void _loadStoredValue() async {
    SharedPreferences prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
    setState(() {
      _storedValue = prefs.getString('my_key') ?? 'No value stored';
    });
  }

  // Save a new value to shared preferences
  void _saveValue(String value) async {
    SharedPreferences prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
    await prefs.setString('my_key', value);
    _loadStoredValue(); // Reload the value after saving
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Shared Preferences Debugger Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Stored Value: $_storedValue'),
            TextField(
              onSubmitted: _saveValue, // Save value on submission
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Enter a new value',
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts by initializing the SharedPreferencesDebugger.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is displayed, which loads the stored value from shared preferences.
// 4. The user can enter a new value in the text field and submit it.
// 5. Upon submission, the new value is saved to shared preferences, and the displayed value is updated.
