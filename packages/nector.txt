# Nector Flutter Package: A Comprehensive Overview

The **Nector** package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who want to implement advanced state management and data handling in their applications. It simplifies the process of managing complex states and provides a clean API for interacting with data sources, making it an excellent choice for both small and large-scale applications.

## When to Use Nector
- **State Management**: When your application requires a robust solution for managing state across multiple widgets.
- **Data Handling**: If you need to fetch, cache, and manipulate data from various sources (like APIs or local databases).
- **Reactive Programming**: When you want to leverage reactive programming paradigms to build responsive UIs.

## Key Features
- **Reactive State Management**: Automatically updates the UI when the underlying data changes.
- **Data Caching**: Efficiently caches data to minimize network calls and improve performance.
- **Easy Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with existing Flutter applications without requiring extensive changes.
- **Support for Multiple Data Sources**: Works with REST APIs, local databases, and more.

With these features, Nector stands out as a versatile package for developers looking to enhance their Flutter applications.

# Nector Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the Nector package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and include the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  nector: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/nector).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` to allow network requests if you are fetching data from the internet. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
Once you have installed the package and configured your project, you can start using Nector in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set up a basic state management scenario using Nector.

1. **Create a Nector Model**: Define a model class that represents the data you want to manage.
2. **Initialize Nector**: Set up Nector in your main application file.
3. **Use Nector in Widgets**: Access and manipulate the state in your Flutter widgets.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:nector/nector.dart';

// Define a simple model class for demonstration
class User {
  String name;
  int age;

  User({required this.name, required this.age});
}

// Main application class
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Initialize Nector with a User model
    final userState = Nector<User>(User(name: 'John Doe', age: 30));

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Nector Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: NectorBuilder<User>(
            state: userState,
            builder: (context, user) {
              // Display user information
              return Column(
                mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
                children: [
                  Text('Name: ${user.name}'),
                  Text('Age: ${user.age}'),
                  ElevatedButton(
                    onPressed: () {
                      // Update user data
                      userState.update(User(name: 'Jane Doe', age: 25));
                    },
                    child: Text('Change User'),
                  ),
                ],
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The RealFlutter widget initializes a Nector state with a User model.
// 2. The NectorBuilder listens to changes in the userState.
// 3. When the button is pressed, the userState is updated with new data.
// 4. The UI automatically rebuilds to reflect the updated user information.
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```
<!-- END_MAIN -->

## Summary of Application Flow
The application starts by initializing a `Nector` state with a `User` model. The `NectorBuilder` widget listens for changes in the state and rebuilds the UI whenever the state is updated. When the "Change User" button is pressed, the user data is updated, and the UI reflects these changes automatically, demonstrating the reactive capabilities of the Nector package.
