Here's a detailed technical blog on the "airplane_mode_checker" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Airplane Mode Checker Flutter Package

The `airplane_mode_checker` Flutter package is a powerful tool that allows developers to easily check the airplane mode status of a device. This package is particularly useful in applications where network connectivity is crucial, such as messaging apps, online games, or any app that relies on internet access. By detecting whether the device is in airplane mode, developers can provide users with appropriate feedback or alter the app's behavior accordingly.

## When to Use This Package
- **Network-Dependent Applications**: If your app requires a stable internet connection, checking for airplane mode can help prevent errors and improve user experience.
- **User Notifications**: Notify users when they attempt to perform actions that require internet access while in airplane mode.
- **Conditional Features**: Enable or disable features based on the airplane mode status.

## Features
- **Simple API**: The package provides a straightforward API to check the airplane mode status.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices.
- **Real-time Updates**: Listen for changes in airplane mode status, allowing your app to respond dynamically.

With these features, the `airplane_mode_checker` package is an essential tool for Flutter developers looking to enhance their applications' connectivity management.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Airplane Mode Checker Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `airplane_mode_checker` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  airplane_mode_checker: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/airplane_mode_checker).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, you need to ensure that the app has the necessary permissions to access the airplane mode status. Open the `AndroidManifest.xml` file located in `android/app/src/main/` and add the following permission:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, no additional permissions are required. However, ensure that your app's deployment target is set to at least iOS 9.0 in the `ios/Podfile`.

## Step 3: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:airplane_mode_checker/airplane_mode_checker.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package
You can now use the package to check the airplane mode status. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
void checkAirplaneMode() async {
  bool isAirplaneModeOn = await AirplaneModeChecker.isAirplaneModeOn;
  if (isAirplaneModeOn) {
    print("Airplane mode is ON");
  } else {
    print("Airplane mode is OFF");
  }
}
```

This function checks the airplane mode status and prints the result to the console.

## Step 5: Listening for Changes
To listen for changes in airplane mode status, you can use a stream:

```dart
AirplaneModeChecker.airplaneModeStream.listen((isAirplaneModeOn) {
  if (isAirplaneModeOn) {
    print("Airplane mode has been turned ON");
  } else {
    print("Airplane mode has been turned OFF");
  }
});
```

This will allow your app to respond dynamically to changes in airplane mode status.

With these steps, you are now ready to integrate the `airplane_mode_checker` package into your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Using the Airplane Mode Checker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:airplane_mode_checker/airplane_mode_checker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  bool _isAirplaneModeOn = false;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Check the initial airplane mode status
    _checkAirplaneMode();

    // Listen for changes in airplane mode status
    AirplaneModeChecker.airplaneModeStream.listen((isAirplaneModeOn) {
      setState(() {
        _isAirplaneModeOn = isAirplaneModeOn; // Update the state
      });
    });
  }

  // Function to check the airplane mode status
  void _checkAirplaneMode() async {
    bool isAirplaneModeOn = await AirplaneModeChecker.isAirplaneModeOn;
    setState(() {
      _isAirplaneModeOn = isAirplaneModeOn; // Update the state
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Airplane Mode Checker'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(
            _isAirplaneModeOn ? 'Airplane Mode is ON' : 'Airplane Mode is OFF',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
          ),
        ),
        floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
          onPressed: _checkAirplaneMode, // Check status on button press
          tooltip: 'Check Airplane Mode',
          child: Icon(Icons.airplanemode_active),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget, we initialize the state and check the airplane mode status.
// 3. The _checkAirplaneMode function is called to get the current status and update the UI.
// 4. We also listen for changes in airplane mode status using a stream.
// 5. The UI displays whether airplane mode is ON or OFF based on the current state.
// 6. A floating action button allows users to manually check the airplane mode status again.
