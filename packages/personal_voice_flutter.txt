# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Personal Voice Flutter

## Installation
To add the `personal_voice_flutter` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  personal_voice_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/personal_voice_flutter).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request microphone access:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for voice recognition.</string>
<key>NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to speech recognition for voice commands.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `personal_voice_flutter` package, you need to initialize the voice recognition and text-to-speech features in your Flutter app. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to do this:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:personal_voice_flutter/personal_voice_flutter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _recognizedText = '';
  final PersonalVoiceFlutter _voice = PersonalVoiceFlutter();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _voice.initialize();
  }

  void _startListening() async {
    String result = await _voice.startListening();
    setState(() {
      _recognizedText = result;
    });
  }

  void _speak(String text) {
    _voice.speak(text);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Personal Voice Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Recognized Text: $_recognizedText'),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _startListening,
              child: Text('Start Listening'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () => _speak('Hello, how can I assist you?'),
              child: Text('Speak'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Personal Voice Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:personal_voice_flutter/personal_voice_flutter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _recognizedText = ''; // Variable to hold recognized text
  final PersonalVoiceFlutter _voice = PersonalVoiceFlutter(); // Instance of the voice package

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _voice.initialize(); // Initialize the voice recognition and TTS
  }

  // Method to start listening for voice input
  void _startListening() async {
    String result = await _voice.startListening(); // Start listening and get the result
    setState(() {
      _recognizedText = result; // Update the recognized text
    });
  }

  // Method to convert text to speech
  void _speak(String text) {
    _voice.speak(text); // Use the voice package to speak the text
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Personal Voice Example')), // App bar title
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Recognized Text: $_recognizedText'), // Display recognized text
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _startListening, // Start listening on button press
              child: Text('Start Listening'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () => _speak('Hello, how can I assist you?'), // Speak predefined text
              child: Text('Speak'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(home: RealFlutter())); // Run the app with RealFlutter as the home widget
}
```

// The application starts by initializing the `PersonalVoiceFlutter` instance in the `initState` method. 
// When the user presses the "Start Listening" button, the app listens for voice input and updates the displayed text with the recognized speech. 
// The "Speak" button triggers the text-to-speech functionality, allowing the app to read out a predefined message. 
// This simple interface demonstrates the core functionalities of the `personal_voice_flutter` package, showcasing both voice recognition and speech synthesis capabilities.
