# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Flat 3D Button Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **flat_3d_button** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flat_3d_button: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the button, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flat_3d_button/flat_3d_button.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Button

You can now use the **Flat3DButton** widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to implement it:

```dart
Flat3DButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // Action to perform on button press
  },
  color: Colors.blue,
  shadowColor: Colors.black,
  text: 'Click Me',
  width: 200,
  height: 60,
);
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid compatibility issues:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

#### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Customization

You can customize the button's appearance by modifying its properties. Here are some of the customizable properties:

- `color`: The background color of the button.
- `shadowColor`: The color of the button's shadow.
- `text`: The text displayed on the button.
- `width` and `height`: Dimensions of the button.

Experiment with these properties to achieve the desired look and feel for your application.

# Complete Example of Using Flat 3D Button

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flat_3d_button/flat_3d_button.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flat 3D Button Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flat 3D Button Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Flat3DButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Action to perform on button press
              print('Button Pressed!');
            },
            color: Colors.blue, // Set the button color
            shadowColor: Colors.black, // Set the shadow color
            text: 'Click Me', // Button text
            width: 200, // Button width
            height: 60, // Button height
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with MyApp as the root widget.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Flat 3D Button Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered, containing a Flat3DButton widget.
// 5. When the button is pressed, it triggers the onPressed callback, which currently prints 'Button Pressed!' to the console.
// 6. The button is styled with a blue background, black shadow, and specified dimensions.
