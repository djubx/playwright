- **Interactive Games**: Can be used in games where users need to make quick selections from a set of choices.

## Features

- **Customizable Appearance**: The wheel picker allows customization of colors, text styles, and item heights.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Provides a smooth scrolling experience, making it easy for users to navigate through options.
- **Callback Functions**: Supports callback functions to handle user selections, making it easy to integrate with other parts of your application.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Wheel Picker

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the **wheel_picker** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  wheel_picker: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:wheel_picker/wheel_picker.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Wheel Picker

You can now use the `WheelPicker` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
WheelPicker(
  data: ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3'],
  onChanged: (value) {
    print('Selected: $value');
  },
)
```

This code snippet creates a basic wheel picker with three options. The `onChanged` callback will print the selected value to the console.

# Complete Example of Wheel Picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:wheel_picker/wheel_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Wheel Picker Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Wheel Picker Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: WheelPickerExample(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class WheelPickerExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _WheelPickerExampleState createState() => _WheelPickerExampleState();
}

class _WheelPickerExampleState extends State<WheelPickerExample> {
  // Variable to hold the selected value
  String selectedValue = 'Option 1';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        // Display the currently selected value
        Text(
          'Selected: $selectedValue',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20),
        // Wheel Picker widget
        WheelPicker(
          data: ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3'],
          onChanged: (value) {
            // Update the selected value when the user picks an option
            setState(() {
              selectedValue = value;
            });
          },
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp and sets up the home screen.
// 3. The home screen contains an AppBar and a centered WheelPickerExample widget.
// 4. WheelPickerExample is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the selected value.
// 5. The build method of WheelPickerExample displays the currently selected value and the WheelPicker.
// 6. When the user selects an option from the WheelPicker, the onChanged callback updates the selectedValue state.
// 7. The UI is rebuilt to reflect the new selected value, providing immediate feedback to the user.
```
