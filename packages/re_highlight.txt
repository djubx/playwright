# re_highlight Flutter Package

The `re_highlight` package is a powerful tool for syntax highlighting in Flutter applications. It allows developers to display code snippets with syntax highlighting, making it easier for users to read and understand code. This package is particularly useful for applications that involve code sharing, educational platforms, or any app that requires displaying code in a visually appealing manner.

## When to Use `re_highlight`

- **Code Editors**: If you're building a code editor or a learning platform where users can view and edit code snippets.
- **Documentation Apps**: For applications that display programming documentation or tutorials.
- **Blogging Platforms**: If your app allows users to write and share code snippets in blog posts.

## Features

- **Customizable Syntax Highlighting**: Supports various programming languages and allows customization of colors and styles.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to set up and use within your Flutter application.
- **Performance Optimized**: Designed to handle large code snippets efficiently.

## Example Use Cases

1. **Educational Apps**: Displaying code examples in a programming course.
2. **Technical Blogs**: Highlighting code snippets in articles.
3. **Code Review Tools**: Showing code changes with syntax highlighting.

With these features, `re_highlight` enhances the readability of code snippets, making it an essential package for any Flutter developer dealing with code representation.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `re_highlight`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with `re_highlight`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  re_highlight: ^0.7.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using `re_highlight` in Your Flutter App

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use `re_highlight` to display a code snippet.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:re_highlight/re_highlight.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Syntax Highlighting Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ReHighlight(
            // The code snippet to highlight
            code: '''
              void main() {
                print('Hello, World!');
              }
            ''',
            // Specify the language for syntax highlighting
            language: 'dart',
            // Optional: Customize the theme
            theme: ReHighlightTheme(
              backgroundColor: Colors.black,
              textColor: Colors.white,
              keywordColor: Colors.blue,
              stringColor: Colors.green,
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays a Dart code snippet with syntax highlighting. The `ReHighlight` widget takes the code, the language, and an optional theme for customization.

# Complete Example of `re_highlight`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:re_highlight/re_highlight.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Syntax Highlighting Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ReHighlight(
            // The code snippet to highlight
            code: '''
              void main() {
                print('Hello, World!');
              }
            ''',
            // Specify the language for syntax highlighting
            language: 'dart',
            // Optional: Customize the theme
            theme: ReHighlightTheme(
              backgroundColor: Colors.black,
              textColor: Colors.white,
              keywordColor: Colors.blue,
              stringColor: Colors.green,
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The runApp function takes the RealFlutter widget and starts the app.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 4. The AppBar displays the title of the application.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 6. The ReHighlight widget is used to display the code snippet with syntax highlighting.
// 7. The code snippet is defined as a string and passed to the ReHighlight widget.
// 8. The language is set to 'dart' for proper syntax highlighting.
// 9. The theme is customized to have a black background and white text with specific colors for keywords and strings.
```
