# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `flutter_smart_dialog`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with `flutter_smart_dialog`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_smart_dialog: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Basic Setup

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` file to allow for certain features. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to show a basic dialog:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_smart_dialog/flutter_smart_dialog.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Smart Dialog Demo',
      builder: (context, child) {
        // Initialize the Smart Dialog
        SmartDialog.init();
        return child!;
      },
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home Page')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Show a simple dialog
            SmartDialog.show(
              builder: (context) {
                return AlertDialog(
                  title: Text('Hello'),
                  content: Text('This is a simple dialog.'),
                  actions: [
                    TextButton(
                      onPressed: () {
                        SmartDialog.dismiss();
                      },
                      child: Text('Close'),
                    ),
                  ],
                );
              },
            );
          },
          child: Text('Show Dialog'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**: The `SmartDialog.init()` method is called in the `builder` of the `MaterialApp` to initialize the dialog manager.
2. **Showing a Dialog**: When the button is pressed, `SmartDialog.show()` is called with a builder function that returns an `AlertDialog`.
3. **Dismissal**: The dialog can be dismissed by calling `SmartDialog.dismiss()` when the close button is pressed.

# Complete Example of `flutter_smart_dialog`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_smart_dialog/flutter_smart_dialog.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'RealFlutter Smart Dialog Demo',
      builder: (context, child) {
        // Initialize the Smart Dialog
        SmartDialog.init();
        return child!;
      },
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home Page')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Show a simple dialog
                SmartDialog.show(
                  builder: (context) {
                    return AlertDialog(
                      title: Text('Hello'),
                      content: Text('This is a simple dialog.'),
                      actions: [
                        TextButton(
                          onPressed: () {
                            SmartDialog.dismiss(); // Dismiss the dialog
                          },
                          child: Text('Close'),
                        ),
                      ],
                    );
                  },
                );
              },
              child: Text('Show Simple Dialog'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Show a loading dialog
                SmartDialog.showLoading(msg: 'Loading...');
                // Simulate a network request
                Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2), () {
                  SmartDialog.dismiss(); // Dismiss the loading dialog
                  SmartDialog.show(
                    builder: (context) {
                      return AlertDialog(
                        title: Text('Success'),
                        content: Text('Data loaded successfully!'),
                        actions: [
                          TextButton(
                            onPressed: () {
                              SmartDialog.dismiss(); // Dismiss the success dialog
                            },
                            child: Text('Close'),
                          ),
                        ],
                      );
                    },
                  );
                });
              },
              child: Text('Show Loading Dialog'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Explanation of the application flow:
// 1. The app starts with the `RealFlutter` class, which initializes the Smart Dialog.
// 2. The `HomePage` widget contains two buttons:
//    - The first button shows a simple alert dialog when pressed.
//    - The second button shows a loading dialog, simulating a network request.
// 3. After a delay of 2 seconds, the loading dialog is dismissed, and a success dialog is shown.
// 4. Each dialog can be dismissed by pressing the 'Close' button, which calls `SmartDialog.dismiss()`.
