# Snowplow Flutter Tracker: A Comprehensive Overview

The `snowplow_flutter_tracker` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to implement advanced event tracking and analytics in their applications. Built on the Snowplow Analytics framework, this package allows developers to collect and send event data to a Snowplow collector, enabling detailed insights into user behavior and application performance.

## When to Use This Package
- **User Behavior Tracking**: If you want to understand how users interact with your app, this package is ideal for tracking events such as button clicks, screen views, and custom events.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Use it to monitor app performance metrics, helping you identify bottlenecks and improve user experience.
- **A/B Testing**: Track user interactions during A/B tests to analyze the effectiveness of different features or designs.

## Key Features
- **Event Tracking**: Easily track various types of events, including screen views, structured events, and unstructured events.
- **Custom Context**: Attach custom context to events for richer data collection.
- **Session Management**: Automatically manage user sessions to ensure accurate tracking.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

With these features, the `snowplow_flutter_tracker` package provides a robust solution for integrating analytics into your Flutter applications.

# Setting Up and Using Snowplow Flutter Tracker

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `snowplow_flutter_tracker` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Installation

To get started, add the `snowplow_flutter_tracker` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  snowplow_flutter_tracker: ^<latest_version>
```

Make sure to replace `<latest_version>` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/snowplow_flutter_tracker).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure that you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version
    }
}
```

2. Add the Internet permission in the `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage

To use the `snowplow_flutter_tracker`, you need to initialize the tracker and start tracking events. Here’s how you can do it:

```dart
import 'package:snowplow_flutter_tracker/snowplow_flutter_tracker.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the Snowplow Tracker
  final tracker = SnowplowTracker(
    namespace: 'my_app',
    appId: 'my_app_id',
    collectorUri: 'https://your-collector-uri.com',
  );

  // Start tracking a screen view
  tracker.trackScreenView(screenName: 'Home Screen');
}
```

In this example, we initialize the tracker with a namespace, app ID, and collector URI. We then track a screen view event for the home screen.

# Complete Example of Snowplow Flutter Tracker

Here’s a complete Flutter application demonstrating the use of the `snowplow_flutter_tracker` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:snowplow_flutter_tracker/snowplow_flutter_tracker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Snowplow Tracker Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  late SnowplowTracker tracker;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the Snowplow Tracker
    tracker = SnowplowTracker(
      namespace: 'my_app',
      appId: 'my_app_id',
      collectorUri: 'https://your-collector-uri.com',
    );

    // Track the initial screen view
    tracker.trackScreenView(screenName: 'Home Screen');
  }

  void _trackButtonPress() {
    // Track a button press event
    tracker.trackStructuredEvent(
      category: 'Button',
      action: 'Press',
      label: 'Track Button',
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Snowplow Tracker Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            _trackButtonPress(); // Track button press
            ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
              SnackBar(content: Text('Button Pressed!')),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Track Button'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```
// This Flutter application demonstrates the use of the Snowplow Tracker.
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets the home screen.
// 2. The HomeScreen widget initializes the Snowplow Tracker in its initState method.
// 3. When the HomeScreen is built, it tracks a screen view event for the home screen.
// 4. The app contains a button that, when pressed, tracks a structured event indicating the button press.
// 5. A SnackBar is displayed to confirm the button press to the user.
```
