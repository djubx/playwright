# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `free_place_search`

## Installation
To get started with the `free_place_search` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  free_place_search: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/free_place_search).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request location permissions:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to find nearby places.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to find nearby places.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `free_place_search` package, you can create a simple search interface. Hereâ€™s how to implement it in your Flutter app:

1. Import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:free_place_search/free_place_search.dart';
```

2. Create a widget that utilizes the `FreePlaceSearch` class:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Place Search Example')),
        body: PlaceSearchWidget(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class PlaceSearchWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PlaceSearchWidgetState createState() => _PlaceSearchWidgetState();
}

class _PlaceSearchWidgetState extends State<PlaceSearchWidget> {
  // Initialize the FreePlaceSearch instance
  final FreePlaceSearch _placeSearch = FreePlaceSearch();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        TextField(
          onChanged: (query) {
            // Trigger the search when the user types
            _placeSearch.search(query);
          },
          decoration: InputDecoration(
            hintText: 'Search for places...',
          ),
        ),
        // Display search results here
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application with a search bar. As the user types in the search field, the `search` method of the `FreePlaceSearch` instance is called to fetch results.

# Complete Example of `free_place_search`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:free_place_search/free_place_search.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Place Search Example')),
        body: PlaceSearchWidget(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class PlaceSearchWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PlaceSearchWidgetState createState() => _PlaceSearchWidgetState();
}

class _PlaceSearchWidgetState extends State<PlaceSearchWidget> {
  // Initialize the FreePlaceSearch instance
  final FreePlaceSearch _placeSearch = FreePlaceSearch();
  List<Place> _places = []; // List to hold search results

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        TextField(
          onChanged: (query) {
            // Trigger the search when the user types
            _placeSearch.search(query).then((results) {
              setState(() {
                _places = results; // Update the state with search results
              });
            });
          },
          decoration: InputDecoration(
            hintText: 'Search for places...',
          ),
        ),
        Expanded(
          child: ListView.builder(
            itemCount: _places.length,
            itemBuilder: (context, index) {
              return ListTile(
                title: Text(_places[index].name), // Display place name
                subtitle: Text(_places[index].address), // Display place address
                onTap: () {
                  // Handle place selection
                  Navigator.push(
                    context,
                    MaterialPageRoute(
                      builder: (context) => PlaceDetailScreen(place: _places[index]),
                    ),
                  );
                },
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

class PlaceDetailScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final Place place;

  PlaceDetailScreen({required this.place});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text(place.name)),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Details for ${place.name}'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which sets up the MaterialApp and the main scaffold.
// 2. The PlaceSearchWidget is displayed, containing a TextField for user input and a ListView for displaying search results.
// 3. When the user types in the TextField, the search method of the FreePlaceSearch instance is called, fetching results asynchronously.
// 4. The results are stored in the _places list, and the UI is updated to display these results in a ListView.
// 5. When a user taps on a place from the list, the app navigates to a PlaceDetailScreen, showing more information about the selected place.
