# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Traversal Slider

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **traversal_slider** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **traversal_slider** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  traversal_slider: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Traversal Slider

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple example to demonstrate its usage. 

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:traversal_slider/traversal_slider.dart';
```

2. Create a new widget that uses the **TraversalSlider**:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Traversal Slider Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: TraversalSlider(
          items: [
            Container(color: Colors.red, child: Center(child: Text('Slide 1'))),
            Container(color: Colors.green, child: Center(child: Text('Slide 2'))),
            Container(color: Colors.blue, child: Center(child: Text('Slide 3'))),
          ],
          onChanged: (index) {
            print('Current index: $index');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Finally, run your application to see the traversal slider in action!

# Complete Example of Traversal Slider

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:traversal_slider/traversal_slider.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Traversal Slider Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Traversal Slider Example'), // Title of the app
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: TraversalSlider(
          items: [
            // Each item in the slider is a Container with a different color and text
            Container(color: Colors.red, child: Center(child: Text('Slide 1'))),
            Container(color: Colors.green, child: Center(child: Text('Slide 2'))),
            Container(color: Colors.blue, child: Center(child: Text('Slide 3'))),
          ],
          onChanged: (index) {
            // Callback function that gets called when the slider changes
            print('Current index: $index'); // Print the current index to the console
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with MyApp().
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme, setting RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a TraversalSlider is created with three colored slides.
// 5. The onChanged callback prints the current index of the slider to the console whenever the user slides to a new item.
```
