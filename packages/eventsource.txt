# EventSource Flutter Package

The `eventsource` package for Flutter provides a simple way to connect to server-sent events (SSE). This package is particularly useful for applications that require real-time updates from a server, such as chat applications, live notifications, or any scenario where data needs to be pushed from the server to the client without the need for constant polling.

## When to Use This Package
- **Real-time Applications**: Ideal for chat applications, live sports updates, or stock price tickers.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Useful in scenarios where the application needs to react to events pushed from the server.
- **Lightweight Communication**: When you want to minimize the overhead of WebSocket connections for simple event streams.

## Features
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API to connect and listen to events.
- **Automatic Reconnection**: Handles reconnections automatically if the connection drops.
- **Event Handling**: Provides a straightforward way to handle incoming events and errors.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the EventSource Package

## Installation
To use the `eventsource` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  eventsource: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No specific configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the appropriate permissions set in your `Info.plist` if you are connecting to a non-secure server (HTTP). Add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
Hereâ€™s how to use the `eventsource` package in your Flutter application:

1. Import the package.
2. Create an instance of `EventSource`.
3. Listen for events and handle them accordingly.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:eventsource/eventsource.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late EventSource eventSource;
  String eventData = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the EventSource with the URL of the server
    eventSource = EventSource('https://your-server.com/events');

    // Listen for messages from the server
    eventSource.listen((Event event) {
      setState(() {
        eventData = event.data; // Update the state with the new event data
      });
    }, onError: (error) {
      print('Error: $error'); // Handle any errors
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    eventSource.close(); // Close the EventSource when the widget is disposed
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('EventSource Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(eventData.isEmpty ? 'Waiting for events...' : eventData),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a simple Flutter application that listens for server-sent events and displays them on the screen.

# Complete Example of Using the EventSource Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:eventsource/eventsource.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late EventSource eventSource; // Declare the EventSource variable
  String eventData = ''; // Variable to hold the event data

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the EventSource with the URL of the server
    eventSource = EventSource('https://your-server.com/events');

    // Listen for messages from the server
    eventSource.listen((Event event) {
      setState(() {
        eventData = event.data; // Update the state with the new event data
      });
    }, onError: (error) {
      print('Error: $error'); // Handle any errors
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    eventSource.close(); // Close the EventSource when the widget is disposed
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('EventSource Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(eventData.isEmpty ? 'Waiting for events...' : eventData),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    home: RealFlutter(), // Run the RealFlutter widget
  ));
}
```

// The application starts by running the main function, which initializes the Flutter app.
// The RealFlutter widget is created, which sets up an EventSource connection to the specified URL.
// In the initState method, the EventSource is initialized and listens for incoming events.
// When an event is received, the event data is updated in the state, causing the UI to rebuild.
// If an error occurs, it is printed to the console.
// The dispose method ensures that the EventSource connection is closed when the widget is removed from the widget tree.
// The build method displays the current event data or a waiting message if no data has been received yet.
