# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Sealed Countries Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `sealed_countries` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  sealed_countries: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:sealed_countries/sealed_countries.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package

You can now use the `sealed_countries` package to access country data. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to retrieve a list of countries:

```dart
void main() {
  // Retrieve all countries
  final countries = SealedCountries.all;
  // Print country names
  countries.forEach((country) {
    print(country.name);
  });
}
```

This code snippet retrieves all countries and prints their names to the console.

# Complete Example of Using the Sealed Countries Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sealed_countries/sealed_countries.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sealed Countries Example',
      home: CountrySelectionScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class CountrySelectionScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CountrySelectionScreenState createState() => _CountrySelectionScreenState();
}

class _CountrySelectionScreenState extends State<CountrySelectionScreen> {
  // Variable to hold the selected country
  String? selectedCountry;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Select a Country'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: DropdownButton<String>(
          // Display the selected country or a placeholder
          value: selectedCountry,
          hint: Text('Select a country'),
          items: SealedCountries.all.map((country) {
            return DropdownMenuItem<String>(
              value: country.code, // Use country code as the value
              child: Text(country.name), // Display country name
            );
          }).toList(),
          onChanged: (value) {
            setState(() {
              selectedCountry = value; // Update the selected country
            });
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets MyApp as the home widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. CountrySelectionScreen is a stateful widget that manages the selected country.
// 4. A DropdownButton is created to display the list of countries.
// 5. When a country is selected, the state is updated, and the selected country is displayed.
```

// The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `MyApp` widget. 
// `MyApp` sets up a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen, `CountrySelectionScreen`.
// In `CountrySelectionScreen`, a `DropdownButton` is used to allow users to select a country from the list provided by the `sealed_countries` package.
// When a user selects a country, the `onChanged` callback updates the `selectedCountry` state, which reflects the user's choice in the dropdown.
 
// This simple application demonstrates how to integrate the `sealed_countries` package to create a user-friendly country selection interface.
