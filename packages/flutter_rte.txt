# Setting Up and Using the `flutter_rte` Package

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_rte` package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_rte` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_rte: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_rte).

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` file to allow for certain functionalities. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `RealFlutter` class with the `flutter_rte` package.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_rte/flutter_rte.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter RTE Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter RTE Example'),
        ),
        body: RichTextEditor(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class RichTextEditor extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RichTextEditorState createState() => _RichTextEditorState();
}

class _RichTextEditorState extends State<RichTextEditor> {
  // Create a controller for the rich text editor
  final RteController _controller = RteController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        // Rich Text Editor widget
        Expanded(
          child: Rte(
            controller: _controller,
            toolbar: RteToolbar(
              // Customize the toolbar with desired options
              options: [
                RteToolbarOption.bold,
                RteToolbarOption.italic,
                RteToolbarOption.underline,
                RteToolbarOption.link,
              ],
            ),
          ),
        ),
        // Button to print the content of the editor
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Print the current content of the editor
            print(_controller.text);
          },
          child: Text('Print Content'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and the RichTextEditor.
// 3. The RichTextEditor widget is a StatefulWidget that manages the state of the rich text editor.
// 4. Inside the RichTextEditor, an RteController is created to control the editor's content.
// 5. The Rte widget is used to display the rich text editor, with a customizable toolbar for text formatting options.
// 6. An ElevatedButton is provided to print the current content of the editor to the console when pressed.
```
