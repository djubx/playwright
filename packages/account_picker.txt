# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Account Picker Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **account_picker** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  account_picker: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/account_picker).

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add:

```xml
<key>NSContactsUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your contacts to select accounts.</string>
```

## Step 4: Using the Account Picker

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the account picker in your app:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:account_picker/account_picker.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: AccountPickerExample(),
    );
  }
}

class AccountPickerExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _AccountPickerExampleState createState() => _AccountPickerExampleState();
}

class _AccountPickerExampleState extends State<AccountPickerExample> {
  String? selectedAccount;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Account Picker Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text(
              selectedAccount ?? 'No account selected',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () async {
                // Open the account picker
                final account = await AccountPicker.showAccountPicker(context);
                if (account != null) {
                  setState(() {
                    selectedAccount = account;
                  });
                }
              },
              child: Text('Pick an Account'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that allows users to pick an account. The selected account is displayed on the screen.

# Complete Example of Account Picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:account_picker/account_picker.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: AccountPickerExample(),
    );
  }
}

class AccountPickerExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _AccountPickerExampleState createState() => _AccountPickerExampleState();
}

class _AccountPickerExampleState extends State<AccountPickerExample> {
  String? selectedAccount; // Variable to hold the selected account

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Account Picker Example'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text(
              selectedAccount ?? 'No account selected', // Display selected account or a default message
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between text and button
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () async {
                // Open the account picker when the button is pressed
                final account = await AccountPicker.showAccountPicker(context);
                if (account != null) {
                  setState(() {
                    selectedAccount = account; // Update the selected account
                  });
                }
              },
              child: Text('Pick an Account'), // Button text
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The AccountPickerExample widget is displayed as the home screen.
// 3. The user sees a message indicating no account is selected initially.
// 4. When the user presses the "Pick an Account" button, the account picker dialog opens.
// 5. After selecting an account, the selected account is displayed on the screen.
// 6. The app updates the UI to reflect the selected account using setState.
```
