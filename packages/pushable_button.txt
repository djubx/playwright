**Setting Up the Pushable Button Package**
--------------------------------------------

To use the `pushable_button` package in your Flutter application, follow these steps:

1. Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  pushable_button: ^1.0.0
```
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.
3. Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:pushable_button/pushable_button.dart';
```
**Using the Pushable Button Widget**
--------------------------------------

To use the `PushableButton` widget, simply create an instance of the widget and pass in the required properties:
```dart
PushableButton(
  child: Text('Click me!'),
  onPressed: () {
    print('Button pressed!');
  },
)
```
**Platform-Specific Details**
-----------------------------

The `pushable_button` package is compatible with both Android and iOS platforms. However, there are some platform-specific details to note:

* On Android, the 3D effect may not work properly if the button is placed inside a `Stack` widget.
* On iOS, the button may not respond to touch events if it is placed inside a `GestureDetector` widget.

**Configurations and Optimizations**
--------------------------------------

To optimize the performance of the `PushableButton` widget, you can try the following:

* Use a `CachedNetworkImage` widget to load images instead of loading them directly.
* Avoid using too many `PushableButton` widgets in a single screen.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pushable_button/pushable_button.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Pushable Button Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Pushable Button Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: PushableButton(
            child: Text('Click me!'),
            onPressed: () {
              print('Button pressed!');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a screen containing a single button.
// 2. The button is a PushableButton widget, which is a customizable widget that allows developers to create buttons with a 3D effect.
// 3. When the user clicks the button, the onPressed callback is triggered, which prints a message to the console.
// 4. The button is placed inside a Center widget, which centers it horizontally and vertically on the screen.
// 5. The entire screen is wrapped in a Scaffold widget, which provides a basic material design layout structure.
// 6. The Scaffold widget contains an AppBar widget, which displays the title of the app.
// 7. The app uses the Material theme, which provides a set of pre-defined styles and layouts for material design apps.

// In summary, this code creates a simple Flutter app that demonstrates the use of the PushableButton widget.
// The app displays a single button on the screen, which responds to touch events and prints a message to the console when clicked.
