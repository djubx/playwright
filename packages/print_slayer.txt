// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a screen containing two buttons: "Print" and "Print with Custom Settings".
// 2. When the user clicks the "Print" button, the `printSlayer` instance is used to print the string "Hello, World!" with the default print settings.
// 3. When the user clicks the "Print with Custom Settings" button, the `printSlayer` instance is used to print the string "Hello, World!" with custom print settings (font size 18 and landscape orientation).
// 4. The `printSlayer` instance is created and configured in the `initState` method of the `_RealFlutterState` class.
// 5. The `printSlayer` instance is used to print the data in the `onPressed` callback of the buttons.
