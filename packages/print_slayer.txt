# Overview of the print_slayer Flutter Package

The `print_slayer` package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who want to manage and control the output of print statements in their applications. This package allows developers to filter, format, and redirect print outputs, making debugging and logging more efficient and organized.

## When to Use `print_slayer`

- **Debugging**: When you need to manage a large number of print statements and want to filter them based on severity or context.
- **Logging**: If you want to redirect print outputs to different destinations, such as files or external logging services.
- **Performance**: To improve performance by controlling when and how much information is printed to the console.

## Key Features

- **Filtering**: Easily filter print statements based on tags or severity levels.
- **Redirection**: Redirect print outputs to different destinations, such as files or remote servers.
- **Formatting**: Customize the format of print outputs for better readability.
- **Performance Optimization**: Control the verbosity of print statements to enhance application performance.

# Setting Up and Using the print_slayer Package

## Installation

To use the `print_slayer` package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  print_slayer: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, no additional configuration is required. The package works out of the box.

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that you have the necessary permissions set in your `Info.plist` file if you plan to log to external services or files. You may need to add:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save logs.</string>
```

## Basic Usage

To start using `print_slayer`, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:print_slayer/print_slayer.dart';
```

You can then initialize the `PrintSlayer` class and start using its features:

```dart
void main() {
  // Initialize PrintSlayer
  PrintSlayer.init();

  // Example of using print_slayer
  PrintSlayer.log('This is a log message', tag: 'INFO');
  PrintSlayer.log('This is an error message', tag: 'ERROR');
}
```

You can filter messages by severity or tag, redirect them, and format them as needed.

# Complete Example of Using print_slayer

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:print_slayer/print_slayer.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the PrintSlayer package
  PrintSlayer.init();

  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Print Slayer Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Print Slayer Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Log an info message
              PrintSlayer.log('Button Pressed!', tag: 'INFO');
              // Log a warning message
              PrintSlayer.log('This is a warning!', tag: 'WARNING');
              // Log an error message
              PrintSlayer.log('An error occurred!', tag: 'ERROR');
            },
            child: Text('Press Me'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the PrintSlayer package.
// 2. The MyApp widget is created, which builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The app contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, there is an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, three log messages are generated:
//    - An info message indicating the button was pressed.
//    - A warning message.
//    - An error message.
// 6. These messages are processed by the PrintSlayer package, which handles filtering and formatting.
```
