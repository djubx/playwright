# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Cubixd

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the Cubixd package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding Cubixd to Your Project

To get started, you need to add the Cubixd package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cubixd: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/cubixd).

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing Cubixd

In your Dart files, import the Cubixd package:

```dart
import 'package:cubixd/cubixd.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using Cubixd Widgets

You can now start using Cubixd widgets in your Flutter application. For example, you can create a responsive layout using the `ResponsiveContainer` widget:

```dart
ResponsiveContainer(
  child: Text('Hello, Cubixd!'),
);
```

This widget will automatically adjust its size based on the screen dimensions.

## Conclusion

With these steps, you have successfully set up the Cubixd package in your Flutter project. You can now explore its features and start building responsive and animated user interfaces.

# Complete Example of Using Cubixd

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cubixd/cubixd.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Cubixd Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Cubixd Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ResponsiveContainer(
            // This container will adjust its size based on the screen size
            width: 300,
            height: 200,
            color: Colors.blue,
            child: Column(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              children: [
                Text(
                  'Welcome to Cubixd!',
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24),
                ),
                SizedBox(height: 20),
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () {
                    // Trigger an animation when the button is pressed
                    Navigator.push(
                      context,
                      MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => AnimationPage()),
                    );
                  },
                  child: Text('Start Animation'),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class AnimationPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Animation Page'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: CubixdAnimation(
          // Using Cubixd's animation widget
          duration: Duration(seconds: 2),
          child: Container(
            width: 100,
            height: 100,
            color: Colors.red,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds a ResponsiveContainer.
// 4. Inside the ResponsiveContainer, a welcome message and a button are displayed.
// 5. When the button is pressed, it navigates to the AnimationPage.
// 6. The AnimationPage displays a red container that animates over 2 seconds using Cubixd's animation widget.
```
