# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Console Bars

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **console_bars** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  console_bars: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:console_bars/console_bars.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using Console Bars

You can now use the console bars in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a linear progress bar:

```dart
LinearProgressBar(
  value: 0.5, // Set the progress value between 0.0 and 1.0
  backgroundColor: Colors.grey[300],
  valueColor: AlwaysStoppedAnimation<Color>(Colors.blue),
)
```

This will create a linear progress bar that is half-filled. You can adjust the `value`, `backgroundColor`, and `valueColor` properties to customize the appearance.

# Complete Example of Console Bars in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:console_bars/console_bars.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Console Bars Example',
      home: ProgressScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ProgressScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ProgressScreenState createState() => _ProgressScreenState();
}

class _ProgressScreenState extends State<ProgressScreen> {
  double _progress = 0.0; // Variable to hold the progress value

  // Function to simulate a long-running task
  void _startProgress() {
    // Reset progress to 0
    setState(() {
      _progress = 0.0;
    });

    // Simulate a task that takes 5 seconds
    for (int i = 0; i <= 100; i++) {
      Future.delayed(Duration(milliseconds: 50 * i), () {
        // Update progress value
        setState(() {
          _progress = i / 100; // Update progress value
        });
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Console Bars Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display the linear progress bar
            LinearProgressBar(
              value: _progress, // Set the current progress value
              backgroundColor: Colors.grey[300], // Background color of the bar
              valueColor: AlwaysStoppedAnimation<Color>(Colors.blue), // Color of the filled part
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Add some space
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _startProgress, // Start the progress when button is pressed
              child: Text('Start Progress'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (ProgressScreen).
// 3. ProgressScreen is a stateful widget that manages the progress state.
// 4. The _startProgress function simulates a long-running task by updating the progress value.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the progress bar updates in real-time, reflecting the task's progress.
// 6. The LinearProgressBar widget visually represents the progress based on the _progress variable.
