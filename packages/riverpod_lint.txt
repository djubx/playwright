# Setting Up and Using `riverpod_lint`

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `riverpod_lint` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter projects.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add `riverpod_lint` to your `dev_dependencies` in the `pubspec.yaml` file of your Flutter project:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  riverpod_lint: ^1.0.0
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Configuring Lint Rules

Next, you need to create a `analysis_options.yaml` file in the root of your project if it doesn't already exist. This file will contain the configuration for the lint rules you want to enforce. Hereâ€™s an example configuration:

```yaml
include: package:riverpod_lint/analysis_options.yaml
```

This line includes the default lint rules provided by `riverpod_lint`.

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Considerations

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Running the Linter

To run the linter, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
flutter analyze
```

This command will analyze your code and provide feedback based on the lint rules defined in your `analysis_options.yaml` file.

## Step 5: Fixing Lint Issues

As you develop your application, pay attention to the lint warnings and errors provided by the linter. Address these issues to improve your code quality and adhere to best practices.

By following these steps, you can effectively set up and use the `riverpod_lint` package in your Flutter projects, ensuring a cleaner and more maintainable codebase.

# Complete Example of Using `riverpod_lint`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';

// Define a simple provider that holds an integer value
final counterProvider = StateProvider<int>((ref) => 0);

void main() {
  runApp(
    // Wrap the app with ProviderScope to enable Riverpod
    ProviderScope(
      child: MyApp(),
    ),
  );
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Riverpod Lint Example',
      home: CounterScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class CounterScreen extends ConsumerWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    // Read the current value of the counter from the provider
    final counter = ref.watch(counterProvider);

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Counter Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text(
              'Counter Value: $counter',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Update the counter value when the button is pressed
                ref.read(counterProvider.notifier).state++;
              },
              child: Text('Increment Counter'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by wrapping it in a ProviderScope.
// 2. MyApp is the root widget that sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. CounterScreen is a ConsumerWidget that listens to the counterProvider.
// 4. The current counter value is displayed in the center of the screen.
// 5. When the "Increment Counter" button is pressed, the counter value is incremented.
// 6. The UI automatically updates to reflect the new counter value due to Riverpod's state management.
```
