# Introduction to the "barras" Flutter Package
=============================================

The "barras" Flutter package is a lightweight library that provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for displaying progress bars in Flutter applications. It is designed to be highly customizable, allowing developers to tailor the appearance and behavior of the progress bars to suit their specific needs.

### When to Use the "barras" Package

The "barras" package is ideal for situations where you need to display a progress bar in your Flutter application, such as:

* During network requests or data loading
* When performing time-consuming computations or operations
* To indicate progress during file uploads or downloads

### Key Features of the "barras" Package

* Highly customizable progress bars with support for various styles and themes
* Support for both determinate and indeterminate progress bars
* Easy-to-use API for displaying and managing progress bars

# Setting Up and Using the "barras" Package
=============================================

### Step 1: Add the "barras" Package to Your Flutter Project

To use the "barras" package in your Flutter project, add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  barras: ^1.0.0
```
Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the "barras" Package

In your Dart file, import the "barras" package:
```dart
import 'package:barras/barras.dart';
```
### Step 3: Create a Progress Bar

To create a progress bar, use the `Barra` widget:
```dart
Barra(
  value: 0.5, // progress value (0.0 to 1.0)
  color: Colors.blue, // progress bar color
  backgroundColor: Colors.grey, // background color
)
```
You can customize the appearance and behavior of the progress bar by using various properties, such as `style`, `animationDuration`, and `onChanged`.

### Platform-Specific Details

* On Android, the "barras" package uses the `ProgressBar` widget to display the progress bar.
* On iOS, the "barras" package uses the `UIProgressView` widget to display the progress bar.

### Required Configurations or Optimizations

* To ensure smooth animation, set the `animationDuration` property to a non-zero value.
* To display a determinate progress bar, set the `value` property to a value between 0.0 and 1.0.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:barras/barras.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  double _progressValue = 0.0;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'barras Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('barras Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Barra(
                value: _progressValue,
                color: Colors.blue,
                backgroundColor: Colors.grey,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  setState(() {
                    _progressValue += 0.1;
                    if (_progressValue > 1.0) {
                      _progressValue = 0.0;
                    }
                  });
                },
                child: Text('Increment Progress'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and sees a progress bar with a value of 0.0.
// 2. The user clicks the "Increment Progress" button, which increments the progress value by 0.1.
// 3. The progress bar is updated to reflect the new progress value.
// 4. Steps 2-3 repeat until the progress value reaches 1.0, at which point it resets to 0.0.
// This demonstrates a basic example of using the "barras" package to display a progress bar.

// In summary, the code flows as follows:
// - The user interacts with the app by clicking the "Increment Progress" button.
// - The button click triggers a state update, which increments the progress value.
// - The progress bar is updated to reflect the new progress value.
// - The app continues to run and respond to user input until it is closed.
