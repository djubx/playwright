# Setting Up and Using `flutter_acrylic`

In this tutorial, we'll walk through the setup process for the `flutter_acrylic` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter project. We'll cover platform-specific details for Windows and macOS.

## Setup Process

1. **Add Dependency**: First, add the `flutter_acrylic` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     flutter_acrylic: ^0.1.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Windows**: Ensure your project is set up for Windows development. You may need to enable desktop support by running `flutter config --enable-windows-desktop`.
   - **macOS**: Similarly, ensure your project is configured for macOS. Use `flutter config --enable-macos-desktop` if necessary.

## Using `flutter_acrylic`

1. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the `flutter_acrylic` package.

   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter_acrylic/flutter_acrylic.dart';
   ```

2. **Initialize the Package**: Before using any acrylic effects, initialize the package in your `main` function.

   ```dart
   void main() async {
     WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
     await Window.initialize();
     runApp(MyApp());
   }
   ```

3. **Apply Acrylic Effect**: Use the `Window` class to apply the acrylic effect.

   ```dart
   Window.setEffect(
     effect: WindowEffect.acrylic,
     color: Color(0xCCFFFFFF), // Tint color
   );
   ```

## Optimizations

- **Performance**: Acrylic effects can be performance-intensive. Test your application on target devices to ensure smooth performance.
- **Fallbacks**: Consider providing a fallback UI for platforms that do not support acrylic effects.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_acrylic/flutter_acrylic.dart';

void main() async {
  // Ensure that widget binding is initialized
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  // Initialize the Window for acrylic effects
  await Window.initialize();
  // Run the main application
  runApp(RealFlutterApp());
}

class RealFlutterApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Acrylic Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: AcrylicHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class AcrylicHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _AcrylicHomePageState createState() => _AcrylicHomePageState();
}

class _AcrylicHomePageState extends State<AcrylicHomePage> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Set the acrylic effect when the widget is initialized
    Window.setEffect(
      effect: WindowEffect.acrylic,
      color: Color(0xCCFFFFFF), // Set the tint color
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Acrylic Effect Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Hello, Acrylic!',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The application starts by initializing the Flutter widget binding and the Window for acrylic effects.
// The `RealFlutterApp` is the main widget, which sets up the MaterialApp with a home page.
// The `AcrylicHomePage` widget is a stateful widget where the acrylic effect is applied in the `initState` method.
// The `Window.setEffect` method is used to apply the acrylic effect with a specified tint color.
// The UI consists of a simple AppBar and a centered text widget displaying "Hello, Acrylic!".
