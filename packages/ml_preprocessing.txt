# Overview of the ml_preprocessing Flutter Package

The `ml_preprocessing` package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who are working on machine learning applications. This package provides a set of utilities for preprocessing data, which is a crucial step in any machine learning pipeline. Preprocessing can include tasks such as normalization, encoding categorical variables, and handling missing values, all of which are essential for preparing data for model training.

## When to Use `ml_preprocessing`

You should consider using the `ml_preprocessing` package when:
- You are building a Flutter application that involves machine learning.
- You need to preprocess datasets before feeding them into a machine learning model.
- You want to streamline the data preparation process with reusable functions.

## Key Features
- **Normalization**: Scale your data to a specific range, which is essential for many machine learning algorithms.
- **Encoding**: Convert categorical variables into numerical format, making them suitable for model training.
- **Handling Missing Values**: Provide strategies to deal with missing data, ensuring your dataset is complete.
- **Pipeline Support**: Create a preprocessing pipeline to apply multiple transformations in a sequence.

Overall, the `ml_preprocessing` package simplifies the data preparation process, making it easier for developers to focus on building and training their machine learning models.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `ml_preprocessing`

## Installation

To get started with the `ml_preprocessing` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ml_preprocessing: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter and iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package

Once the package is installed, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the `ml_preprocessing` package to normalize a dataset and encode categorical variables.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ml_preprocessing/ml_preprocessing.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample dataset
    List<Map<String, dynamic>> dataset = [
      {'feature1': 1.0, 'feature2': 'A'},
      {'feature1': 2.0, 'feature2': 'B'},
      {'feature1': 3.0, 'feature2': 'A'},
      {'feature1': null, 'feature2': 'C'},
    ];

    // Handling missing values
    var filledDataset = handleMissingValues(dataset, 'feature1', fillValue: 0.0);

    // Encoding categorical variables
    var encodedDataset = encodeCategorical(filledDataset, 'feature2');

    // Normalizing the feature
    var normalizedDataset = normalize(encodedDataset, 'feature1');

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('ML Preprocessing Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Processed Dataset: $normalizedDataset'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we:
1. Created a sample dataset with some missing values.
2. Handled missing values by filling them with a specified value.
3. Encoded categorical variables into numerical format.
4. Normalized the numerical feature to a specific range.

# Complete Example of Using `ml_preprocessing`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ml_preprocessing/ml_preprocessing.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample dataset with some missing values
    List<Map<String, dynamic>> dataset = [
      {'feature1': 1.0, 'feature2': 'A'},
      {'feature1': 2.0, 'feature2': 'B'},
      {'feature1': 3.0, 'feature2': 'A'},
      {'feature1': null, 'feature2': 'C'},
    ];

    // Step 1: Handle missing values in 'feature1' by filling with 0.0
    var filledDataset = handleMissingValues(dataset, 'feature1', fillValue: 0.0);

    // Step 2: Encode categorical variable 'feature2' into numerical format
    var encodedDataset = encodeCategorical(filledDataset, 'feature2');

    // Step 3: Normalize 'feature1' to a range of [0, 1]
    var normalizedDataset = normalize(encodedDataset, 'feature1');

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('ML Preprocessing Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Display the processed dataset
          child: Text('Processed Dataset: $normalizedDataset'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts by creating a sample dataset with some missing values in 'feature1'.
// 2. The `handleMissingValues` function is called to fill in the missing values with 0.0.
// 3. The `encodeCategorical` function is used to convert the categorical variable 'feature2' into numerical format.
// 4. The `normalize` function normalizes the 'feature1' values to a range of [0, 1].
// 5. Finally, the processed dataset is displayed in the center of the app's main screen.
