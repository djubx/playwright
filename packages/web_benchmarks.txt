# Overview of the web_benchmarks Flutter Package

The `web_benchmarks` package is a specialized tool designed for Flutter developers to measure and analyze the performance of web applications built with Flutter. This package provides a suite of benchmarks that can help developers identify performance bottlenecks and optimize their applications for better user experience.

## When to Use This Package
- **Performance Testing**: When you need to evaluate the performance of your Flutter web applications.
- **Optimization**: To identify areas in your application that require optimization.
- **Comparative Analysis**: When comparing the performance of different implementations or libraries within your Flutter web app.

## Key Features
- **Comprehensive Benchmarks**: Includes various benchmarks that cover different aspects of web performance.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to add to your existing Flutter web project.
- **Detailed Reporting**: Provides detailed reports on performance metrics, making it easier to understand where improvements can be made.

By utilizing the `web_benchmarks` package, developers can ensure that their Flutter web applications run smoothly and efficiently, providing a better experience for end-users.

# Setting Up and Using the web_benchmarks Package

## Installation
To get started with the `web_benchmarks` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  web_benchmarks: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/web_benchmarks).

## Platform-Specific Details
### For Web
- Ensure that your Flutter environment is set up for web development. You can check this by running `flutter doctor` in your terminal.
- The package is designed to work seamlessly with Flutter web applications, so no additional configurations are required.

### For Android and iOS
- While the primary focus of the `web_benchmarks` package is on web applications, you can still use it in your Flutter projects targeting Android and iOS. However, the benchmarks will primarily reflect web performance.

## Basic Usage
Once you have installed the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:web_benchmarks/web_benchmarks.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Web Benchmarks Example',
      home: BenchmarkHome(),
    );
  }
}

class BenchmarkHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _BenchmarkHomeState createState() => _BenchmarkHomeState();
}

class _BenchmarkHomeState extends State<BenchmarkHome> {
  // Variable to hold benchmark results
  String _results = '';

  // Method to run benchmarks
  void _runBenchmarks() async {
    // Start the benchmark
    final results = await WebBenchmarks.run();
    setState(() {
      _results = results.toString();
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Web Benchmarks')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _runBenchmarks,
              child: Text('Run Benchmarks'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text('Results: $_results'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter web application that allows users to run benchmarks and display the results on the screen.

# Complete Example of Using web_benchmarks

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:web_benchmarks/web_benchmarks.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Main application class
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Web Benchmarks Example',
      home: BenchmarkHome(),
    );
  }
}

// Home widget for the benchmark
class BenchmarkHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _BenchmarkHomeState createState() => _BenchmarkHomeState();
}

// State class for BenchmarkHome
class _BenchmarkHomeState extends State<BenchmarkHome> {
  // Variable to hold benchmark results
  String _results = '';

  // Method to run benchmarks
  void _runBenchmarks() async {
    // Start the benchmark and await results
    final results = await WebBenchmarks.run();
    setState(() {
      // Update the results variable with the benchmark results
      _results = results.toString();
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Web Benchmarks')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Button to trigger benchmark run
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _runBenchmarks,
              child: Text('Run Benchmarks'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Display benchmark results
            Text('Results: $_results'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets BenchmarkHome as the home widget.
// 3. BenchmarkHome is a stateful widget that manages the benchmark results.
// 4. When the user presses the "Run Benchmarks" button, the _runBenchmarks method is called.
// 5. This method runs the benchmarks asynchronously and updates the _results variable with the output.
// 6. The UI is updated to display the benchmark results on the screen.
```
