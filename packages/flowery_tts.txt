# Tutorial: Setting Up Flowery TTS

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the Flowery TTS package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the Flowery TTS package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flowery_tts: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21  // Minimum SDK version required
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to the microphone for text-to-speech functionality.</string>
```

## Step 3: Import the Package
In your Dart file, import the Flowery TTS package:

```dart
import 'package:flowery_tts/flowery_tts.dart';
```

## Step 4: Initialize and Use Flowery TTS
You can now initialize and use the Flowery TTS in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use it:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: TextToSpeechDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class TextToSpeechDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _TextToSpeechDemoState createState() => _TextToSpeechDemoState();
}

class _TextToSpeechDemoState extends State<TextToSpeechDemo> {
  final FloweryTTS _tts = FloweryTTS();

  void _speak(String text) async {
    await _tts.speak(text);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flowery TTS Demo')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () => _speak("Hello, welcome to Flowery TTS!"),
          child: Text('Speak'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a simple Flutter application that speaks a greeting when the button is pressed.

# Complete Example of Flowery TTS

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flowery_tts/flowery_tts.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flowery TTS Example',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: TextToSpeechDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class TextToSpeechDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _TextToSpeechDemoState createState() => _TextToSpeechDemoState();
}

class _TextToSpeechDemoState extends State<TextToSpeechDemo> {
  final FloweryTTS _tts = FloweryTTS(); // Initialize the Flowery TTS instance

  // Function to speak the provided text
  void _speak(String text) async {
    await _tts.speak(text); // Call the speak method from Flowery TTS
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flowery TTS Demo')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () => _speak("Hello, welcome to Flowery TTS!"), // Speak when button is pressed
          child: Text('Speak'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme, and specifies the home widget as TextToSpeechDemo.
// 3. TextToSpeechDemo is a stateful widget that manages the text-to-speech functionality.
// 4. Inside _TextToSpeechDemoState, an instance of FloweryTTS is created.
// 5. The _speak method is defined to call the speak method of the Flowery TTS instance.
// 6. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a centered ElevatedButton.
// 7. When the button is pressed, the _speak method is called, which triggers the TTS to read the specified text aloud.
```
