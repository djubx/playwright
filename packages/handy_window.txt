# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Handy Window

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **handy_window** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  handy_window: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### For Android

1. Open the `AndroidManifest.xml` file located in `android/app/src/main/`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW"/>
```

### For iOS

1. Open the `Info.plist` file located in `ios/Runner/`.
2. Add the following key-value pair to request permission for window management:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for better experience.</string>
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:handy_window/handy_window.dart';
```

## Step 4: Basic Usage

You can now use the **handy_window** package in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a resizable and draggable window:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Handy Window Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Initialize the handy window
              HandyWindow.setWindowSize(800, 600);
              HandyWindow.setWindowPosition(100, 100);
              HandyWindow.setResizable(true);
              HandyWindow.setDraggable(true);
            },
            child: Text('Open Window'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code initializes a window with a size of 800x600 pixels, positioned at (100, 100) on the screen, and allows it to be resizable and draggable.

# Complete Example of Handy Window

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:handy_window/handy_window.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Handy Window Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Initialize the handy window
              HandyWindow.setWindowSize(800, 600); // Set the window size
              HandyWindow.setWindowPosition(100, 100); // Set the window position
              HandyWindow.setResizable(true); // Allow resizing
              HandyWindow.setDraggable(true); // Allow dragging
            },
            child: Text('Open Window'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the Flutter application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the HandyWindow methods are called to set the window size, position, and properties.
// 5. The window will open with the specified size and position, and users can resize and drag it around the screen.
```
