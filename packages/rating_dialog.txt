# Rating Dialog Flutter Package

The `rating_dialog` Flutter package is a powerful tool for integrating rating dialogs into your Flutter applications. It provides a user-friendly interface for collecting feedback from users, allowing them to rate your app or specific features easily. This package is particularly useful for developers looking to enhance user engagement and gather valuable insights into their applications.

## When to Use

You might consider using the `rating_dialog` package in scenarios such as:
- **Post-Interaction Feedback**: After a user completes a significant action (like a purchase or a level completion), prompt them to rate their experience.
- **App Store Ratings**: Encourage users to rate your app on the app store, which can help improve visibility and downloads.
- **Feature Feedback**: Gather user opinions on new features or updates to understand their impact.

## Features

- **Customizable Dialog**: The dialog can be tailored to fit the design of your application.
- **Multiple Rating Options**: Users can rate using stars, emojis, or any custom widget.
- **Feedback Collection**: Optionally, you can collect textual feedback along with the rating.

# Tutorial: Setting Up the Rating Dialog Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `rating_dialog` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `rating_dialog` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  rating_dialog: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:rating_dialog/rating_dialog.dart';
```

## Step 3: Implementing the Rating Dialog

You can trigger the rating dialog at any point in your application. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` has the necessary permissions if you plan to collect feedback that requires internet access.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to configure your app's `Info.plist` to allow for any specific features you want to implement, such as network access for sending feedback.

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Using the Rating Dialog

You can create and show the rating dialog as follows:

```dart
void showRatingDialog(BuildContext context) {
  final _dialog = RatingDialog(
    initialRating: 3.0,
    title: 'Rate our app',
    message: 'Please rate our app to help us improve!',
    submitButtonText: 'Submit',
    onSubmitted: (response) {
      // Handle the response here
      print('Rating: ${response.rating}, Comment: ${response.comment}');
    },
  );

  showDialog(
    context: context,
    builder: (context) => _dialog,
  );
}
```

You can call `showRatingDialog(context)` whenever you want to prompt the user for feedback.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the `rating_dialog` package into your Flutter application effectively.

# Complete Example of Using the Rating Dialog Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:rating_dialog/rating_dialog.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Rating Dialog Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Rating Dialog Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Call the function to show the rating dialog
              showRatingDialog(context);
            },
            child: Text('Rate Us'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void showRatingDialog(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a new RatingDialog instance
    final _dialog = RatingDialog(
      initialRating: 3.0, // Set the initial rating to 3 stars
      title: 'Rate our app', // Title of the dialog
      message: 'Please rate our app to help us improve!', // Message displayed in the dialog
      submitButtonText: 'Submit', // Text for the submit button
      onSubmitted: (response) {
        // Handle the response when the user submits their rating
        print('Rating: ${response.rating}, Comment: ${response.comment}');
      },
    );

    // Show the dialog
    showDialog(
      context: context,
      builder: (context) => _dialog, // Use the dialog we created
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, there's a Center widget containing an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the showRatingDialog function is called.
// 5. The showRatingDialog function creates a RatingDialog instance with an initial rating and a message.
// 6. The dialog is displayed using showDialog, allowing the user to rate the app.
// 7. Upon submission, the rating and comment are printed to the console.
