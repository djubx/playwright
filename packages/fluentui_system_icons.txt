# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the FluentUI System Icons Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `fluentui_system_icons` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  fluentui_system_icons: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the icons, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:fluentui_system_icons/fluentui_system_icons.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using Icons in Your Application

You can now use the icons in your Flutter widgets. Here’s a simple example of how to use an icon in a `Container` widget:

```dart
Container(
  child: Icon(
    FluentIcons.add_24_regular, // Use the desired icon from the package
    size: 50.0, // Set the size of the icon
    color: Colors.blue, // Set the color of the icon
  ),
)
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid compatibility issues:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile` to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Customizing Icons

You can customize the icons further by adjusting their size, color, and other properties. Here’s an example of a button with an icon:

```dart
ElevatedButton.icon(
  onPressed: () {},
  icon: Icon(FluentIcons.add_24_regular),
  label: Text('Add Item'),
  style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
    primary: Colors.green, // Button background color
  ),
)
```

With these steps, you can easily integrate and customize Fluent UI icons in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example: Using FluentUI System Icons in a Flutter App

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fluentui_system_icons/fluentui_system_icons.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Start the application with the RealFlutter widget
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Fluent UI Icons Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Fluent UI Icons Demo'), // Title of the app
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying an icon with a label
              Icon(
                FluentIcons.add_24_regular, // Fluent UI icon
                size: 100.0, // Size of the icon
                color: Colors.blue, // Color of the icon
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between icon and text
              Text(
                'Add Item', // Label for the icon
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24), // Text style
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between text and button
              ElevatedButton.icon(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Action to perform when button is pressed
                  print('Button Pressed!'); // Log to console
                },
                icon: Icon(FluentIcons.add_24_regular), // Icon in the button
                label: Text('Add Item'), // Label for the button
                style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
                  primary: Colors.green, // Button background color
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```
// Explanation of the application flow:

// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold, which provides the basic structure of the app.
// 4. The AppBar displays the title of the application.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Column widget.
// 6. Inside the Column, an Icon widget displays a Fluent UI icon with a specified size and color.
// 7. A Text widget below the icon provides a label for the icon.
// 8. An ElevatedButton is created with an icon and a label. When pressed, it logs a message to the console.
// 9. The application demonstrates how to use Fluent UI icons effectively in a Flutter app.
