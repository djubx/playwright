# Pigment Flutter Package: A Comprehensive Overview

The **Pigment** package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that allows for easy manipulation of colors in your applications. It provides a simple way to create and manage colors, making it particularly useful for applications that require dynamic theming or color adjustments based on user preferences or other conditions.

## When to Use Pigment
- **Dynamic Theming**: If your app requires changing themes based on user preferences or app states, Pigment can help manage these color changes seamlessly.
- **Color Manipulation**: When you need to adjust colors (like lightening or darkening) programmatically, Pigment provides straightforward methods to achieve this.
- **Custom Color Palettes**: For applications that utilize custom color palettes, Pigment allows you to define and manage these colors easily.

## Key Features
- **Color Manipulation**: Functions to lighten, darken, saturate, and desaturate colors.
- **Color Blending**: Ability to blend two colors together to create new shades.
- **Custom Color Definitions**: Define and manage a set of colors for your application.

With these features, Pigment is an excellent choice for developers looking to enhance their Flutter applications with advanced color management capabilities.

# Getting Started with Pigment

## Installation
To add the Pigment package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  pigment: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 9.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use Pigment in your Flutter application, you can import it as follows:

```dart
import 'package:pigment/pigment.dart';
```

You can then utilize its features to manipulate colors. For example:

```dart
Color myColor = Pigment.fromString("#FF5733"); // Create a color from a hex string
Color lighterColor = Pigment.darken(myColor, 0.2); // Darken the color by 20%
```

This basic setup allows you to start using Pigment in your Flutter applications effectively.

# Complete Example of Using Pigment

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pigment/pigment.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Pigment Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Pigment Color Manipulation'),
          backgroundColor: Pigment.fromString("#FF5733"), // Set app bar color using Pigment
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Display original color
              Container(
                width: 100,
                height: 100,
                color: Pigment.fromString("#FF5733"), // Original color
                child: Center(child: Text('Original')),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Display darkened color
              Container(
                width: 100,
                height: 100,
                color: Pigment.darken(Pigment.fromString("#FF5733"), 0.2), // Darkened color
                child: Center(child: Text('Darkened')),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Display lightened color
              Container(
                width: 100,
                height: 100,
                color: Pigment.lighten(Pigment.fromString("#FF5733"), 0.2), // Lightened color
                child: Center(child: Text('Lightened')),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. The AppBar's background color is set using Pigment.fromString to create a color from a hex string.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains a Column with three Containers.
// 6. Each Container displays a different color: the original, darkened, and lightened versions of the same base color.
// 7. The darkened and lightened colors are created using Pigment's darken and lighten methods, respectively.
// 8. The app visually demonstrates how Pigment can manipulate colors dynamically.
