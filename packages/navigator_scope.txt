Here's a detailed technical blog on the "navigator_scope" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Navigator Scope Flutter Package

The `navigator_scope` package is a powerful tool for managing navigation in Flutter applications. It provides a way to encapsulate navigation logic within a specific scope, allowing for more organized and maintainable code. This package is particularly useful in larger applications where managing multiple navigation stacks can become complex.

## When to Use `navigator_scope`

- **Complex Navigation Flows**: When your application has multiple navigation flows that need to be managed independently.
- **Scoped Navigation**: When you want to limit the scope of navigation to a specific part of your application, such as a feature module.
- **State Management**: When you need to manage the state of navigation in conjunction with other state management solutions like Provider or Riverpod.

## Features

- **Scoped Navigation**: Allows you to define navigation scopes that can be independently managed.
- **Easy Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing Flutter navigation patterns.
- **Customizable**: You can customize the navigation behavior to fit your application's needs.

By using `navigator_scope`, developers can create a more modular and maintainable navigation structure, making it easier to manage complex applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Navigator Scope

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `navigator_scope` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  navigator_scope: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions and configurations. Typically, no additional configurations are required for basic usage.

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your `Info.plist` file is configured correctly. Again, for basic usage, no additional configurations are usually necessary.

## Step 3: Basic Usage

To use the `navigator_scope` package, you need to wrap your application with the `NavigatorScope` widget. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:navigator_scope/navigator_scope.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: NavigatorScope(
        child: HomeScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate to the details screen
            Navigator.of(context).push(
              MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => DetailsScreen()),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Go to Details'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DetailsScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Details')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Details Screen')),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple app with a home screen and a details screen. The `NavigatorScope` widget wraps the home screen, allowing for scoped navigation.

# Complete Example of Navigator Scope

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:navigator_scope/navigator_scope.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Navigator Scope Example',
      home: NavigatorScope(
        child: HomeScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// HomeScreen widget
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate to the DetailsScreen when the button is pressed
            Navigator.of(context).push(
              MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => DetailsScreen()),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Go to Details'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// DetailsScreen widget
class DetailsScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Details')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Details Screen'),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Navigate back to the HomeScreen
                Navigator.of(context).pop();
              },
              child: Text('Back to Home'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
2. The NavigatorScope widget wraps the HomeScreen, allowing scoped navigation.
3. The HomeScreen displays a button that, when pressed, navigates to the DetailsScreen.
4. The DetailsScreen shows a message and a button to navigate back to the HomeScreen.
5. Pressing the back button on the DetailsScreen pops the current route off the stack, returning to the HomeScreen.
