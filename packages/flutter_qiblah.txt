# Complete Example of Using the Flutter Qiblah Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_qiblah/flutter_qiblah.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to hold the Qiblah direction
  double? qiblahDirection;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the Qiblah service
    _getQiblahDirection();
  }

  // Function to get the Qiblah direction
  void _getQiblahDirection() async {
    // Request location permission
    await FlutterQiblah.requestLocationPermission();
    // Get the Qiblah direction
    qiblahDirection = await FlutterQiblah.getQiblah();
    // Update the state to reflect the new direction
    setState(() {});
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Qiblah Direction'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: qiblahDirection != null
              ? Column(
                  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
                  children: [
                    Text(
                      'Qiblah Direction:',
                      style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
                    ),
                    // Display the Qiblah direction
                    Text(
                      '${qiblahDirection!.toStringAsFixed(2)}Â°',
                      style: TextStyle(fontSize: 48, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
                    ),
                  ],
                )
              : CircularProgressIndicator(), // Show loading indicator while fetching
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget, we define a stateful widget to manage the Qiblah direction state.
// 3. In the initState method, we call _getQiblahDirection to fetch the Qiblah direction when the widget is initialized.
// 4. The _getQiblahDirection function requests location permission and retrieves the Qiblah direction using the FlutterQiblah package.
// 5. Once the Qiblah direction is obtained, we update the state to reflect the new direction.
// 6. In the build method, we display the Qiblah direction or a loading indicator if the direction is still being fetched.
