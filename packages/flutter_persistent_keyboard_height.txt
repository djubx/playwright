# flutter_persistent_keyboard_height Package Overview

The `flutter_persistent_keyboard_height` package is a Flutter plugin designed to provide developers with a reliable way to manage the height of the keyboard across different platforms. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where the keyboard's height can affect the layout of the application, such as when using text fields or other input widgets.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `flutter_persistent_keyboard_height` package in the following scenarios:

- **Dynamic Layouts**: When your app has dynamic layouts that change based on the keyboard's visibility and height.
- **Custom Input Fields**: If you are implementing custom input fields that need to adjust their position based on the keyboard.
- **Responsive Design**: For applications that require a responsive design that adapts to the keyboard's height on both Android and iOS.

## Features

- **Persistent Keyboard Height**: The package provides a way to retrieve the current height of the keyboard, which can be used to adjust the UI accordingly.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup and usage, allowing developers to focus on building their applications without worrying about keyboard height issues.

By leveraging this package, developers can create a more user-friendly experience in their Flutter applications, ensuring that input fields are always visible and accessible, regardless of the keyboard's state.

# Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started with the `flutter_persistent_keyboard_height` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_persistent_keyboard_height: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_persistent_keyboard_height).

## Step 2: Install the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the appropriate settings. You may need to adjust the `windowSoftInputMode` to ensure that the keyboard does not obscure your input fields. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following line within the `<activity>` tag:

```xml
<activity
    android:name=".MainActivity"
    android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize">
```

### iOS

For iOS, you typically do not need to make any special configurations. However, ensure that your app's deployment target is set to a version that supports the package.

## Step 4: Using the Package

To use the `flutter_persistent_keyboard_height` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_persistent_keyboard_height/flutter_persistent_keyboard_height.dart';
```

You can then use the `KeyboardHeightProvider` to access the keyboard height in your widget tree. Wrap your main widget with `KeyboardHeightProvider` to make the keyboard height available throughout your app.

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return KeyboardHeightProvider(
    child: MaterialApp(
      home: YourHomePage(),
    ),
  );
}
```

Now, you can access the keyboard height in your widgets using the `KeyboardHeightProvider`:

```dart
double keyboardHeight = KeyboardHeightProvider.of(context).keyboardHeight;
```

This allows you to adjust your UI based on the keyboard's height dynamically.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_persistent_keyboard_height/flutter_persistent_keyboard_height.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Wrapping the MaterialApp with KeyboardHeightProvider
    return KeyboardHeightProvider(
      child: MaterialApp(
        title: 'Keyboard Height Example',
        home: RealFlutter(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Getting the keyboard height from the provider
    double keyboardHeight = KeyboardHeightProvider.of(context).keyboardHeight;

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Keyboard Height Example'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // A text field that adjusts its position based on the keyboard height
          Padding(
            padding: EdgeInsets.only(bottom: keyboardHeight),
            child: TextField(
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                border: OutlineInputBorder(),
                labelText: 'Enter text',
              ),
            ),
          ),
          // A button that can be used to submit the text
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Action to perform on button press
            },
            child: Text('Submit'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that wraps the MaterialApp with KeyboardHeightProvider.
// 3. Inside RealFlutter, we retrieve the current keyboard height using KeyboardHeightProvider.of(context).keyboardHeight.
// 4. The TextField is wrapped in a Padding widget that uses the keyboard height to adjust its bottom padding.
// 5. When the keyboard appears, the TextField moves up, ensuring it remains visible to the user.
// 6. An ElevatedButton is provided for submitting the text, demonstrating how to integrate input fields with keyboard height management.
```
