# Tutorial

## Setup Process

To get started with the `scan` package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add Dependency
Add the `scan` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  scan: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

### Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version required
    }
}
```

2. Add camera permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera"/>
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera.autofocus"/>
```

#### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request camera access:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the camera to scan barcodes.</string>
```

### Step 3: Import the Package
In your Dart file, import the `scan` package:

```dart
import 'package:scan/scan.dart';
```

## Using the Package

### Basic Usage
To implement a simple barcode scanner, you can use the `ScanView` widget provided by the package. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:scan/scan.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Barcode Scanner')),
        body: ScanView(
          onCapture: (String data) {
            // Handle the scanned data
            print('Scanned data: $data');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `ScanView` widget captures the scanned data and prints it to the console. You can replace the `print` statement with any action you want to perform with the scanned data.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:scan/scan.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Barcode Scanner')),
        body: ScanView(
          onCapture: (String data) {
            // Handle the scanned data
            print('Scanned data: $data');
            // Show a dialog with the scanned data
            showDialog(
              context: context,
              builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                title: Text('Scanned Data'),
                content: Text(data),
                actions: [
                  TextButton(
                    onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                    child: Text('OK'),
                  ),
                ],
              ),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which builds a MaterialApp.
// 2. The home of the app is a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a body.
// 3. The body consists of a ScanView widget that handles the scanning process.
// 4. When a barcode or QR code is scanned, the onCapture callback is triggered.
// 5. The scanned data is printed to the console and displayed in an AlertDialog.
// 6. The user can dismiss the dialog by pressing the 'OK' button.
```
