```yml
dependencies:
  dynamic_background: ^1.0.0
```
### Step 2: Import the Package in Your Dart File

```
### Step 3: Create a Dynamic Background Widget

)
```
### Platform-Specific Details

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

### Optimizations

To optimize the performance of the dynamic background, you can use the following techniques:

* Use a cached image or video to reduce the load time.
* Use a placeholder image or video to display while the dynamic background is loading.
* Use a fade-in animation to smoothly transition between different backgrounds.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dynamic_background/dynamic_background.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dynamic Background Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  // Step 1: Create a dynamic background widget
  DynamicBackground _dynamicBackground;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Step 2: Initialize the dynamic background widget
    _dynamicBackground = DynamicBackground(
      backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
      backgroundImage: AssetImage('assets/background_image.jpg'),
      backgroundVideo: File('assets/background_video.mp4'),
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Dynamic Background Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: _dynamicBackground,
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application flow:
// 1. The app starts and the `MyApp` widget is created.
// 2. The `MyApp` widget builds the `MyHomePage` widget.
// 3. The `MyHomePage` widget creates a `DynamicBackground` widget and initializes it with a blue background color, a background image, and a background video.
// 4. The `DynamicBackground` widget is displayed in the center of the screen.
// 5. The dynamic background changes based on the time of day or the user's location.
```

// Final summary:
// The code creates a Flutter app with a dynamic background that changes based on the time of day or the user's location.
// The app uses the `dynamic_background` package to create a dynamic background widget.
// The dynamic background widget is displayed in the center of the screen and changes smoothly using a fade-in animation.
