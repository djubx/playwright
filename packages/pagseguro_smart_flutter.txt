# Tutorial

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `pagseguro_smart_flutter` package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `pagseguro_smart_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  pagseguro_smart_flutter: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Configure for Android

For Android, you need to ensure that your app has the necessary permissions and configurations:

1. Open `AndroidManifest.xml` located in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

3. Ensure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Configure for iOS

For iOS, you need to make some additional configurations:

1. Open `Info.plist` located in `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following entries to allow network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Initialize the Package

In your main Dart file, import the package and initialize it:

```dart
import 'package:pagseguro_smart_flutter/pagseguro_smart_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
  PagSeguroSmart.init('YOUR_PAGSEGURO_TOKEN'); // Replace with your PagSeguro token
}
```

## Step 5: Using the Package

You can now use the package to create payment requests. Here’s a simple example of how to initiate a payment:

```dart
void initiatePayment() async {
  final response = await PagSeguroSmart.startPayment(
    amount: 100.00, // Amount in BRL
    currency: 'BRL',
    description: 'Payment for Order #12345',
  );

  if (response.success) {
    // Handle successful payment
  } else {
    // Handle payment failure
  }
}
```

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the `pagseguro_smart_flutter` package in your Flutter application effectively.

# Complete Example

Here’s a complete example of a Flutter application that demonstrates the key features of the `pagseguro_smart_flutter` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pagseguro_smart_flutter/pagseguro_smart_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
  PagSeguroSmart.init('YOUR_PAGSEGURO_TOKEN'); // Initialize with your PagSeguro token
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'PagSeguro Payment Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: PaymentScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PaymentScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('PagSeguro Payment'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            initiatePayment();
          },
          child: Text('Pay Now'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void initiatePayment() async {
    // Start the payment process
    final response = await PagSeguroSmart.startPayment(
      amount: 100.00, // Amount in BRL
      currency: 'BRL',
      description: 'Payment for Order #12345',
    );

    // Check the response from the payment process
    if (response.success) {
      // Payment was successful
      print('Payment successful: ${response.transactionId}');
      // You can navigate to a success screen or show a success message
    } else {
      // Payment failed
      print('Payment failed: ${response.errorMessage}');
      // You can show an error message to the user
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and initializes the PagSeguro package with a token.
// 2. The main screen displays a button labeled "Pay Now."
// 3. When the button is pressed, the initiatePayment function is called.
// 4. The initiatePayment function calls PagSeguroSmart.startPayment with the payment details.
// 5. The response is checked for success or failure, and appropriate actions are taken.
// 6. If successful, the transaction ID is printed, and you can navigate to a success screen.
// 7. If failed, the error message is printed, and you can inform the user of the failure.
```
