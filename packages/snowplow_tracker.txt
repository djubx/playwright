# Tutorial: Setting Up the Snowplow Tracker Flutter Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **snowplow_tracker** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the **snowplow_tracker** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  snowplow_tracker: ^<latest_version>
```

Make sure to replace `<latest_version>` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/snowplow_tracker).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add the necessary permissions in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. Ensure that your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

## Step 3: Initialize the Tracker

In your main Dart file, import the package and initialize the tracker:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:snowplow_tracker/snowplow_tracker.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the Snowplow Tracker
  SnowplowTracker tracker = SnowplowTracker(
    namespace: 'my_app',
    appId: 'my_app_id',
    endpoint: 'https://your-collector-endpoint.com',
  );

  runApp(MyApp(tracker: tracker));
}
```

## Step 4: Using the Tracker

You can now use the tracker to log events. For example, to track a screen view:

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  final SnowplowTracker tracker;

  MyApp({required this.tracker});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: HomeScreen(tracker: tracker),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final SnowplowTracker tracker;

  HomeScreen({required this.tracker});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Track screen view
    tracker.trackScreenView('Home Screen');

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Track button click
            tracker.trackSelfDescribingEvent(
              SelfDescribingEvent(
                schema: 'iglu:com.example/button_click/jsonschema/1-0-0',
                data: {'button_name': 'Click Me'},
              ),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Click Me'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize the Snowplow Tracker and use it to track a screen view and a button click event.

# Complete Example: Snowplow Tracker in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:snowplow_tracker/snowplow_tracker.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the Snowplow Tracker
  SnowplowTracker tracker = SnowplowTracker(
    namespace: 'my_app',
    appId: 'my_app_id',
    endpoint: 'https://your-collector-endpoint.com',
  );

  runApp(MyApp(tracker: tracker));
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  final SnowplowTracker tracker;

  MyApp({required this.tracker});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: HomeScreen(tracker: tracker),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final SnowplowTracker tracker;

  HomeScreen({required this.tracker});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Track screen view
    tracker.trackScreenView('Home Screen');

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Track button click
            tracker.trackSelfDescribingEvent(
              SelfDescribingEvent(
                schema: 'iglu:com.example/button_click/jsonschema/1-0-0',
                data: {'button_name': 'Click Me'},
              ),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Click Me'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Snowplow Tracker with the necessary parameters.
// 2. The MyApp widget is created, passing the tracker instance to it.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is displayed, where a screen view event is tracked.
// 4. When the button is clicked, a self-describing event is sent to the Snowplow collector with the button's name.
// 5. This allows for detailed tracking of user interactions within the app.
```
