# Setting Up the Drop Zone Package
To use the `drop_zone` package, follow these steps:

1.  Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

    ```yml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  drop_zone: ^1.0.0
```

2.  Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.
3.  Import the package in your Dart file:

    ```dart
import 'package:drop_zone/drop_zone.dart';
```

## Platform-Specific Details
The `drop_zone` package works on both Android and iOS platforms. However, there are some platform-specific details to consider:

*   Android: The package uses the `android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission to write files to the device's external storage. You must add this permission to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

    ```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```

*   iOS: The package uses the `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` key in the `Info.plist` file to access the device's photo library. You must add this key to your `Info.plist` file:

    ```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs access to your photo library to upload files.</string>
```
