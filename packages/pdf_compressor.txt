Here's a detailed technical blog on the "pdf_compressor" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# PDF Compressor Flutter Package

The `pdf_compressor` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to help developers compress PDF files efficiently within their Flutter applications. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where file size reduction is crucial, such as when uploading documents to a server, sharing files via email, or optimizing storage on mobile devices.

## When to Use This Package

- **File Uploads**: When users need to upload large PDF files, compressing them can significantly reduce upload times and save bandwidth.
- **Email Attachments**: Compressing PDFs before sending them as email attachments can help avoid size limits imposed by email providers.
- **Storage Optimization**: For applications that manage a large number of PDF files, compression can help save storage space on devices.

## Features

- **Easy Integration**: The package is straightforward to integrate into any Flutter project.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Customizable Compression**: Allows developers to specify the level of compression based on their needs.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Utilizes asynchronous methods to ensure smooth user experiences without blocking the UI.

With these features, the `pdf_compressor` package stands out as a valuable asset for Flutter developers looking to manage PDF files effectively.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the PDF Compressor Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `pdf_compressor` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  pdf_compressor: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file to allow file access. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to select PDF files.</string>
<key>NSDocumentsFolderUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your documents to select PDF files.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to compress a PDF file.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pdf_compressor/pdf_compressor.dart';
import 'dart:io';
import 'package:path_provider/path_provider.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'PDF Compressor Example',
      home: PDFCompressorHome(),
    );
  }
}

class PDFCompressorHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PDFCompressorHomeState createState() => _PDFCompressorHomeState();
}

class _PDFCompressorHomeState extends State<PDFCompressorHome> {
  String _compressedFilePath = '';

  // Function to compress the PDF file
  Future<void> _compressPDF() async {
    // Get the directory to store the compressed file
    Directory tempDir = await getTemporaryDirectory();
    String tempPath = tempDir.path;

    // Specify the path of the original PDF file
    String originalFilePath = 'path/to/your/original.pdf'; // Update this path

    // Compress the PDF file
    String compressedFilePath = await PdfCompressor.compress(
      originalFilePath,
      outputPath: '$tempPath/compressed.pdf',
      quality: 80, // Set the quality of compression (0-100)
    );

    // Update the state with the compressed file path
    setState(() {
      _compressedFilePath = compressedFilePath;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('PDF Compressor'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _compressPDF,
              child: Text('Compress PDF'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(
              _compressedFilePath.isNotEmpty
                  ? 'Compressed File: $_compressedFilePath'
                  : 'No file compressed yet.',
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget (PDFCompressorHome).
// 3. PDFCompressorHome is a stateful widget that manages the state of the compressed file path.
// 4. The _compressPDF function is triggered when the user presses the "Compress PDF" button.
// 5. Inside _compressPDF, the app retrieves the temporary directory to store the compressed file.
// 6. The original PDF file path is specified (this should be updated to a valid path).
// 7. The PdfCompressor.compress method is called to compress the PDF, specifying the output path and quality.
// 8. Once the compression is complete, the state is updated with the path of the compressed file.
// 9. The UI displays the path of the compressed file or a message indicating no file has been compressed yet.
```
