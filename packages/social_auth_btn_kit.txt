# Tutorial: Setting Up the Social Auth Button Kit

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **social_auth_btn_kit** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the **social_auth_btn_kit** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  social_auth_btn_kit: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following configurations:

```xml

# Complete Example: Implementing Social Auth Buttons

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:social_auth_btn_kit/social_auth_btn_kit.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Social Auth Button Kit Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: AuthScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class AuthScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Social Auth Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Google Sign-In Button
            SocialAuthButton(
              text: 'Sign in with Google',
              buttonType: ButtonType.google,
              onPressed: () {
                // Handle Google Sign-In
                print('Google Sign-In pressed');
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Facebook Sign-In Button
            SocialAuthButton(
              text: 'Sign in with Facebook',
              buttonType: ButtonType.facebook,
              onPressed: () {
                // Handle Facebook Sign-In
                print('Facebook Sign-In pressed');
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Twitter Sign-In Button
            SocialAuthButton(
              text: 'Sign in with Twitter',
              buttonType: ButtonType.twitter,
              onPressed: () {
                // Handle Twitter Sign-In
                print('Twitter Sign-In pressed');
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of the MaterialApp is set to AuthScreen, which contains the UI for social authentication.
// 4. In the AuthScreen widget, we create a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget to align the buttons.
// 5. We create three SocialAuthButton widgets for Google, Facebook, and Twitter.
// 6. Each button has an onPressed callback that currently prints a message to the console when pressed.
// 7. The buttons are spaced out using SizedBox for better visual separation.
```

// Final Summary:
// The application starts with the main function, which initializes the Flutter app. The RealFlutter widget sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home screen as AuthScreen. The AuthScreen contains three social authentication buttons for Google, Facebook, and Twitter. Each button has an onPressed callback that currently prints a message to the console, which can be replaced with actual authentication logic. The layout is centered and spaced for a clean user interface.
