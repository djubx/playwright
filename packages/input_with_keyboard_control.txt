# Overview of the `input_with_keyboard_control` Flutter Package

The `input_with_keyboard_control` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to enhance user input experiences by providing advanced keyboard control features. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where precise control over the keyboard's behavior is required, such as in form-heavy applications or apps that require custom input handling.

## Key Features

- **Custom Keyboard Actions**: Define custom actions for keyboard events, allowing for a more tailored user experience.
- **Focus Management**: Easily manage focus between different input fields, improving navigation and usability.
- **Platform-Specific Customization**: Offers platform-specific configurations to optimize keyboard behavior on both Android and iOS.

## When to Use

- **Form Applications**: Ideal for applications with complex forms where default keyboard behavior might not suffice.
- **Custom Input Handling**: When you need to implement custom input logic that goes beyond the standard Flutter input widgets.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: To provide a more intuitive and seamless input experience, especially on mobile devices.

# Setting Up and Using the `input_with_keyboard_control` Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `input_with_keyboard_control` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter applications.

## Installation

To get started, add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  input_with_keyboard_control: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Basic Setup

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` is configured to handle keyboard input correctly. Typically, no additional configuration is needed, but you can customize the input mode if necessary:

```xml
<activity
  android:name=".MainActivity"
  android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize">
</activity>
```

### iOS Configuration

On iOS, ensure that your app's `Info.plist` is set up to support keyboard input. Again, no specific configuration is usually required, but you can adjust settings as needed for your app's requirements.

## Using the Package

To use the package, import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:input_with_keyboard_control/input_with_keyboard_control.dart';
```

### Implementing Keyboard Control

Create a widget that uses the `RealFlutter` class to manage input fields with enhanced keyboard control:

```dart
class MyInputWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return RealFlutter(
      child: Column(
        children: [
          TextField(
            decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'First Name'),
          ),
          TextField(
            decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Last Name'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, `RealFlutter` is used to wrap input fields, providing enhanced keyboard control and focus management.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:input_with_keyboard_control/input_with_keyboard_control.dart';

void main() => runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Keyboard Control Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Keyboard Control Example'),
        ),
        body: MyInputForm(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MyInputForm extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyInputFormState createState() => _MyInputFormState();
}

class _MyInputFormState extends State<MyInputForm> {
  final FocusNode _firstNameFocus = FocusNode();
  final FocusNode _lastNameFocus = FocusNode();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return RealFlutter(
      child: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              focusNode: _firstNameFocus,
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'First Name'),
              onSubmitted: (value) {
                // Move focus to the last name field when done
                _lastNameFocus.requestFocus();
              },
            ),
            TextField(
              focusNode: _lastNameFocus,
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Last Name'),
              onSubmitted: (value) {
                // Close the keyboard when done
                _lastNameFocus.unfocus();
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Clean up the focus nodes when the form is disposed
    _firstNameFocus.dispose();
    _lastNameFocus.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }
}

// Application Flow:
// 1. The app starts with the `MyApp` widget, which sets up a basic Material app with a home screen.
// 2. The home screen contains an AppBar and a body that hosts the `MyInputForm` widget.
// 3. `MyInputForm` is a stateful widget that manages two text fields for first and last names.
// 4. Each text field is associated with a `FocusNode` to control focus programmatically.
// 5. When the user submits the first name, focus shifts to the last name field.
// 6. Submitting the last name field unfocuses the keyboard, providing a seamless input experience.
// 7. Focus nodes are disposed of properly to prevent memory leaks.
