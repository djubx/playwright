# Overview of the `page_route_animator` Flutter Package

The `page_route_animator` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to enhance their application's navigation experience with smooth and customizable page transitions. This package allows developers to create animated page routes that can significantly improve the user experience by providing visual feedback during navigation.

## When to Use `page_route_animator`

You should consider using the `page_route_animator` package in scenarios such as:

- **Custom Transitions**: When you want to implement unique page transitions that are not available in the default Flutter navigation.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: To provide a more engaging and visually appealing navigation experience for users.
- **Complex Navigation Flows**: In applications with multiple nested routes where standard transitions may not suffice.

## Features

- **Customizable Animations**: Offers a variety of built-in animations and the ability to create your own.
- **Ease of Use**: Simple API that integrates seamlessly with Flutter's navigation system.
- **Support for Multiple Platforms**: Works on both Android and iOS, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.

With these features, `page_route_animator` is an excellent choice for developers looking to elevate their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `page_route_animator`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `page_route_animator` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  page_route_animator: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart files where you want to use the package, import it as follows:

```dart
import 'package:page_route_animator/page_route_animator.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

### Basic Usage

To use the `page_route_animator`, you can replace the standard `Navigator.push` method with `PageRouteAnimator`. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
Navigator.push(
  context,
  PageRouteAnimator(
    page: SecondPage(), // The page you want to navigate to
    animationType: AnimationType.slideInFromRight, // Choose your animation type
  ),
);
```

### Platform-Specific Details

- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid any compatibility issues.
  
  ```groovy
  android {
      ...
      defaultConfig {
          ...
          minSdkVersion 21
      }
  }
  ```

- **iOS**: No specific configurations are required, but ensure that your deployment target is set appropriately in `ios/Podfile`.

## Step 4: Customizing Animations

You can customize the animations by creating your own animation types. For example:

```dart
class CustomAnimation extends PageRouteAnimator {
  CustomAnimation({required Widget page}) : super(page: page);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return FadeTransition(
      opacity: animation,
      child: SlideTransition(
        position: Tween<Offset>(
          begin: Offset(1.0, 0.0), // Start from the right
          end: Offset.zero, // End at the original position
        ).animate(animation),
        child: page,
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This allows you to create a unique transition that fits your application's theme.

# Complete Example of Using `page_route_animator`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:page_route_animator/page_route_animator.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Page Route Animator Example',
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Page'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate to the SecondPage with a slide-in animation
            Navigator.push(
              context,
              PageRouteAnimator(
                page: SecondPage(),
                animationType: AnimationType.slideInFromRight,
              ),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Go to Second Page'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SecondPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Second Page'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate back to the HomePage
            Navigator.pop(context);
          },
          child: Text('Back to Home Page'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` widget.
// 2. `RealFlutter` builds a MaterialApp with `HomePage` as the home screen.
// 3. In `HomePage`, there is a button that, when pressed, triggers navigation to `SecondPage`.
// 4. The navigation uses `PageRouteAnimator` to create a slide-in animation from the right.
// 5. `SecondPage` has a button to navigate back to `HomePage`, which uses the default pop behavior.
// 6. The user can navigate back and forth between the two pages with smooth animations.
