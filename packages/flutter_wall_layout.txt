<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Flutter Wall Layout Package

The `flutter_wall_layout` package is a powerful layout tool for Flutter that allows developers to create complex, responsive layouts with ease. It is particularly useful for applications that require a grid-like structure, where items can be arranged in a wall-like fashion, similar to Pinterest or Instagram feeds. This package provides a flexible way to manage the positioning and sizing of widgets, making it ideal for photo galleries, product listings, and any application that benefits from a dynamic layout.

## When to Use `flutter_wall_layout`

- **Dynamic Content**: When your application displays a varying number of items that need to be arranged in a visually appealing manner.
- **Responsive Design**: If you want your layout to adapt to different screen sizes and orientations seamlessly.
- **Grid-like Structures**: For applications that require a grid layout but with more flexibility than a standard grid view.

## Features

- **Customizable Item Sizes**: Control the size of each item in the layout.
- **Responsive Layout**: Automatically adjusts the layout based on screen size and orientation.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate into existing Flutter applications.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Built with performance in mind, ensuring smooth scrolling and rendering.

In summary, the `flutter_wall_layout` package is an excellent choice for developers looking to implement a flexible and responsive layout in their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `flutter_wall_layout`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `flutter_wall_layout` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_wall_layout: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_wall_layout).

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `flutter_wall_layout` in your app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_wall_layout/flutter_wall_layout.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Wall Layout Example')),
        body: WallLayout(
          children: List.generate(20, (index) {
            return Container(
              margin: EdgeInsets.all(4.0),
              color: Colors.blue[(index % 9 + 1) * 100],
              height: (index % 5 + 1) * 50.0, // Varying heights
              child: Center(child: Text('Item $index')),
            );
          }),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple wall layout with 20 items, each having a varying height and a different shade of blue.

# Complete Example of `flutter_wall_layout`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_wall_layout/flutter_wall_layout.dart';

// Main class of the application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Wall Layout Example')),
        body: WallLayout(
          // Generating a list of 20 items for the wall layout
          children: List.generate(20, (index) {
            return Container(
              margin: EdgeInsets.all(4.0), // Margin around each item
              color: Colors.blue[(index % 9 + 1) * 100], // Color based on index
              height: (index % 5 + 1) * 50.0, // Varying heights for items
              child: Center(child: Text('Item $index')), // Centered text
            );
          }),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp().
// 2. The RealFlutter class is instantiated, which builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold widget is created with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body contains a WallLayout widget, which arranges its children in a wall-like structure.
// 5. A list of 20 items is generated using List.generate(), where each item is a Container.
// 6. Each Container has a margin, a background color based on its index, and a varying height.
// 7. The text 'Item X' is centered within each Container, where X is the item's index.
// 8. The layout is responsive and adapts to the screen size, providing a visually appealing arrangement of items.
