# Overview of the package_by_walle Flutter Package

The `package_by_walle` is a Flutter package designed to facilitate the management of app packages, particularly in scenarios where you need to handle multiple versions of an application. This package is particularly useful for developers who are working on applications that require different configurations or features based on the environment (e.g., development, staging, production).

## When to Use This Package
- **Multiple Build Variants**: If your application has different build variants that need to be managed separately.
- **Feature Flags**: When you want to enable or disable features based on the app version or environment.
- **Version Management**: To handle different versions of your app seamlessly.

## Key Features
- **Easy Package Management**: Simplifies the process of managing different app packages.
- **Environment Configuration**: Allows for easy switching between different configurations.
- **Version Control**: Helps in maintaining and deploying different versions of the app.

2. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions and configurations set in your `Info.plist`.

## Basic Usage
Once you have installed the package and configured your project, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initialize and use the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:package_by_walle/package_by_walle.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Package by Walle Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Walle Package Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Initialize the package
              PackageByWalle.initialize();
              // Fetch the current package version
              String version = PackageByWalle.getCurrentVersion();
              // Display the version
              showDialog(
                context: context,
                builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                  title: Text('Current Version'),
                  content: Text(version),
                  actions: [
                    TextButton(
                      onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                      child: Text('OK'),
                    ),
                  ],
                ),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Get Current Version'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of package_by_walle

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:package_by_walle/package_by_walle.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Package by Walle Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Walle Package Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Initialize the package
              PackageByWalle.initialize();
              // Fetch the current package version
              String version = PackageByWalle.getCurrentVersion();
              // Display the version in a dialog
              showDialog(
                context: context,
                builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                  title: Text('Current Version'),
                  content: Text(version),
                  actions: [
                    TextButton(
                      onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                      child: Text('OK'),
                    ),
                  ],
                ),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Get Current Version'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'Walle Package Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 5. An ElevatedButton is created, which, when pressed, initializes the package and fetches the current version.
// 6. The current version is displayed in an AlertDialog, allowing the user to see the version and dismiss the dialog.
// 7. The app is simple yet demonstrates the core functionality of the package_by_walle package.
