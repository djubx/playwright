# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using at_contacts_flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `at_contacts_flutter` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `at_contacts_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  at_contacts_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/at_contacts_flutter).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_CONTACTS"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_CONTACTS"/>
```

2. Ensure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request permission to access contacts:

```xml
<key>NSContactsUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your contacts.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in our Flutter application.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:at_contacts_flutter/at_contacts_flutter.dart';
```

2. Initialize the contact manager and request permissions:

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await AtContactsFlutter.requestPermission();
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

3. Use the package to fetch contacts, add new contacts, or update existing ones as needed.

This setup will allow you to effectively manage contacts within your Flutter application using the `at_contacts_flutter` package.

# Complete Example of at_contacts_flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:at_contacts_flutter/at_contacts_flutter.dart';

void main() async {
  // Ensure that widget binding is initialized before running the app
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  
  // Request permission to access contacts
  await AtContactsFlutter.requestPermission();
  
  // Run the main application
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Contacts Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: ContactsPage(),
    );
  }
}

class ContactsPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ContactsPageState createState() => _ContactsPageState();
}

class _ContactsPageState extends State<ContactsPage> {
  List<Contact> _contacts = []; // List to hold contacts

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _fetchContacts(); // Fetch contacts when the page initializes
  }

  // Function to fetch contacts
  void _fetchContacts() async {
    // Retrieve contacts using the at_contacts_flutter package
    List<Contact> contacts = await AtContactsFlutter.getContacts();
    setState(() {
      _contacts = contacts; // Update the state with fetched contacts
    });
  }

  // Function to add a new contact
  void _addContact() async {
    // Create a new contact object
    Contact newContact = Contact(
      displayName: 'New Contact',
      phoneNumber: '1234567890',
    );
    
    // Add the new contact using the package
    await AtContactsFlutter.addContact(newContact);
    _fetchContacts(); // Refresh the contact list
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Contacts'),
        actions: [
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.add),
            onPressed: _addContact, // Add contact button
          ),
        ],
      ),
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: _contacts.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          // Display each contact in the list
          return ListTile(
            title: Text(_contacts[index].displayName ?? 'No Name'),
            subtitle: Text(_contacts[index].phoneNumber ?? 'No Number'),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts by initializing the Flutter engine and requesting permission to access contacts.
// 2. The main widget, RealFlutter, sets up the MaterialApp and directs to the ContactsPage.
// 3. In ContactsPage, the _fetchContacts method is called during initialization to load existing contacts.
// 4. The contacts are displayed in a ListView, and users can add a new contact by pressing the add button.
// 5. When a new contact is added, the contact list is refreshed to show the updated list.
```

// The application flow is as follows:
