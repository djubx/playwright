# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Bot Toast

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **bot_toast** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  bot_toast: ^x.x.x  # Replace x.x.x with the latest version
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Basic Setup

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` file if you plan to use any specific features that require permissions. However, for basic toast functionality, no additional configuration is necessary.

## Step 3: Using Bot Toast

To use the **bot_toast** package, you need to initialize it in your main application file. Here’s how to do it:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:bot_toast/bot_toast.dart';
```

2. Initialize the BotToast widget in your `main` function:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

3. Wrap your application with the `BotToastInit` widget:

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      builder: BotToastInit(), // Wrap your app with BotToastInit
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}
```

4. Now, you can show a toast notification anywhere in your app:

```dart
BotToast.showText(text: "Hello, Bot Toast!");
```

## Step 4: Customizing Toasts

You can customize the appearance and behavior of your toasts. Here’s an example of a success toast:

```dart
BotToast.showText(
  text: "Operation Successful!",
  duration: Duration(seconds: 2),
  backgroundColor: Colors.green,
  textStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
);
```

This will display a green toast with white text for 2 seconds.

## Conclusion

The **bot_toast** package is easy to set up and provides a wide range of customization options for toast notifications in Flutter applications. By following the steps outlined above, you can enhance your app's user experience with informative and visually appealing toasts.

# Complete Example of Bot Toast in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bot_toast/bot_toast.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      builder: BotToastInit(), // Initialize BotToast
      home: HomeScreen(),
      navigatorObservers: [BotToastNavigatorObserver()], // Observer for navigation
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Bot Toast Example")),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Show a success toast when the button is pressed
            BotToast.showText(
              text: "Button Pressed!",
              duration: Duration(seconds: 2),
              backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
              textStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
            );
          },
          child: Text("Show Toast"),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
