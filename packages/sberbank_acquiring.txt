                onSuccess: (response) {
                  // This callback is triggered on successful payment
                  print('Payment Successful: $response');
                  // You can navigate to a success page or show a success message
                },
                onError: (error) {
                  // This callback is triggered on payment error
                  print('Payment Error: $error');
                  // You can show an error message to the user
                },
              );
            },
            child: Text('Pay Now'), // Button text
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and displays a button labeled "Pay Now".
// 2. When the user taps the button, the `startPayment` method is called.
// 3. The payment amount and order ID are specified.
// 4. If the payment is successful, the `onSuccess` callback is executed, and the response is printed.
// 5. If there is an error during the payment process, the `onError` callback is executed, and the error is printed.
// 6. You can customize the success and error handling as needed, such as navigating to different screens or displaying messages.
