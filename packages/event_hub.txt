# Event Hub Flutter Package

The **event_hub** Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to facilitate event-driven programming in Flutter applications. It allows developers to create a centralized event bus that can be used to communicate between different parts of an application without tightly coupling components. This is particularly useful in large applications where multiple widgets or services need to respond to the same events.

## When to Use

You should consider using the **event_hub** package in scenarios such as:

- **Decoupled Communication**: When you want to enable communication between widgets that are not directly related in the widget tree.
- **Global State Management**: For managing application-wide events, such as user authentication status changes or theme updates.
- **Complex Applications**: In applications with multiple screens and complex navigation, where events need to be propagated across different parts of the app.

## Features

- **Event Broadcasting**: Easily broadcast events to multiple listeners.
- **Event Filtering**: Listen for specific events based on criteria.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead, making it suitable for performance-sensitive applications.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that integrates seamlessly with existing Flutter applications.

Overall, the **event_hub** package enhances the modularity and maintainability of Flutter applications by promoting a clean separation of concerns.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Event Hub

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **event_hub** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **event_hub** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  event_hub: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # Ensure this is set to at least 10.0
```

## Step 3: Using the Event Hub

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in our application.

1. **Create an Event Hub Instance**: Initialize the event hub in your main application file.
2. **Define Events**: Create event classes that represent the events you want to handle.
3. **Listen for Events**: Use the event hub to listen for specific events in your widgets.
4. **Broadcast Events**: Trigger events from anywhere in your application.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement this:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:event_hub/event_hub.dart';

class RealFlutterApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Event Hub Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Broadcasting an event
            EventHub().broadcast('buttonPressed', 'Hello from HomeScreen!');
          },
          child: Text('Press Me'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app with a button that broadcasts an event when pressed. The event can be listened to by any other part of the application.

## Conclusion

The **event_hub** package provides a straightforward way to implement event-driven architecture in Flutter applications. By following the steps outlined above, you can easily set up and start using the package in your projects.

# Complete Example of Event Hub in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:event_hub/event_hub.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutterApp());
}

class RealFlutterApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Listen for events
    EventHub().on('buttonPressed', (data) {
      // Show a snackbar when the event is received
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text(data)),
      );
    });

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Event Hub Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Broadcasting an event
            EventHub().broadcast('buttonPressed', 'Hello from HomeScreen!');
          },
          child: Text('Press Me'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutterApp.
// 2. RealFlutterApp builds the MaterialApp and sets HomeScreen as the home widget.
// 3. In HomeScreen, we listen for the 'buttonPressed' event using EventHub().on().
// 4. When the button is pressed, the event is broadcasted with EventHub().broadcast().
// 5. The event listener receives the event and shows a Snackbar with the event data.
// 6. This demonstrates how to decouple the button press action from the response, allowing for a clean and maintainable code structure.
