# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Horizontal List View Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `horizontal_list_view` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  horizontal_list_view: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Horizontal List View

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a horizontal list view.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:horizontal_list_view/horizontal_list_view.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Horizontal List View Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: HorizontalListView(
            itemCount: 10, // Number of items in the list
            itemBuilder: (context, index) {
              return Container(
                width: 100, // Width of each item
                height: 100, // Height of each item
                color: Colors.blue,
                child: Center(
                  child: Text(
                    'Item $index',
                    style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
                  ),
                ),
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple horizontal list view that displays 10 items. Each item is a blue square with the text "Item X" in the center.

# Complete Example of Horizontal List View

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:horizontal_list_view/horizontal_list_view.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Horizontal List View Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          // Centering the Horizontal List View in the body
          child: HorizontalListView(
            itemCount: 10, // Total number of items to display
            itemBuilder: (context, index) {
              // Building each item in the list
              return Container(
                width: 100, // Width of each item
                height: 100, // Height of each item
                color: Colors.blue, // Background color of the item
                child: Center(
                  // Centering the text within the item
                  child: Text(
                    'Item $index', // Displaying the item index
                    style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white), // Text color
                  ),
                ),
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the RealFlutter app
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Horizontal List View Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers a HorizontalListView widget.
// 5. The HorizontalListView is configured to display 10 items, each represented by a blue container.
// 6. Each container has a fixed width and height, and displays its index in white text at the center.
// 7. The user can scroll horizontally to view all items in the list.
