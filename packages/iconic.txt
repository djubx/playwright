# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Iconic

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the Iconic package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  iconic: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        vectorDrawables.useSupportLibrary = true
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable the use of vector images. Open your `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode, and ensure that the following settings are enabled:

- Go to the project settings.
- Under the "Build Settings" tab, search for "Enable Bitcode" and set it to `NO`.

## Step 4: Using Iconic in Your Flutter App

Now that you have set up the Iconic package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the Iconic package to display custom icons.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:iconic/iconic.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Iconic Flutter Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Iconic(
            icon: 'icon-name', // Replace with your icon name
            size: 100.0,
            color: Colors.blue,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, replace `'icon-name'` with the actual name of the icon you want to use from your icon set.

# Complete Example of Using Iconic

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:iconic/iconic.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Iconic Flutter Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Iconic Flutter Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying a custom icon using Iconic
              Iconic(
                icon: 'icon-name', // Replace with your icon name
                size: 100.0, // Size of the icon
                color: Colors.blue, // Color of the icon
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              Text(
                'This is a custom icon from Iconic!',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with RealFlutter as the root widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the Iconic widget and a Text widget vertically.
// 5. The Iconic widget displays a custom icon, which you can replace with your desired icon name.
// 6. The Text widget provides a description below the icon, enhancing the user interface.
```
