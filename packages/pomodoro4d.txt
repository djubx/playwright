# Overview of the pomodoro4d Flutter Package

The `pomodoro4d` package is a Flutter library designed to implement the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method that encourages users to work in focused intervals followed by short breaks. This package is particularly useful for developers looking to integrate productivity features into their applications, whether for personal use or as part of a larger productivity tool.

## When to Use This Package
- **Task Management Apps**: If you're building an app that helps users manage tasks and time, the Pomodoro Technique can enhance productivity.
- **Focus Tools**: For applications aimed at improving focus and reducing distractions, this package provides a structured approach to time management.
- **Educational Apps**: It can be beneficial in educational settings where students need to manage study time effectively.

## Key Features
- **Customizable Timer**: Users can set their own work and break intervals.
- **Notifications**: Alerts users when it's time to take a break or resume work.
- **Simple API**: Easy to integrate and use within any Flutter application.
- **State Management**: Built-in state management to handle timer states seamlessly.

The `pomodoro4d` package is a great choice for developers looking to enhance user productivity through effective time management techniques.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using pomodoro4d

## Installation
To add the `pomodoro4d` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  pomodoro4d: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/pomodoro4d).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable background modes if you want notifications to work while the app is in the background. Open your `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode, go to the "Capabilities" tab, and enable "Background Modes" with "Audio, AirPlay, and Picture in Picture" checked.

## Using the Package
To use the `pomodoro4d` package, you can create a simple timer interface. Below is a basic example of how to set up the timer and handle its states.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pomodoro4d/pomodoro4d.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late Pomodoro4D _pomodoro;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the Pomodoro timer with default settings
    _pomodoro = Pomodoro4D(
      workDuration: Duration(minutes: 25),
      breakDuration: Duration(minutes: 5),
      longBreakDuration: Duration(minutes: 15),
      cyclesBeforeLongBreak: 4,
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Pomodoro Timer')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Time Left: ${_pomodoro.remainingTime}'),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Start the Pomodoro timer
                _pomodoro.start();
              },
              child: Text('Start'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Stop the Pomodoro timer
                _pomodoro.stop();
              },
              child: Text('Stop'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Pomodoro timer with start and stop functionality. The timer displays the remaining time and allows users to control the timer easily.

# Complete Example of Using pomodoro4d

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pomodoro4d/pomodoro4d.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late Pomodoro4D _pomodoro;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the Pomodoro timer with default settings
    _pomodoro = Pomodoro4D(
      workDuration: Duration(minutes: 25), // Set work duration to 25 minutes
      breakDuration: Duration(minutes: 5),  // Set short break duration to 5 minutes
      longBreakDuration: Duration(minutes: 15), // Set long break duration to 15 minutes
      cyclesBeforeLongBreak: 4, // Set number of cycles before a long break
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Pomodoro Timer')),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Display the remaining time in the timer
              Text('Time Left: ${_pomodoro.remainingTime}'),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Start the Pomodoro timer
                  _pomodoro.start();
                },
                child: Text('Start'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Stop the Pomodoro timer
                  _pomodoro.stop();
                },
                child: Text('Stop'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, initializing the Pomodoro timer with specified durations.
// 3. The build method constructs the UI, displaying the remaining time and buttons to start/stop the timer.
// 4. When the "Start" button is pressed, the timer begins counting down.
// 5. The "Stop" button halts the timer, allowing users to pause their work.
// 6. The UI updates dynamically to reflect the remaining time as the timer runs.
