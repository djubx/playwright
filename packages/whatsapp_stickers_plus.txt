# Complete Example of WhatsApp Stickers Plus

Here is a complete Flutter application that demonstrates how to use the `whatsapp_stickers_plus` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:whatsapp_stickers_plus/whatsapp_stickers_plus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'WhatsApp Stickers Example',
      home: StickerHome(),
    );
  }
}

class StickerHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _StickerHomeState createState() => _StickerHomeState();
}

class _StickerHomeState extends State<StickerHome> {
  // Create a sticker pack
  final List<Sticker> stickers = [
    Sticker('sticker1', 'assets/stickers/sticker1.png'),
    Sticker('sticker2', 'assets/stickers/sticker2.png'),
    Sticker('sticker3', 'assets/stickers/sticker3.png'),
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('WhatsApp Stickers'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Share the sticker pack
            WhatsAppStickersPlus.addStickerPack(
              'My Sticker Pack',
              'My custom stickers',
              stickers,
            );
          },
          child: Text('Add Stickers to WhatsApp'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and home set to StickerHome.
// 3. The StickerHome widget is a stateful widget that manages the sticker pack.
// 4. Inside the StickerHomeState, we define a list of stickers with their names and asset paths.
// 5. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a button.
// 6. When the button is pressed, the addStickerPack method is called to add the sticker pack to WhatsApp.
// 7. Users can then access the stickers in their WhatsApp application.
