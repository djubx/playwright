// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user opens the app and is presented with a screen containing two buttons: "Add Sticker" and "Save Pack".
// 2. When the user clicks the "Add Sticker" button, a new sticker is added to the pack with the image file name "sticker1.png" and the emoji "ðŸ˜Š".
// 3. When the user clicks the "Save Pack" button, the pack is saved to the device.
// 4. The user can then open WhatsApp and go to the stickers section to see the newly added sticker pack.

// In summary, this code creates a simple app that allows users to add stickers to a pack and save the pack to their device. The pack can then be used in WhatsApp.
