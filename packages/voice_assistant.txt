# Tutorial: Setting Up the Voice Assistant Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **voice_assistant** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the **voice_assistant** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  voice_assistant: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version required
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request microphone access:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to the microphone for voice commands.</string>
<key>NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to speech recognition.</string>
```

## Step 3: Import the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:voice_assistant/voice_assistant.dart';
```

## Step 4: Initialize the Voice Assistant
You can now initialize the voice assistant in your main application file. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set it up:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: VoiceAssistantDemo(),
    );
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Using the Voice Assistant
You can now use the voice assistant features in your application. For example, you can start listening for voice commands and respond accordingly.

```dart
class VoiceAssistantDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _VoiceAssistantDemoState createState() => _VoiceAssistantDemoState();
}

class _VoiceAssistantDemoState extends State<VoiceAssistantDemo> {
  String _recognizedText = "Say something...";

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    VoiceAssistant.initialize();
  }

  void _startListening() {
    VoiceAssistant.startListening().then((result) {
      setState(() {
        _recognizedText = result;
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Voice Assistant Demo")),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text(_recognizedText),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _startListening,
              child: Text("Start Listening"),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code initializes the voice assistant, starts listening for voice commands, and displays the recognized text on the screen.

# Complete Example of Voice Assistant in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:voice_assistant/voice_assistant.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: VoiceAssistantDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class VoiceAssistantDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _VoiceAssistantDemoState createState() => _VoiceAssistantDemoState();
}

class _VoiceAssistantDemoState extends State<VoiceAssistantDemo> {
  String _recognizedText = "Say something..."; // Variable to hold recognized text

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    VoiceAssistant.initialize(); // Initialize the voice assistant
  }

  // Function to start listening for voice commands
  void _startListening() {
    VoiceAssistant.startListening().then((result) {
      setState(() {
        _recognizedText = result; // Update the recognized text
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Voice Assistant Demo")), // App bar title
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text(_recognizedText), // Display recognized text
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _startListening, // Start listening on button press
              child: Text("Start Listening"),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with VoiceAssistantDemo as the home widget.
// 3. In VoiceAssistantDemo, the voice assistant is initialized in initState.
// 4. When the "Start Listening" button is pressed, _startListening is called.
// 5. _startListening invokes the voice assistant to listen for commands.
// 6. The recognized text is updated and displayed on the screen.
```
