# Overview of the `sticky_az_list` Flutter Package

The `sticky_az_list` package is a powerful Flutter library designed to create alphabetical lists with sticky headers. This package is particularly useful when you need to display a large set of data that can be categorized alphabetically, such as contact lists, product catalogs, or any other data set that benefits from alphabetical sorting and quick navigation.

## When to Use `sticky_az_list`

- **Contact Lists**: Displaying a list of contacts sorted alphabetically by name.
- **Product Catalogs**: Organizing products by brand or category.
- **Directory Listings**: Any directory-like data that benefits from alphabetical sorting.

## Features

- **Sticky Headers**: Headers remain at the top of the list until the next header is reached.
- **Alphabetical Indexing**: Quick navigation through the list using an alphabetical index.
- **Customizable Appearance**: Easily customize the look and feel of the list and headers.
- **Efficient Performance**: Optimized for large data sets with smooth scrolling.

The `sticky_az_list` package simplifies the implementation of complex list views, making it an essential tool for developers looking to enhance their Flutter applications with organized and user-friendly list interfaces.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `sticky_az_list`

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up and using the `sticky_az_list` package in a Flutter project. We will cover platform-specific configurations for both Android and iOS to ensure smooth integration.

## Setup Process

1. **Add Dependency**

   First, add the `sticky_az_list` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     sticky_az_list: ^1.0.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**

   Run the following command to install the new package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configurations**

   - **Android**: Ensure your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

     ```gradle
     android {
         defaultConfig {
             minSdkVersion 21
         }
     }
     ```

   - **iOS**: No specific configurations are required for iOS, but ensure your deployment target is set to iOS 9.0 or higher in your `ios/Podfile`:

     ```ruby
     platform :ios, '9.0'
     ```

## Using the Package

To use the `sticky_az_list` package, import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:sticky_az_list/sticky_az_list.dart';
```

You can now create a list using the `RealFlutter` class, which will be our main class for this example. Customize the list and headers as needed to fit your application's design.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sticky_az_list/sticky_az_list.dart';

void main() => runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sticky AZ List Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  final List<String> items = List<String>.generate(100, (i) => "Item $i");

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Sticky AZ List Example'),
      ),
      body: AZListView(
        data: items,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          // Build each list item
          return ListTile(
            title: Text(items[index]),
          );
        },
        indexBarOptions: IndexBarOptions(
          needRebuild: true,
          indexHintAlignment: Alignment.centerRight,
          indexHintTextStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
          indexHintBackgroundColor: Colors.black,
        ),
        indexBarMargin: EdgeInsets.all(10),
        indexBarWidth: 30,
        indexBarItemHeight: 20,
        indexBarAlignment: Alignment.centerRight,
        indexBarData: List<String>.generate(26, (index) => String.fromCharCode(index + 65)),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The `main` function initializes the app and sets `MyApp` as the root widget.
// `MyApp` is a stateless widget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// The home of the app is set to `RealFlutter`, which is our main class for this example.
// `RealFlutter` is a stateless widget that creates a list of 100 items for demonstration.
// The `AZListView` widget is used to display the list with sticky headers and an index bar.
// `itemBuilder` is used to build each item in the list, displaying the item text.
// `indexBarOptions` configures the appearance and behavior of the index bar.
// The index bar is aligned to the right and allows quick navigation through the list.

// Application Flow:
// 1. The app starts with the `main` function, launching `MyApp`.
// 2. `MyApp` sets up the MaterialApp and displays `RealFlutter` as the home screen.
// 3. `RealFlutter` builds a scaffold with an app bar and a body containing `AZListView`.
// 4. `AZListView` displays a list of items with sticky headers and an index bar for navigation.
// 5. Users can scroll through the list or use the index bar to jump to specific sections.
