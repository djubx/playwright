# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Sliver Bar Chart Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **sliver_bar_chart** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  sliver_bar_chart: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the sliver bar chart, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:sliver_bar_chart/sliver_bar_chart.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Sliver Bar Chart

You can now use the `SliverBarChart` widget in your application. Below is a simple example of how to implement it.

# Complete Example of Sliver Bar Chart

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sliver_bar_chart/sliver_bar_chart.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sliver Bar Chart Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Sliver Bar Chart Example'),
        ),
        body: CustomScrollView(
          slivers: <Widget>[
            SliverToBoxAdapter(
              child: Padding(
                padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
                child: Text(
                  'Monthly Sales Data',
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
                ),
              ),
            ),
            SliverBarChart(
              data: [
                BarData('Jan', 30),
                BarData('Feb', 50),
                BarData('Mar', 70),
                BarData('Apr', 90),
                BarData('May', 60),
                BarData('Jun', 80),
              ],
              barColor: Colors.blue,
              barWidth: 20,
              spacing: 10,
              onBarTap: (index) {
                // Handle bar tap
                print('Tapped on ${data[index].label}');
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Sliver Bar Chart Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is a CustomScrollView, which allows for sliver widgets.
// 5. A SliverToBoxAdapter is used to display a title for the chart.
// 6. The SliverBarChart widget is added to the slivers list, which takes a list of BarData objects.
// 7. Each BarData object represents a month and its corresponding sales figure.
// 8. The barColor, barWidth, and spacing properties customize the appearance of the bars.
// 9. The onBarTap callback handles user interactions with the bars, printing the tapped bar's label to the console.
