```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash

```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct deployment target set in your `ios/Podfile`. You can set it to at least 10.0:

```

## Usage
To use the `gradient_floating_button`, you can import the package in your Dart file:

```dart

```

You can then create a gradient floating button as follows:

```dart
GradientFloatingButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // Action to perform on button press
  },
  gradient: LinearGradient(
    colors: [Colors.blue, Colors.purple],
  ),
  child: Icon(Icons.add),
);
```

This will create a floating button with a blue to purple gradient and an add icon.

# Complete Example of Gradient Floating Button

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gradient_floating_button/gradient_floating_button.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Gradient Floating Button Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Gradient Floating Button Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Press the button below!'),
        ),
        // Adding the Gradient Floating Button
        floatingActionButton: GradientFloatingButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Action to perform when the button is pressed
            print('Gradient Floating Button Pressed!');
          },
          gradient: LinearGradient(
            colors: [Colors.blue, Colors.purple],
          ),
          child: Icon(Icons.add),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with a title and a Center widget displaying a text message.
// 4. The floatingActionButton property of the Scaffold is set to a GradientFloatingButton.
// 5. The button has an onPressed callback that prints a message to the console when pressed.
// 6. The button features a gradient background transitioning from blue to purple and displays an add icon.
