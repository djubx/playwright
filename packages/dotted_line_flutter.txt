# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Dotted Line Flutter

## Installation
To use the `dotted_line_flutter` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  dotted_line_flutter: ^1.0.0
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Usage
Once the package is installed, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below are the steps to implement a dotted line.

### Import the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:dotted_line_flutter/dotted_line_flutter.dart';
```

### Basic Example
You can create a simple dotted line by using the `DottedLine` widget. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

```dart
DottedLine(
  dashLength: 4.0, // Length of each dash
  dashColor: Colors.black, // Color of the dashes
  lineThickness: 2.0, // Thickness of the line
  dashGapLength: 4.0, // Gap between dashes
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details
- **Android**: No additional configuration is required for Android.
- **iOS**: Ensure that your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`.

### Optimizations
For better performance, especially if you are using multiple dotted lines, consider using the `const` constructor where applicable.

# Complete Example of Dotted Line Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dotted_line_flutter/dotted_line_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dotted Line Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Dotted Line Flutter Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text('Section 1', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24)),
              // Create a dotted line separator
              DottedLine(
                dashLength: 4.0,
                dashColor: Colors.blue,
                lineThickness: 2.0,
                dashGapLength: 4.0,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Add some space
              Text('Section 2', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24)),
              // Another dotted line
              DottedLine(
                dashLength: 6.0,
                dashColor: Colors.red,
                lineThickness: 3.0,
                dashGapLength: 6.0,
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Dotted Line Flutter Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Column widget.
// 5. The Column has two Text widgets representing different sections.
// 6. Between the Text widgets, a DottedLine widget is added to create a visual separator.
// 7. The first DottedLine is blue, while the second is red, showcasing customization options.
// 8. The SizedBox widget adds space between the two sections for better visual separation.
