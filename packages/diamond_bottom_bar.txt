# Complete Example of Diamond Bottom Bar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:diamond_bottom_bar/diamond_bottom_bar.dart'; // Import the package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the main app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Diamond Bottom Bar Example',
      home: HomeScreen(), // Set the home screen
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  int _selectedIndex = 0; // Track the selected index

  // List of widgets to display for each tab
  final List<Widget> _widgetOptions = <Widget>[
    Center(child: Text('Home')),
    Center(child: Text('Search')),
    Center(child: Text('Profile')),
  ];

  // Function to handle tab changes
  void _onItemTapped(int index) {
    setState(() {
      _selectedIndex = index; // Update the selected index
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Diamond Bottom Bar Example'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: _widgetOptions.elementAt(_selectedIndex), // Display the selected widget
      bottomNavigationBar: DiamondBottomBar(
        currentIndex: _selectedIndex, // Current selected index
        onTap: _onItemTapped, // Handle tap events
        items: [
          DiamondBottomBarItem(
            icon: Icons.home,
            title: 'Home',
            activeColor: Colors.blue,
            inactiveColor: Colors.grey,
          ),
          DiamondBottomBarItem(
            icon: Icons.search,
            title: 'Search',
            activeColor: Colors.blue,
            inactiveColor: Colors.grey,
          ),
          DiamondBottomBarItem(
            icon: Icons.person,
            title: 'Profile',
            activeColor: Colors.blue,
            inactiveColor: Colors.grey,
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget maintains the state of the selected index for the bottom navigation.
// 4. The _widgetOptions list contains the widgets to display for each tab.
// 5. The _onItemTapped function updates the selected index when a tab is tapped.
// 6. The Scaffold widget contains an AppBar and a body that displays the currently selected widget.
// 7. The DiamondBottomBar is configured with the current index, tap handler, and navigation items.
// 8. Each DiamondBottomBarItem specifies an icon, title, and colors for active/inactive states.
```
