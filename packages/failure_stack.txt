# Overview of the `failure_stack` Flutter Package

The `failure_stack` package is a powerful tool designed to help Flutter developers manage and handle errors and failures in a structured way. It provides a way to capture, store, and analyze failures that occur during the execution of an application, making it easier to debug and improve the overall reliability of your app.

## When to Use `failure_stack`

You should consider using the `failure_stack` package in scenarios where:
- You need to track multiple failures that may occur in your application.
- You want to implement a robust error handling mechanism that allows for easy debugging.
- You are developing applications that require a clear understanding of failure points for analytics or reporting.

## Key Features
- **Failure Tracking**: Capture and store multiple failures in a stack-like structure.
- **Custom Failure Types**: Define custom failure types to categorize errors effectively.
- **Error Reporting**: Easily report failures to external services or log them for analysis.
- **Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing Flutter applications without significant overhead.

By leveraging the `failure_stack` package, developers can enhance their error handling capabilities, leading to more resilient applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `failure_stack`

## Installation

To add the `failure_stack` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  failure_stack: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/failure_stack).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter and the `failure_stack` package.

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage

To use the `failure_stack` package, you need to create an instance of the `FailureStack` class and start capturing failures. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:failure_stack/failure_stack.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  final FailureStack failureStack = FailureStack();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Failure Stack Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Simulate a failure
              failureStack.addFailure(CustomFailure('An error occurred!'));
            },
            child: Text('Trigger Failure'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a button that, when pressed, simulates a failure by adding a `CustomFailure` to the `FailureStack`.

# Complete Example of `failure_stack`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:failure_stack/failure_stack.dart';

// Main entry point of the Flutter application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  // Create an instance of FailureStack to manage failures
  final FailureStack failureStack = FailureStack();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Failure Stack Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Simulate a failure when the button is pressed
              failureStack.addFailure(CustomFailure('An error occurred!'));
              // Display the current failures in the stack
              showDialog(
                context: context,
                builder: (context) {
                  return AlertDialog(
                    title: Text('Failures'),
                    content: Text(failureStack.toString()), // Show failures
                    actions: [
                      TextButton(
                        onPressed: () {
                          Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close dialog
                        },
                        child: Text('Close'),
                      ),
                    ],
                  );
                },
              );
            },
            child: Text('Trigger Failure'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main() function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. Inside RealFlutter, an instance of FailureStack is created to manage failures.
// 3. The UI consists of a button that, when pressed, simulates a failure by adding a CustomFailure to the stack.
// 4. After adding the failure, an AlertDialog is displayed showing the current failures in the stack.
// 5. The user can close the dialog to return to the main screen.
```

## Summary of Application Flow
The application begins by initializing the `RealFlutter` widget, which contains a button. When the button is pressed, it simulates a failure by adding a `CustomFailure` to the `FailureStack`. An alert dialog then displays the current failures, allowing the user to see what has been captured. This simple flow demonstrates how to integrate the `failure_stack` package into a Flutter application effectively.
