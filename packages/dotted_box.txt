  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Dotted Box Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: DottedBox(
          child: Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(20.0),
            child: Text('Hello, Dotted Box!'),
          ),
          color: Colors.blue,
          strokeWidth: 2.0,
          dashPattern: [4, 2], // Customize the dash pattern
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Platform-Specific Details

# Complete Example of Dotted Box

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dotted_box/dotted_box.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dotted Box Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Dotted Box Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: DottedBox(
          // The DottedBox widget creates a dotted border around its child
          child: Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(20.0),
            child: Text('Hello, Dotted Box!'),
          ),
          color: Colors.blue, // Set the color of the dots
          strokeWidth: 2.0, // Set the width of the dots
          dashPattern: [4, 2], // Customize the dash pattern
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and home.
// 3. The home of the MaterialApp is set to RealFlutter, which is another StatelessWidget.
// 4. In RealFlutter, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a DottedBox is used to wrap a Padding widget containing a Text widget.
// 6. The DottedBox creates a dotted border around the text, with customizable properties for color, stroke width, and dash pattern.
// 7. The app displays a simple interface with a dotted box around the text "Hello, Dotted Box!".
