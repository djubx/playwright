# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Chakre PDF Viewer

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **chakre_pdf_viewer** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the **chakre_pdf_viewer** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  chakre_pdf_viewer: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/chakre_pdf_viewer).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions to read external storage if you plan to load PDFs from the device. Add the following lines inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you need to add the following key to your `Info.plist` file to allow file access:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to load PDF files.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the **chakre_pdf_viewer** package.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:chakre_pdf_viewer/chakre_pdf_viewer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Chakre PDF Viewer Example',
      home: PDFViewerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PDFViewerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PDFViewerScreenState createState() => _PDFViewerScreenState();
}

class _PDFViewerScreenState extends State<PDFViewerScreen> {
  // Variable to hold the PDF document
  PDFDocument? document;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Load the PDF document from assets
    loadPDF();
  }

  // Function to load the PDF document
  Future<void> loadPDF() async {
    // Load the PDF document from assets
    document = await PDFDocument.fromAsset('assets/sample.pdf');
    // Update the state to reflect the loaded document
    setState(() {});
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('PDF Viewer'),
      ),
      body: document == null
          ? Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator()) // Show loading indicator while the PDF is loading
          : PDFViewer(
              document: document!, // Pass the loaded document to the PDFViewer
              zoomSteps: 1, // Set zoom steps for the viewer
            ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets PDFViewerScreen as the home.
// 3. PDFViewerScreen is a stateful widget that loads a PDF document when initialized.
// 4. The loadPDF function loads a PDF from the assets and updates the state.
// 5. While the PDF is loading, a CircularProgressIndicator is displayed.
// 6. Once the PDF is loaded, it is displayed using the PDFViewer widget.
```
