## When to Use Riff Switch

You might consider using the **riff_switch** package in scenarios such as:
- Implementing settings toggles in your app (e.g., enabling/disabling notifications).
- Creating interactive UI elements that require user input.
- Enhancing forms with toggle options for better user engagement.

## Features

- **Customizable Appearance**: The package allows you to customize the switch's appearance, including colors, sizes, and shapes.
- **Animation Support**: Smooth animations enhance the user experience when toggling between states.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that integrates seamlessly with existing Flutter applications.

Overall, the **riff_switch** package is an excellent choice for developers looking to add interactive toggle switches to their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Riff Switch

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the **riff_switch** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  riff_switch: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your `ios/Podfile` has the platform version set to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:riff_switch/riff_switch.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using Riff Switch in Your Widget

You can now use the `RiffSwitch` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
RiffSwitch(
  value: isSwitched,
  onChanged: (value) {
    setState(() {
      isSwitched = value;
    });
  },
  activeColor: Colors.green,
  inactiveColor: Colors.red,
)
```

This code snippet creates a toggle switch that changes its color based on its state.

# Complete Example of Riff Switch

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:riff_switch/riff_switch.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to hold the state of the switch
  bool isSwitched = false;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Riff Switch Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Display the current state of the switch
              Text(
                isSwitched ? 'Switch is ON' : 'Switch is OFF',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Riff Switch widget
              RiffSwitch(
                value: isSwitched,
                onChanged: (value) {
                  // Update the state when the switch is toggled
                  setState(() {
                    isSwitched = value;
                  });
                },
                activeColor: Colors.green, // Color when ON
                inactiveColor: Colors.red,  // Color when OFF
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the switch.
// 3. The isSwitched variable holds the current state of the switch (true for ON, false for OFF).
// 4. In the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. The Center widget contains a Column that displays the current state of the switch and the RiffSwitch widget.
// 6. When the switch is toggled, the onChanged callback updates the isSwitched variable and calls setState to rebuild the UI.
// 7. The text displayed updates based on the state of the switch, providing immediate feedback to the user.
```
