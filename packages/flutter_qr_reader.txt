```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_qr_reader/flutter_qr_reader.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'QR Code Scanner',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  String _result = '';

  // Step 1: Create an instance of the QRReader class
  QRReader qrReader = QRReader();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('QR Code Scanner'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              _result,
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Step 2: Create a button to scan the QR code
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () async {
                // Step 3: Call the scan method to scan the QR code
                String result = await qrReader.scan();
                setState(() {
                  _result = result;
                });
              },
              child: Text('Scan QR Code'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user opens the app and is presented with a button to scan a QR code.
// 2. When the user clicks the button, the QRReader class is instantiated and the scan method is called.
// 3. The scan method uses the device's camera to scan the QR code and returns the result as a string.
// 4. The result is then displayed on the screen.
// 5. If the user wants to scan another QR code, they can click the button again and the process repeats.
