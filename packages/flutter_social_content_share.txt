# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_social_content_share

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_social_content_share` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_social_content_share` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_social_content_share: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_social_content_share).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following entries to allow sharing:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to share images.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to save images to your photo library.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to share text and images.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_social_content_share/flutter_social_content_share.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Social Content Share Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Share text
                  FlutterSocialContentShare.shareToFacebook(
                    text: "Check out this amazing app!",
                  );
                },
                child: Text('Share to Facebook'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Share an image
                  FlutterSocialContentShare.shareToInstagram(
                    imagePath: 'path_to_your_image.png',
                  );
                },
                child: Text('Share to Instagram'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app with two buttons that allow users to share text to Facebook and an image to Instagram.

# Complete Example of flutter_social_content_share

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_social_content_share/flutter_social_content_share.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Social Content Share Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Share text to Facebook
                  FlutterSocialContentShare.shareToFacebook(
                    text: "Check out this amazing app!",
                  );
                },
                child: Text('Share to Facebook'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Share an image to Instagram
                  FlutterSocialContentShare.shareToInstagram(
                    imagePath: 'path_to_your_image.png',
                  );
                },
                child: Text('Share to Instagram'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, we have an AppBar and a Center widget containing a Column.
// 4. The Column has two ElevatedButtons:
//    - The first button shares a text message to Facebook when pressed.
//    - The second button shares an image to Instagram when pressed.
// 5. The share functions utilize the flutter_social_content_share package to perform the sharing actions.
