# Tutorial: Setting Up ImageView360

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the ImageView360 package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the ImageView360 package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  imageview360: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/imageview360).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` to allow for proper image loading:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to display images.</string>
```

## Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:imageview360/imageview360.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using ImageView360

You can now use the ImageView360 widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:imageview360/imageview360.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('360 Image Viewer'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ImageView360(
            image: AssetImage('assets/your_360_image.jpg'), // Replace with your image path
            zoomable: true, // Enable zoom functionality
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays a 360-degree image. The `ImageView360` widget takes an image and allows users to interact with it.

Now you are ready to run your application and see the 360-degree image viewer in action!

# Complete Example of ImageView360

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:imageview360/imageview360.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('360 Image Viewer'), // Title of the app
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ImageView360(
            image: AssetImage('assets/your_360_image.jpg'), // Load your 360 image from assets
            zoomable: true, // Enable zoom functionality for detailed viewing
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the app
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp, which provides the app structure.
// 3. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold widget is created, which includes an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The AppBar displays the title "360 Image Viewer" at the top of the screen.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget, which centers its child widget.
// 6. The child of the Center widget is the ImageView360 widget, which displays a 360-degree image.
// 7. The image is loaded from the assets folder, and the zoomable property is set to true, allowing users to zoom in and out.
// 8. When the app runs, users can swipe to rotate the image and pinch to zoom, providing an interactive experience.
```

In summary, the ImageView360 package provides a robust solution for integrating 360-degree image viewing capabilities into Flutter applications. By following the setup and usage instructions outlined in this blog, developers can create engaging and interactive experiences for their users.
