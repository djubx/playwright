# Overview of the obsobject Flutter Package

The `obsobject` package is a powerful state management solution for Flutter applications that leverages the observer pattern. It allows developers to create reactive data models that automatically update the UI when the underlying data changes. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to manage complex states or when building applications that require real-time updates.

## When to Use `obsobject`
- **Real-time Applications**: Ideal for chat applications, live dashboards, or any app that requires real-time data updates.
- **Complex State Management**: When your application has multiple states that need to be synchronized across different widgets.
- **Reactive Programming**: If you prefer a reactive programming model that simplifies the management of state changes.

## Key Features
- **Reactive Data Models**: Automatically notify listeners when data changes.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead compared to other state management solutions.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate into existing Flutter applications.
- **Observer Pattern**: Utilizes the observer pattern for efficient state management.

# Setting Up and Using the obsobject Package

## Installation
To use the `obsobject` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  obsobject: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/obsobject).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No specific configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `obsobject` package, you will typically create a model class that extends `Observable`. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:obsobject/obsobject.dart';

class CounterModel extends Observable {
  int _count = 0;

  int get count => _count;

  void increment() {
    _count++;
    notifyListeners(); // Notify listeners about the change
  }
}
```

In your Flutter widget, you can then listen to changes in the `CounterModel`:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:obsobject/obsobject.dart';

class CounterWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  final CounterModel model;

  CounterWidget(this.model);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Observer(
      builder: (_) => Text('Count: ${model.count}'),
    );
  }
}
```

This setup allows the `CounterWidget` to automatically rebuild whenever the `count` changes.

# Complete Example of Using obsobject

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:obsobject/obsobject.dart';

// Main entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// MyApp is the root widget of the application
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'obsobject Example',
      home: CounterPage(),
    );
  }
}

// CounterModel is the observable model that holds the state
class CounterModel extends Observable {
  int _count = 0;

  int get count => _count;

  void increment() {
    _count++;
    notifyListeners(); // Notify listeners about the change
  }
}

// CounterPage is the main page of the application
class CounterPage extends StatelessWidget {
  final CounterModel model = CounterModel(); // Create an instance of CounterModel

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('obsobject Counter Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Observer widget listens to changes in the model
            Observer(
              builder: (_) => Text(
                'Count: ${model.count}', // Display the current count
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: model.increment, // Increment the count on button press
              child: Text('Increment'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The app starts with the main() function, which runs MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds the MaterialApp and sets CounterPage as the home widget.
// 3. CounterPage creates an instance of CounterModel.
// 4. The Observer widget listens for changes in the model and rebuilds when the count changes.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the increment method is called, updating the count and notifying listeners.
// 6. The UI updates automatically to reflect the new count value.
