# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using map_picker_flutter

## Installation
To use the `map_picker_flutter` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  map_picker_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/map_picker_flutter).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys for location permissions:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show nearby places.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show nearby places.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `map_picker_flutter` package, you can create a simple widget that allows users to pick a location. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:map_picker_flutter/map_picker_flutter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Map Picker Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Open the map picker
              showDialog(
                context: context,
                builder: (context) {
                  return MapPickerDialog();
                },
              );
            },
            child: Text('Pick a Location'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a simple Flutter application with a button that opens the map picker dialog when pressed.

# Complete Example of map_picker_flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:map_picker_flutter/map_picker_flutter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Map Picker Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Open the map picker dialog
              showDialog(
                context: context,
                builder: (context) {
                  return MapPickerDialog(
                    onLocationPicked: (location) {
                      // Handle the location picked by the user
                      print("Location picked: ${location.latitude}, ${location.longitude}");
                      Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                    },
                  );
                },
              );
            },
            child: Text('Pick a Location'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, there's an AppBar and a Center widget containing an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, a dialog is shown that contains the MapPickerDialog.
// 5. The user can interact with the map to select a location.
// 6. Once a location is picked, the onLocationPicked callback is triggered, printing the selected coordinates to the console.
// 7. The dialog is then closed, returning the user to the main screen.
