## Setup Process

To use the `read_more_less` package in your Flutter application, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `read_more_less` package under dependencies.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     read_more_less: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
   ```

2. **Install the Package**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21.
   - **iOS**: No additional configuration is required for iOS, but ensure your deployment target is set appropriately in `ios/Podfile`.

4. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the package:

   ```dart
   import 'package:read_more_less/read_more_less.dart';
   ```

## Using the Package

To use the `read_more_less` package, you can create a simple widget that utilizes the `ReadMoreLess` widget provided by the package. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
ReadMoreLess(
  text: 'Your long text goes here...',
  trimLines: 2, // Number of lines to show before expanding
  colorClickableText: Colors.blue, // Color of the clickable text
  trimMode: TrimMode.Line, // Mode to trim the text
  trimCollapsedText: 'Read more', // Text to show when collapsed
  trimExpandedText: 'Read less', // Text to show when expanded
  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16), // Text style
)
```

This widget will display the text, showing only the specified number of lines initially, and will provide options to expand or collapse the text.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:read_more_less/read_more_less.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Read More Less Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Read More Less Example'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Column(
            children: [
              Text(
                'Example of Read More Less Package',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ReadMoreLess(
                text: 'Flutter is an open-source UI software development toolkit created by Google. '
                      'It is used to develop applications for Android, iOS, Linux, Mac, Windows, '
                      'Google Fuchsia, and the web from a single codebase. Flutter is based on the Dart programming language.',
                trimLines: 2, // Show only 2 lines initially
                colorClickableText: Colors.blue, // Color for the clickable text
                trimMode: TrimMode.Line, // Trim mode to use
                trimCollapsedText: 'Read more', // Text when collapsed
                trimExpandedText: 'Read less', // Text when expanded
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16), // Text style
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with MyApp as the root widget.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Read More Less Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold has a Padding widget to provide space around the content.
// 5. Inside the Padding, a Column widget is used to arrange the title and the ReadMoreLess widget vertically.
// 6. The ReadMoreLess widget displays a long text, initially showing only two lines, with options to expand or collapse the text.
// 7. The text style and clickable text color are customizable, enhancing the user experience.
