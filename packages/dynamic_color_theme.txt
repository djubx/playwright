# Dynamic Color Theme Package for Flutter

The `dynamic_color_theme` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to implement dynamic theming in their applications. This package allows you to create themes that adapt to the user's preferences, such as light and dark modes, and even system-level color schemes. It is particularly useful for applications that aim to provide a personalized user experience by automatically adjusting the UI based on the user's settings.

## When to Use This Package
- **User Preference**: When you want your app to respect the user's system theme preferences.
- **Dynamic Theming**: If your app requires themes that can change dynamically based on user interactions or settings.
- **Enhanced UX**: To improve user experience by providing a visually appealing interface that adapts to different environments.

## Features
- **Automatic Theme Switching**: Automatically switches between light and dark themes based on system settings.
- **Customizable Themes**: Allows developers to define custom themes that can be applied dynamically.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API for integrating dynamic theming into existing Flutter applications.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures that the UI remains consistent and visually appealing across different themes.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Dynamic Color Theme

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `dynamic_color_theme` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Package to Your Project
To get started, you need to add the `dynamic_color_theme` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dynamic_color_theme: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/dynamic_color_theme).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    compileSdkVersion 31 // or latest
    ...
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, make sure your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` includes the following:

```xml
<key>UIUserInterfaceStyle</key>
<string>Automatic</string>
```

This setting allows the app to adapt to the system theme.

## Step 3: Using the Package in Your App
Now that the package is added and configured, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is an example of how to implement dynamic theming.

# Complete Example of Dynamic Color Theme

Here is a complete example of a Flutter application using the `dynamic_color_theme` package. This example demonstrates how to implement dynamic theming based on user preferences.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dynamic_color_theme/dynamic_color_theme.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Using DynamicColorTheme to manage the theme
    return DynamicColorTheme(
      data: (brightness) => brightness == Brightness.dark
          ? ThemeData.dark()
          : ThemeData.light(),
      themedWidgetBuilder: (context, dynamicTheme) {
        return MaterialApp(
          title: 'Dynamic Color Theme Example',
          theme: dynamicTheme,
          home: HomeScreen(),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Dynamic Color Theme'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Current Theme:'),
            // Displaying the current theme mode
            Text(
              MediaQuery.of(context).platformBrightness == Brightness.dark
                  ? 'Dark Mode'
                  : 'Light Mode',
              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline4,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Toggling the theme
                DynamicColorTheme.of(context).toggleTheme();
              },
              child: Text('Toggle Theme'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter uses DynamicColorTheme to manage the app's theme.
// 3. The themedWidgetBuilder provides the current theme to the MaterialApp.
// 4. HomeScreen is displayed as the main screen of the app.
// 5. The app shows the current theme mode (light or dark) and a button to toggle the theme.
// 6. When the button is pressed, the theme toggles between light and dark modes.
```

In summary, the `dynamic_color_theme` package provides a straightforward way to implement dynamic theming in Flutter applications. By following the setup and usage instructions, developers can create applications that respect user preferences and enhance the overall user experience. The provided example illustrates how to toggle between themes, making it easy to integrate this functionality into your own projects.
