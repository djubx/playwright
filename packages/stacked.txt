Here's a detailed technical blog on the "stacked" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Stacked Flutter Package

The **stacked** Flutter package is a powerful state management solution that simplifies the development of Flutter applications by promoting a clean architecture. It is designed to help developers manage their app's state in a more organized and efficient manner, making it easier to build scalable applications.

## When to Use the Stacked Package

You should consider using the stacked package when:
- You are building a complex application that requires a clear separation of concerns.
- You want to implement a reactive programming model that allows for easy state management.
- You need to manage multiple views and their corresponding states efficiently.

## Key Features
- **ViewModel**: The core concept of the stacked package is the ViewModel, which holds the state and business logic of your application.
- **Reactive Programming**: The package uses reactive programming principles, allowing your UI to automatically update when the underlying data changes.
- **Dependency Injection**: Built-in support for dependency injection makes it easy to manage dependencies across your application.
- **Navigation**: Simplified navigation management that integrates seamlessly with the ViewModel.

By leveraging these features, developers can create maintainable and testable applications that adhere to best practices in Flutter development.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Stacked Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the stacked package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  stacked: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Setting Up Your Project

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to set the platform version in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Creating Your First ViewModel

Create a new Dart file for your ViewModel, for example, `counter_viewmodel.dart`:

```dart
import 'package:stacked/stacked.dart';

class CounterViewModel extends BaseViewModel {
  int _counter = 0;

  int get counter => _counter;

  void increment() {
    _counter++;
    notifyListeners(); // Notify listeners to update the UI
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Creating Your View

Now, create a new Dart file for your view, for example, `counter_view.dart`:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:stacked/stacked.dart';
import 'counter_viewmodel.dart';

class CounterView extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ViewModelBuilder<CounterViewModel>.reactive(
      viewModelBuilder: () => CounterViewModel(),
      builder: (context, model, child) => Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Counter App')),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(
            'Counter: ${model.counter}',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
          ),
        ),
        floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
          onPressed: model.increment,
          child: Icon(Icons.add),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Updating the Main File

Finally, update your `main.dart` file to use the new view:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'counter_view.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Stacked Example',
      home: CounterView(),
    );
  }
}
```

Now you can run your application using:

```bash
flutter run
```

This will launch a simple counter application that demonstrates the use of the stacked package.

# Complete Example of a Flutter Application Using Stacked

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart'; // Import Flutter material package
import 'package:stacked/stacked.dart'; // Import stacked package for state management

// ViewModel class to manage the state of the counter
class CounterViewModel extends BaseViewModel {
  int _counter = 0; // Private variable to hold the counter value

  int get counter => _counter; // Public getter to access the counter value

  void increment() {
    _counter++; // Increment the counter
    notifyListeners(); // Notify listeners to update the UI
  }
}

// Main view class that displays the counter
class CounterView extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Using ViewModelBuilder to create and manage the ViewModel
    return ViewModelBuilder<CounterViewModel>.reactive(
      viewModelBuilder: () => CounterViewModel(), // Create an instance of the ViewModel
      builder: (context, model, child) => Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Counter App')), // AppBar with title
        body: Center(
          child: Text(
            'Counter: ${model.counter}', // Display the current counter value
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24), // Text style for the counter
          ),
        ),
        floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
          onPressed: model.increment, // Call increment method on button press
          child: Icon(Icons.add), // Icon for the button
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Main application entry point
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp()); // Run the MyApp widget
}

// Main application widget
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Stacked Example', // Title of the application
      home: CounterView(), // Set the home view to CounterView
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with the title 'Stacked Example' and sets the home to CounterView.
// 3. CounterView uses ViewModelBuilder to create an instance of CounterViewModel.
// 4. The UI displays the current counter value and a FloatingActionButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the increment() method in the ViewModel is called, which updates the counter and notifies listeners.
// 6. The UI automatically rebuilds to reflect the updated counter value.
```
