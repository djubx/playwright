# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Advanced DataTable Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **advanced_datatable** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  advanced_datatable: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/advanced_datatable).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:advanced_datatable/advanced_datatable.dart';
```

## Step 4: Basic Usage

To use the **advanced_datatable**, you can create a simple data table as follows:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:advanced_datatable/advanced_datatable.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Advanced DataTable Example')),
        body: AdvancedDataTable(
          columns: [
            DataColumn(label: Text('ID')),
            DataColumn(label: Text('Name')),
            DataColumn(label: Text('Age')),
          ],
          rows: [
            DataRow(cells: [
              DataCell(Text('1')),
              DataCell(Text('Alice')),
              DataCell(Text('30')),
            ]),
            DataRow(cells: [
              DataCell(Text('2')),
              DataCell(Text('Bob')),
              DataCell(Text('25')),
            ]),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic data table with three columns and two rows. You can expand this example by adding more features like sorting, filtering, and pagination.

# Complete Example of Advanced DataTable

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:advanced_datatable/advanced_datatable.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Advanced DataTable Example')),
        body: AdvancedDataTable(
          // Define the columns of the data table
          columns: [
            DataColumn(label: Text('ID')),
            DataColumn(label: Text('Name')),
            DataColumn(label: Text('Age')),
          ],
          // Define the rows of the data table
          rows: [
            DataRow(cells: [
              DataCell(Text('1')), // First cell in the first row
              DataCell(Text('Alice')), // Second cell in the first row
              DataCell(Text('30')), // Third cell in the first row
            ]),
            DataRow(cells: [
              DataCell(Text('2')), // First cell in the second row
              DataCell(Text('Bob')), // Second cell in the second row
              DataCell(Text('25')), // Third cell in the second row
            ]),
          ],
          // Enable sorting on the columns
          onSort: (columnIndex, ascending) {
            // Implement sorting logic here
          },
          // Enable row selection
          onRowSelect: (selectedRows) {
            // Handle row selection here
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the `RealFlutter` class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The `MaterialApp` widget is created, providing the basic structure of the app.
// 3. A `Scaffold` widget is used to create the app's layout, including an AppBar and body.
// 4. The `AdvancedDataTable` widget is instantiated in the body of the Scaffold.
// 5. The columns of the data table are defined using `DataColumn` widgets.
// 6. The rows of the data table are defined using `DataRow` and `DataCell` widgets.
// 7. Sorting and row selection functionalities are set up with callbacks for further implementation.
```
