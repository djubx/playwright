## Part 2: Tutorial

<!-- START_TUTORIAL -->
### Setting Up the `flutter_usb_printer` Package

To get started with the `flutter_usb_printer` package, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_usb_printer: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_usb_printer).

#### Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

**For Android:**
1. Open `AndroidManifest.xml` located in `android/app/src/main/`.
2. Add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_USB"/>
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.usb.host"/>
```

3. Ensure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

**For iOS:**
1. Open `Info.plist` located in `ios/Runner/`.
2. Add the following keys to request permission for USB access:

```xml
<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need Bluetooth access to connect to USB printers.</string>
<key>NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need Bluetooth access to connect to USB printers.</string>
```

#### Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_usb_printer/flutter_usb_printer.dart';
```

#### Step 4: Initialize the Printer

Before using the printer, you need to initialize it. This can be done in your main application file or wherever you handle your printing logic.

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await FlutterUsbPrinter.init();
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

#### Step 5: Using the Printer

You can now use the printer to print documents. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to print a text:

```dart
void printText() async {
  final printer = FlutterUsbPrinter();
  await printer.connect();
  await printer.print("Hello, USB Printer!");
  await printer.disconnect();
}
```

This function connects to the printer, sends a print command, and then disconnects.

### Conclusion

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the `flutter_usb_printer` package in your Flutter applications. Make sure to test on actual devices, as USB printing may not work on emulators.

## Part 3: Complete Example

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_usb_printer/flutter_usb_printer.dart';

void main() async {
  // Ensure Flutter bindings are initialized
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  
  // Initialize the USB printer
  await FlutterUsbPrinter.init();
  
  // Run the main application
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'USB Printer Example',
      home: PrinterHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class PrinterHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PrinterHomePageState createState() => _PrinterHomePageState();
}

class _PrinterHomePageState extends State<PrinterHomePage> {
  // Function to print text
  void printText() async {
    final printer = FlutterUsbPrinter();
    
    // Connect to the printer
    await printer.connect();
    
    // Print a sample text
    await printer.print("Hello, USB Printer!");
    
    // Disconnect from the printer
    await printer.disconnect();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('USB Printer Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: printText, // Call printText when button is pressed
          child: Text('Print'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter environment and the USB printer.
// 2. MyApp is the root widget that sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. PrinterHomePage is the main screen with a button to trigger printing.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the printText function is called.
// 5. The printText function connects to the USB printer, sends a print command, and then disconnects.
```
<!-- END_MAIN -->

### Summary of Application Flow

// The application starts by initializing the Flutter environment and the USB printer. 
// The main widget, MyApp, sets up the MaterialApp and displays the PrinterHomePage.
// The PrinterHomePage contains a button that, when pressed, calls the printText function.
// This function handles the connection to the USB printer, sends a print command with the text "Hello, USB Printer!", 
// and finally disconnects from the printer. This simple flow demonstrates the core functionality of the `flutter_usb_printer` package.
