## Part 2: Tutorial

# Setting Up and Using dev_prokit

## Installation

To get started with `dev_prokit`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dev_prokit: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/dev_prokit).

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using dev_prokit

Once you have installed the package, you can start using its features. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use a pre-built widget from `dev_prokit`:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dev_prokit/dev_prokit.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Dev ProKit Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ProKitButton(
            title: 'Click Me',
            onPressed: () {
              // Action when button is pressed
              print('Button Pressed!');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we import the `dev_prokit` package and use the `ProKitButton` widget to create a button that prints a message when pressed.

# Complete Example of dev_prokit in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dev_prokit/dev_prokit.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dev ProKit Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ProKitButton(
          title: 'Click Me',
          onPressed: () {
            // Action when button is pressed
            showDialog(
              context: context,
              builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                title: Text('Button Pressed!'),
                content: Text('You have clicked the button.'),
                actions: [
                  TextButton(
                    onPressed: () {
                      Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                    },
                    child: Text('OK'),
                  ),
                ],
              ),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is set as the home of the MaterialApp.
// 4. HomeScreen contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a centered ProKitButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, an AlertDialog is shown with a message.
// 6. The user can dismiss the dialog by clicking the 'OK' button, which calls Navigator.of(context).pop() to close the dialog.
```
