# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `scroll_datetime_picker`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started with the `scroll_datetime_picker`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  scroll_datetime_picker: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package
In your Dart file where you want to use the date and time picker, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:scroll_datetime_picker/scroll_datetime_picker.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Picker
You can now use the `ScrollDateTimePicker` widget in your application. Below is a simple example of how to implement it in a Flutter app.

### Platform-Specific Details
- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid compatibility issues.
- **iOS**: No additional configuration is required, but ensure that your deployment target is set appropriately in `ios/Podfile`.

### Example Usage
Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to use the `ScrollDateTimePicker` in your Flutter application:

```dart
// Inside your widget build method
ScrollDateTimePicker(
  initialDateTime: DateTime.now(),
  onChanged: (dateTime) {
    // Handle the selected date and time
    print(dateTime);
  },
);
```

This will create a scrollable date and time picker that initializes with the current date and time.

## Step 5: Customization
You can customize the appearance of the picker by using various properties such as `backgroundColor`, `textColor`, and `pickerHeight`. Refer to the package documentation for a complete list of customizable properties.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate and use the `scroll_datetime_picker` package in your Flutter application effectively.

# Complete Example of Using `scroll_datetime_picker`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:scroll_datetime_picker/scroll_datetime_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Scroll DateTime Picker Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Scroll DateTime Picker'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: DateTimePickerWidget(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DateTimePickerWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DateTimePickerWidgetState createState() => _DateTimePickerWidgetState();
}

class _DateTimePickerWidgetState extends State<DateTimePickerWidget> {
  DateTime selectedDateTime = DateTime.now(); // Initialize with current date and time

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Text(
          'Selected Date and Time: ${selectedDateTime.toLocal()}',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20),
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Show the scrollable date and time picker
            showDialog(
              context: context,
              builder: (BuildContext context) {
                return AlertDialog(
                  title: Text('Select Date and Time'),
                  content: Container(
                    height: 300, // Set height for the picker
                    child: ScrollDateTimePicker(
                      initialDateTime: selectedDateTime,
                      onChanged: (dateTime) {
                        setState(() {
                          selectedDateTime = dateTime; // Update selected date and time
                        });
                      },
                    ),
                  ),
                  actions: [
                    TextButton(
                      onPressed: () {
                        Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                      },
                      child: Text('Done'),
                    ),
                  ],
                );
              },
            );
          },
          child: Text('Open DateTime Picker'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
// Explanation of the application flow:

// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds the DateTimePickerWidget.
// 4. The DateTimePickerWidget is a StatefulWidget that maintains the selected date and time.
// 5. In the build method, it displays the currently selected date and time and a button to open the picker.
// 6. When the button is pressed, an AlertDialog is shown containing the ScrollDateTimePicker.
// 7. The ScrollDateTimePicker initializes with the currently selected date and time.
// 8. When the user scrolls and selects a new date and time, the onChanged callback updates the selectedDateTime state.
// 9. The 'Done' button in the dialog closes the dialog, and the selected date and time are displayed on the main screen.
