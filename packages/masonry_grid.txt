# Masonry Grid Flutter Package

The **masonry_grid** package is a powerful Flutter widget that allows developers to create a masonry-style grid layout. This layout is particularly useful for displaying items of varying sizes in a visually appealing manner, similar to Pinterest's layout. The masonry grid automatically arranges its children in a way that optimizes space and maintains a clean, organized appearance.

## When to Use

You should consider using the masonry_grid package when:
- You need to display a collection of items with varying heights and widths.
- You want to create a Pinterest-like layout for your application.
- You are looking for a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.

## Features

- **Responsive Layout**: Automatically adjusts the layout based on the screen size and orientation.
- **Customizable**: Offers various customization options for spacing, alignment, and item sizes.
- **Performance Optimized**: Built with performance in mind, ensuring smooth scrolling and rendering.

## Example Use Cases

1. **Photo Gallery**: Displaying a collection of images where each image can have a different aspect ratio.
2. **Product Listings**: Showcasing products in an e-commerce app where product images and descriptions vary in size.
3. **Blog Posts**: Presenting articles with featured images and varying text lengths in a visually appealing grid.

By leveraging the masonry_grid package, developers can create dynamic and engaging layouts that enhance user experience.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Masonry Grid Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the masonry_grid package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  masonry_grid: ^0.3.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install the Package

Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the platform version in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the masonry_grid package:

```dart
import 'package:masonry_grid/masonry_grid.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Masonry Grid

You can now use the MasonryGrid widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
MasonryGrid.count(
  crossAxisCount: 2, // Number of columns
  itemCount: items.length, // Total number of items
  itemBuilder: (context, index) {
    return Card(
      child: Container(
        height: (index % 2 == 0) ? 150 : 200, // Varying heights
        child: Center(child: Text('Item $index')),
      ),
    );
  },
)
```

This code snippet creates a masonry grid with two columns, where each item has a varying height.

## Step 6: Customization

You can customize the spacing between items using the `mainAxisSpacing` and `crossAxisSpacing` properties:

```dart
MasonryGrid.count(
  crossAxisCount: 2,
  mainAxisSpacing: 8.0, // Vertical spacing
  crossAxisSpacing: 8.0, // Horizontal spacing
  ...
)
```

With these steps, you can easily set up and use the masonry_grid package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Masonry Grid in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:masonry_grid/masonry_grid.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Masonry Grid Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Masonry Grid Example'),
        ),
        body: MasonryGrid.count(
          crossAxisCount: 2, // Number of columns in the grid
          mainAxisSpacing: 8.0, // Space between rows
          crossAxisSpacing: 8.0, // Space between columns
          itemCount: 20, // Total number of items to display
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            return Card(
              color: Colors.blue[(index % 9 + 1) * 100], // Different shades of blue
              child: Container(
                height: (index % 2 == 0) ? 150 : 200, // Varying heights for items
                child: Center(
                  child: Text(
                    'Item $index',
                    style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
                  ),
                ),
              ),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Masonry Grid Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold uses the MasonryGrid.count widget to create a grid layout.
// 5. The grid has 2 columns, with specified spacing between items.
// 6. The itemBuilder generates a Card for each item, with varying heights and colors.
// 7. Each card displays the item index in the center, creating a visually appealing layout.
```
