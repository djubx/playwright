# Complete Example of flutter_date_picker_timeline

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_date_picker_timeline/flutter_date_picker_timeline.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Date Picker Timeline Example',
      home: DatePickerExample(),
    );
  }
}

class DatePickerExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DatePickerExampleState createState() => _DatePickerExampleState();
}

class _DatePickerExampleState extends State<DatePickerExample> {
  DateTime selectedDate = DateTime.now(); // Variable to hold the selected date

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Date Picker Timeline'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // DatePickerTimeline widget to select dates
          DatePickerTimeline(
            initialDate: selectedDate,
            onDateChange: (date) {
              // Update the selected date when the user selects a new date
              setState(() {
                selectedDate = date;
              });
            },
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between the date picker and the text
          Text(
            'Selected Date: ${selectedDate.toLocal()}'.split(' ')[0], // Display the selected date
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. The home of the MaterialApp is DatePickerExample, a StatefulWidget.
// 4. In DatePickerExample, we maintain the selected date in a state variable.
// 5. The DatePickerTimeline widget is used to display the date selection interface.
// 6. When a date is selected, the onDateChange callback updates the selected date.
// 7. The selected date is displayed below the date picker in a Text widget.
