# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_context_menu

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_context_menu` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_context_menu` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_context_menu: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_context_menu).

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_context_menu/flutter_context_menu.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

To use the context menu, wrap the widget you want to attach the menu to with the `ContextMenu` widget. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
ContextMenu(
  items: [
    ContextMenuItem(
      title: 'Edit',
      onTap: () {
        // Handle edit action
      },
    ),
    ContextMenuItem(
      title: 'Delete',
      onTap: () {
        // Handle delete action
      },
    ),
  ],
  child: GestureDetector(
    onLongPress: () {
      // Show context menu on long press
    },
    child: Container(
      padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
      color: Colors.blue,
      child: Text('Long press me!'),
    ),
  ),
);
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your app has the necessary permissions to display context menus. Typically, no additional configuration is required, but you should test the behavior on various devices to ensure consistency.

### iOS

On iOS, context menus are integrated into the native gesture system. Ensure that your app's UI is responsive to touch events, and test the context menu behavior on different iOS devices.

## Step 4: Optimizations

- **Performance**: Keep the context menu lightweight to ensure smooth performance. Avoid heavy computations in the `onTap` callbacks.
- **User Experience**: Consider the placement and timing of the context menu to enhance user experience. Test different gestures to find the most intuitive interaction.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the `flutter_context_menu` package effectively in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of flutter_context_menu

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_context_menu/flutter_context_menu.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Context Menu Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Context Menu Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ContextMenu(
            items: [
              ContextMenuItem(
                title: 'Edit',
                onTap: () {
                  // Handle edit action
                  print('Edit action triggered');
                },
              ),
              ContextMenuItem(
                title: 'Delete',
                onTap: () {
                  // Handle delete action
                  print('Delete action triggered');
                },
              ),
            ],
            child: GestureDetector(
              onLongPress: () {
                // Show context menu on long press
                print('Long pressed!');
              },
              child: Container(
                padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
                color: Colors.blue,
                child: Text(
                  'Long press me!',
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Context Menu Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers a ContextMenu widget.
// 5. The ContextMenu has two items: 'Edit' and 'Delete', each with an onTap action that prints a message to the console.
// 6. The ContextMenu wraps a GestureDetector that listens for long press gestures.
// 7. When the user long presses the container, the context menu appears, allowing them to choose an action.
// 8. The container displays the text 'Long press me!' and has a blue background, enhancing visibility.
```
