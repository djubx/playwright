# MSAL_JS Flutter Package: An Overview

The `msal_js` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to facilitate authentication in Flutter applications using the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL). This package is particularly useful for developers looking to integrate Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication into their Flutter apps, enabling secure access to Microsoft services and APIs.

## When to Use `msal_js`

- **Enterprise Applications**: If you're developing an enterprise application that requires integration with Microsoft services like Office 365, SharePoint, or Azure, `msal_js` is an ideal choice.
- **Secure Authentication**: For applications that need robust security features, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) and conditional access policies.
- **Cross-Platform Needs**: When building cross-platform applications that need consistent authentication experiences across web, Android, and iOS.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly across web, Android, and iOS platforms.
- **Secure Token Management**: Handles access and refresh tokens securely.
- **Easy Integration**: Simplifies the process of integrating Microsoft authentication into Flutter apps.
- **Customizable**: Offers flexibility to customize authentication flows and user experiences.

# Setting Up and Using `msal_js` in Flutter

In this tutorial, we'll walk through the setup process for the `msal_js` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application. We'll cover platform-specific configurations for both Android and iOS.

## Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK installed on your machine.
- A Microsoft Azure account with an app registration.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the `msal_js` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  msal_js: ^1.0.0
```

## Step 2: Configure Azure App Registration

1. **Register your application** in the Azure portal.
2. **Redirect URIs**: Set the redirect URIs for your application. For mobile, use `msauth://<package-name>`.
3. **Platform Configurations**: Ensure you configure the app for both Android and iOS platforms.

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Setup

### Android

1. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following intent filter within the `<activity>` tag:

```xml
<intent-filter>
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
    <data android:scheme="msauth" android:host="<package-name>" />
</intent-filter>
```

2. Ensure your `build.gradle` files are configured to use the correct SDK versions.

### iOS

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following URL scheme:

```xml
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
  <dict>
    <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
    <array>
      <string>msauth.<package-name></string>
    </array>
  </dict>
</array>
```

2. Ensure your iOS deployment target is set to at least 11.0.

## Step 4: Initialize and Use `msal_js`

In your Flutter application, initialize the `msal_js` package and implement authentication flows.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:msal_js/msal_js.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutterApp());
}

class RealFlutterApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'MSAL JS Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: AuthenticationPage(),
    );
  }
}

class AuthenticationPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _AuthenticationPageState createState() => _AuthenticationPageState();
}

class _AuthenticationPageState extends State<AuthenticationPage> {
  late PublicClientApplication _msal;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the MSAL client with configuration
    _msal = PublicClientApplication(Configuration(
      auth: AuthOptions(
        clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID', // Replace with your client ID
        redirectUri: 'msauth://<package-name>', // Replace with your redirect URI
      ),
    ));
  }

  Future<void> _signIn() async {
    try {
      // Attempt to sign in the user
      final result = await _msal.loginPopup(PopupRequest(
        scopes: ['user.read'], // Define the scopes you need
      ));
      // If successful, display the user's account information
      print('Access Token: ${result.accessToken}');
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during sign-in
      print('Error during sign-in: $e');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('MSAL JS Authentication'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _signIn,
          child: Text('Sign In with Microsoft'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow:
// 1. The app initializes and displays a simple UI with a sign-in button.
// 2. When the user taps the sign-in button, the `_signIn` method is called.
// 3. `_signIn` uses the MSAL client to open a popup for user authentication.
// 4. If the user successfully signs in, their access token is printed to the console.
// 5. Any errors during the sign-in process are caught and printed to the console.
```
