// The app starts by creating a Scaffold widget to provide a basic material design layout.
// The Scaffold widget contains a SimpleDrawer widget to provide a simple and customizable drawer.
// The SimpleDrawer widget is customized to have a blue background color and contains a ListView widget to provide a list of items.
// Each item in the list is a ListTile widget that provides a list item with a title and an onTap callback to handle the tap event.
// When an item is tapped, the drawer is closed and the app navigates to the next screen.
// The next screen is provided by the NextScreen widget, which contains an AppBar widget and a Center widget to center the content.
