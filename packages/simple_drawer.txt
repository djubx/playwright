# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Simple Drawer

## Installation
To get started with the simple_drawer package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  simple_drawer: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package. After saving the file, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the simple_drawer package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:simple_drawer/simple_drawer.dart';
```

You can then create a simple drawer by wrapping your main content with the `SimpleDrawer` widget. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
SimpleDrawer(
  drawer: Drawer(
    child: ListView(
      children: <Widget>[
        ListTile(title: Text('Item 1')),
        ListTile(title: Text('Item 2')),
      ],
    ),
  ),
  child: YourMainWidget(),
);
```

This setup will create a basic drawer with two items. You can customize the drawer's content and appearance as needed.

# Complete Example of Simple Drawer

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simple_drawer/simple_drawer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Simple Drawer Example',
      home: SimpleDrawer(
        // The drawer widget that will be displayed
        drawer: Drawer(
          child: ListView(
            // Creating a list of items in the drawer
            children: <Widget>[
              ListTile(
                title: Text('Home'),
                onTap: () {
                  // Handle navigation to Home
                  Navigator.pop(context);
                },
              ),
              ListTile(
                title: Text('Settings'),
                onTap: () {
                  // Handle navigation to Settings
                  Navigator.pop(context);
                },
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
        // The main content of the app
        child: Scaffold(
          appBar: AppBar(
            title: Text('Simple Drawer Example'),
            // Adding a button to open the drawer
            leading: IconButton(
              icon: Icon(Icons.menu),
              onPressed: () {
                // Open the drawer when the menu button is pressed
                SimpleDrawer.of(context)?.open();
              },
            ),
          ),
          body: Center(
            child: Text('Welcome to Simple Drawer Example!'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter class builds a MaterialApp with a title.
// 3. Inside the MaterialApp, a SimpleDrawer widget is created.
// 4. The drawer contains a ListView with two ListTile items: Home and Settings.
// 5. Tapping on a ListTile will close the drawer and can be extended to navigate to different screens.
// 6. The Scaffold widget provides an AppBar with a menu button that opens the drawer when pressed.
// 7. The body of the Scaffold displays a welcome message in the center of the screen.
