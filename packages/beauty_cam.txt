# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Beauty Cam Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the beauty_cam package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the beauty_cam package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  beauty_cam: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/beauty_cam).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
   ```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request camera access:

   ```xml
   <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your camera to take photos.</string>
   <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your photo library to save photos.</string>
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that we have set up the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. Below is a complete example demonstrating how to implement the beauty_cam package.

# Complete Example of Using the Beauty Cam Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:beauty_cam/beauty_cam.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Beauty Cam Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to hold the captured image
  String? _imagePath;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Beauty Cam'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the captured image if available
            _imagePath != null
                ? Image.file(File(_imagePath!))
                : Text('No image captured.'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _captureImage,
              child: Text('Capture Image'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to capture image using beauty_cam
  Future<void> _captureImage() async {
    // Open the beauty camera and wait for the result
    final result = await BeautyCam.openCamera();

    // Check if an image was captured
    if (result != null) {
      setState(() {
        _imagePath = result.path; // Store the image path
      });
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The home of the app is set to RealFlutter, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 3. In the RealFlutter widget, we have a variable _imagePath to hold the path of the captured image.
// 4. The build method displays the captured image if available, or a message indicating no image is captured.
// 5. When the "Capture Image" button is pressed, the _captureImage function is called.
// 6. This function opens the beauty camera using the BeautyCam.openCamera() method.
// 7. If an image is captured, its path is stored in _imagePath, triggering a UI update to display the image.
```
