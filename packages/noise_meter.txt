# Noise Meter Flutter Package

The **noise_meter** Flutter package is a powerful tool designed for measuring sound levels in real-time using the device's microphone. This package is particularly useful for applications that require sound level monitoring, such as environmental noise assessments, sound level meters, and audio analysis tools. 

## When to Use This Package
You might consider using the **noise_meter** package in scenarios such as:
- Developing a sound level meter app for personal or professional use.
- Creating educational tools that teach users about sound levels and their effects.
- Implementing features in existing applications that require sound monitoring capabilities.

## Features
- **Real-time Sound Level Measurement**: The package provides continuous monitoring of sound levels, allowing users to see changes in real-time.
- **Customizable Thresholds**: Users can set thresholds for sound levels to trigger alerts or notifications.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: The package works seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup and usage make it easy to integrate into any Flutter application.

Overall, the **noise_meter** package is an excellent choice for developers looking to incorporate sound level measurement into their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Noise Meter Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the **noise_meter** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  noise_meter: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open the `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS"/>
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open the `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to request microphone access:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to the microphone to measure sound levels.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the noise meter functionality.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:noise_meter/noise_meter.dart';
```

2. Create an instance of the `NoiseMeter` class and start measuring sound levels.

```dart
NoiseMeter noiseMeter = NoiseMeter();
```

3. Use the `noiseMeter` instance to start listening to sound levels and handle the data accordingly.

This setup will allow you to measure sound levels effectively in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using the Noise Meter Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:noise_meter/noise_meter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  NoiseMeter _noiseMeter; // Instance of NoiseMeter
  Stream<NoiseReading> _noiseStream; // Stream to hold noise readings
  String _noiseLevel = "Noise Level: 0 dB"; // Initial noise level display

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _noiseMeter = NoiseMeter(); // Initialize the NoiseMeter
    _startListening(); // Start listening to noise levels
  }

  void _startListening() {
    // Start listening to the noise levels
    _noiseStream = _noiseMeter.noiseStream;
    _noiseStream.listen((NoiseReading noiseReading) {
      // Update the UI with the latest noise level
      setState(() {
        _noiseLevel = "Noise Level: ${noiseReading.meanDecibel} dB";
      });
    }, onError: (error) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during listening
      setState(() {
        _noiseLevel = "Error: ${error.toString()}";
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _noiseMeter.dispose(); // Dispose of the NoiseMeter when done
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Noise Meter Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(
            _noiseLevel, // Display the current noise level
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the initState method, an instance of NoiseMeter is created.
// 3. The _startListening method is called to begin listening for noise levels.
// 4. The noiseStream listens for incoming noise readings and updates the UI accordingly.
// 5. If an error occurs, it updates the UI to display the error message.
// 6. The dispose method ensures that resources are cleaned up when the widget is removed from the widget tree.
// 7. The current noise level is displayed in the center of the screen.
