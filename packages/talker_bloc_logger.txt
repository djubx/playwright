# Talker Bloc Logger Flutter Package

The **talker_bloc_logger** package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who want to enhance their application's logging capabilities, particularly when using the BLoC (Business Logic Component) architecture. This package provides a way to log events, errors, and state changes in a structured manner, making it easier to debug and monitor the application's behavior.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the **talker_bloc_logger** package in scenarios such as:

- **Debugging**: When you need to track the flow of events and state changes in your BLoC architecture.
- **Error Tracking**: To log errors and exceptions that occur within your application, providing insights into issues that may arise during runtime.
- **Analytics**: To gather data on user interactions and application performance, which can be useful for improving user experience.

## Features

- **Structured Logging**: Logs are structured, making it easier to filter and analyze them.
- **Integration with BLoC**: Seamlessly integrates with the BLoC pattern, allowing you to log events and state changes directly from your BLoC classes.
- **Customizable**: You can customize the logging behavior to suit your application's needs, including log levels and output formats.

Overall, the **talker_bloc_logger** package is an essential tool for any Flutter developer looking to implement robust logging in their applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Talker Bloc Logger

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **talker_bloc_logger** package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **talker_bloc_logger** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  talker_bloc_logger: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/talker_bloc_logger).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you plan to log sensitive information. However, basic logging does not require any special permissions.

## Step 3: Using the Package

To use the **talker_bloc_logger** package, you need to initialize it in your main application file. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:talker_bloc_logger/talker_bloc_logger.dart';
```

2. Initialize the logger in your `main` function:

```dart
void main() {
  TalkerBlocLogger.init();
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

3. Use the logger in your BLoC classes to log events and state changes:

```dart
class RealFlutterBloc extends Bloc<RealFlutterEvent, RealFlutterState> {
  @override
  RealFlutterState get initialState => InitialRealFlutterState();

  @override
  Stream<RealFlutterState> mapEventToState(RealFlutterEvent event) async* {
    // Log the incoming event
    TalkerBlocLogger.log(event.toString());

    // Handle the event and yield new states
    if (event is SomeEvent) {
      yield SomeState();
    }
  }
}
```

With these steps, you have successfully set up and started using the **talker_bloc_logger** package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using Talker Bloc Logger

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_bloc/flutter_bloc.dart';
import 'package:talker_bloc_logger/talker_bloc_logger.dart';

// Define the events for the BLoC
abstract class RealFlutterEvent {}

class SomeEvent extends RealFlutterEvent {}

// Define the states for the BLoC
abstract class RealFlutterState {}

class InitialRealFlutterState extends RealFlutterState {}

class SomeState extends RealFlutterState {}

// Create the BLoC class
class RealFlutterBloc extends Bloc<RealFlutterEvent, RealFlutterState> {
  // Initialize the BLoC with the initial state
  RealFlutterBloc() : super(InitialRealFlutterState());

  @override
  Stream<RealFlutterState> mapEventToState(RealFlutterEvent event) async* {
    // Log the incoming event
    TalkerBlocLogger.log(event.toString());

    // Handle the event and yield new states
    if (event is SomeEvent) {
      yield SomeState();
    }
  }
}

// Main application widget
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Talker Bloc Logger Example',
      home: BlocProvider(
        create: (context) => RealFlutterBloc(),
        child: HomeScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Home screen widget
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Talker Bloc Logger Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Dispatch an event when the button is pressed
            context.read<RealFlutterBloc>().add(SomeEvent());
          },
          child: Text('Trigger Event'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Main function to run the app
void main() {
  TalkerBlocLogger.init(); // Initialize the logger
  runApp(MyApp()); // Run the application
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main function, where the TalkerBlocLogger is initialized.
2. The MyApp widget is created, which sets up the BlocProvider for the RealFlutterBloc.
3. The HomeScreen widget is displayed, containing a button.
4. When the button is pressed, a SomeEvent is dispatched to the RealFlutterBloc.
5. The BLoC logs the event using TalkerBlocLogger and processes it, yielding a new state (SomeState).
6. The application can be further extended to handle more events and states as needed.
