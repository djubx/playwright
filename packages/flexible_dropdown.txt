# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Flexible Dropdown Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the **flexible_dropdown** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flexible_dropdown: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flexible_dropdown/flexible_dropdown.dart';
```

## Step 4: Basic Usage

Hereâ€™s how to implement a basic dropdown in your Flutter application:

```dart
FlexibleDropdown(
  items: ['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3'],
  onChanged: (value) {
    // Handle the selected value
  },
)
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` to allow for any necessary permissions, especially if your dropdown interacts with location or other sensitive data.

## Step 5: Customizing the Dropdown

You can customize the dropdown by providing additional parameters such as `icon`, `hint`, and `isMultiSelect`:

```dart
FlexibleDropdown(
  items: ['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3'],
  hint: 'Select an item',
  icon: Icon(Icons.arrow_drop_down),
  isMultiSelect: true,
  onChanged: (value) {
    // Handle the selected values
  },
)
```

This setup allows you to create a dropdown that fits your app's design and functionality needs.

# Complete Example of Using Flexible Dropdown

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flexible_dropdown/flexible_dropdown.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flexible Dropdown Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flexible Dropdown Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: DropdownExample(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DropdownExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DropdownExampleState createState() => _DropdownExampleState();
}

class _DropdownExampleState extends State<DropdownExample> {
  // Variable to hold selected values
  List<String> selectedItems = [];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        // FlexibleDropdown widget
        FlexibleDropdown(
          items: ['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3', 'Item 4'],
          hint: 'Select items',
          icon: Icon(Icons.arrow_drop_down),
          isMultiSelect: true, // Enable multi-select
          onChanged: (value) {
            // Update the selected items
            setState(() {
              selectedItems = value;
            });
          },
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20),
        // Display selected items
        Text('Selected: ${selectedItems.join(', ')}'),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets up the MaterialApp widget.
// 2. MyApp is the root widget that contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 3. The body contains a DropdownExample widget, which is a stateful widget.
// 4. In the _DropdownExampleState, we define a list to hold selected items.
// 5. The FlexibleDropdown widget is created with a list of items, a hint, and an icon.
// 6. The onChanged callback updates the selectedItems list whenever the user selects or deselects items.
// 7. The selected items are displayed below the dropdown, updating in real-time as the user interacts with the dropdown.
```
