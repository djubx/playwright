## Setup Process

To get started with the `material3_layout` package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the `material3_layout` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  material3_layout: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

### Step 2: Install Packages

Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android

1. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add the necessary permissions in the `AndroidManifest.xml` if your app requires them.

#### iOS

1. Open the `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and ensure that you have the necessary configurations for your app.

2. If you are using any specific features that require permissions, make sure to add them to the `Info.plist`.

### Step 4: Import the Package

In your Dart files, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:material3_layout/material3_layout.dart';
```

## Using the Package

Once you have set up the package, you can start using its features. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a responsive layout using `material3_layout`:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:material3_layout/material3_layout.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Material 3 Layout Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        useMaterial3: true, // Enable Material 3
      ),
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Material 3 Layout'),
        ),
        body: ResponsiveLayout(
          mobile: MobileLayout(),
          tablet: TabletLayout(),
          desktop: DesktopLayout(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MobileLayout extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(child: Text('Mobile Layout'));
  }
}

class TabletLayout extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(child: Text('Tablet Layout'));
  }
}

class DesktopLayout extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(child: Text('Desktop Layout'));
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a `ResponsiveLayout` that adapts to different screen sizes by displaying different layouts for mobile, tablet, and desktop.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:material3_layout/material3_layout.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Material 3 Layout Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        useMaterial3: true, // Enable Material 3 theme
      ),
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Material 3 Layout'), // Title of the app
        ),
        body: ResponsiveLayout(
          mobile: MobileLayout(), // Layout for mobile devices
          tablet: TabletLayout(), // Layout for tablet devices
          desktop: DesktopLayout(), // Layout for desktop devices
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Mobile layout widget
class MobileLayout extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(child: Text('Mobile Layout')); // Centered text for mobile
  }
}

// Tablet layout widget
class TabletLayout extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(child: Text('Tablet Layout')); // Centered text for tablet
  }
}

// Desktop layout widget
class DesktopLayout extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(child: Text('Desktop Layout')); // Centered text for desktop
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The MaterialApp uses a Material 3 theme.
// 3. The home of the app is a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body contains a ResponsiveLayout widget that determines which layout to show based on the screen size.
// 5. Depending on the device type (mobile, tablet, or desktop), the corresponding layout widget is displayed.
// 6. Each layout widget (MobileLayout, TabletLayout, DesktopLayout) contains a simple centered text indicating the layout type.
```

In summary, the `material3_layout` package provides a robust solution for implementing responsive and adaptive layouts in Flutter applications. By following the setup and usage instructions, developers can easily create applications that adhere to Material Design 3 principles, ensuring a modern and user-friendly experience across various devices.
