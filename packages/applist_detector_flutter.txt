# AppList Detector Flutter Package

The `applist_detector_flutter` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that allows you to detect and manage the list of installed applications on a device. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to check for the presence of specific applications, such as for deep linking, app recommendations, or simply to enhance user experience by providing contextual actions based on installed apps.

## When to Use This Package
- **Deep Linking**: To check if a specific app is installed before attempting to open it.
- **App Recommendations**: To suggest users install certain apps based on their current app usage.
- **User Experience**: To provide tailored experiences based on the apps a user has installed.

## Features
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that allows for quick implementation.
- **Real-time Detection**: Detects installed applications in real-time, providing up-to-date information.

Overall, `applist_detector_flutter` is an essential package for developers looking to enhance their Flutter applications with app detection capabilities.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using AppList Detector Flutter

## Installation
To get started with the `applist_detector_flutter` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  applist_detector_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/applist_detector_flutter).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions to allow the app to access installed applications:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, no additional configuration is required. However, ensure that your app's deployment target is set to at least iOS 9.0.

## Using the Package
Once you have installed the package and configured your project, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to detect installed applications.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:applist_detector_flutter/applist_detector_flutter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  List<String> installedApps = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _getInstalledApps();
  }

  Future<void> _getInstalledApps() async {
    // Fetch the list of installed applications
    List<String> apps = await AppListDetectorFlutter.getInstalledApps();
    setState(() {
      installedApps = apps;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Installed Apps')),
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: installedApps.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return ListTile(
            title: Text(installedApps[index]),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that lists all installed applications on the device. The `_getInstalledApps` method fetches the installed apps and updates the state to display them in a `ListView`.

# Complete Example of AppList Detector Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:applist_detector_flutter/applist_detector_flutter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // List to hold the names of installed applications
  List<String> installedApps = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Call the method to get installed apps when the widget is initialized
    _getInstalledApps();
  }

  // Method to fetch the list of installed applications
  Future<void> _getInstalledApps() async {
    // Fetch the list of installed applications
    List<String> apps = await AppListDetectorFlutter.getInstalledApps();
    setState(() {
      // Update the state with the fetched list of apps
      installedApps = apps;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Installed Apps')),
      body: ListView.builder(
        // Build a list view to display the installed applications
        itemCount: installedApps.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return ListTile(
            // Display each installed app in a list tile
            title: Text(installedApps[index]),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The main function to run the Flutter application
void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    home: RealFlutter(),
  ));
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the MaterialApp.
2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which is a StatefulWidget.
3. In the _RealFlutterState class, the initState method is called when the widget is initialized.
4. The _getInstalledApps method is called to fetch the list of installed applications.
5. The fetched list is stored in the installedApps variable and the UI is updated using setState.
6. The build method constructs a Scaffold with an AppBar and a ListView to display the installed applications.
7. Each installed application is displayed as a ListTile in the ListView.
