# Tutorial: Setting Up We Slide

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **we_slide** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the **we_slide** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  we_slide: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install Packages

Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # Ensure this is set to at least 10.0
```

## Step 4: Basic Usage

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple example to demonstrate its usage.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:we_slide/we_slide.dart';
```

2. Create a basic sliding panel using the `WeSlide` widget:

```dart
WeSlide(
  children: [
    Container(color: Colors.red, child: Center(child: Text('Slide 1'))),
    Container(color: Colors.green, child: Center(child: Text('Slide 2'))),
    Container(color: Colors.blue, child: Center(child: Text('Slide 3'))),
  ],
)
```

This code creates a simple sliding panel with three colored slides.

## Step 5: Customization

You can customize the sliding behavior and appearance by modifying properties such as `duration`, `curve`, and `onPageChanged`. Refer to the package documentation for more details on available options.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the **we_slide** package into your Flutter application successfully.

# Complete Example of We Slide

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:we_slide/we_slide.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'We Slide Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('We Slide Example'),
      ),
      body: WeSlide(
        // The WeSlide widget allows for swipeable views
        children: [
          // First slide with a red background
          Container(
            color: Colors.red,
            child: Center(
              child: Text(
                'Slide 1',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.white),
              ),
            ),
          ),
          // Second slide with a green background
          Container(
            color: Colors.green,
            child: Center(
              child: Text(
                'Slide 2',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.white),
              ),
            ),
          ),
          // Third slide with a blue background
          Container(
            color: Colors.blue,
            child: Center(
              child: Text(
                'Slide 3',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.white),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ],
        // Optional: Customize the transition duration and curve
        duration: Duration(milliseconds: 300),
        curve: Curves.easeInOut,
        onPageChanged: (index) {
          // Callback when the page changes
          print('Current slide index: $index');
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a WeSlide widget as the body.
// 4. The WeSlide widget contains three slides, each represented by a Container with a different background color and centered text.
// 5. The WeSlide widget also includes optional properties for duration and curve, enhancing the sliding effect.
// 6. The onPageChanged callback prints the current slide index to the console whenever the user swipes to a new slide.
```
