# Complete Example of Curved Navigation Rail

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:curved_navigation_rail/curved_navigation_rail.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to keep track of the selected index
  int _selectedIndex = 0;

  // List of pages to navigate to
  final List<Widget> _pages = [
    Center(child: Text('Home Page')),
    Center(child: Text('Search Page')),
    Center(child: Text('Profile Page')),
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: _pages[_selectedIndex], // Display the selected page
        bottomNavigationBar: CurvedNavigationRail(
          // Set the current index
          selectedIndex: _selectedIndex,
          // Callback for when an item is tapped
          onDestinationSelected: (int index) {
            setState(() {
              _selectedIndex = index; // Update the selected index
            });
          },
          // Define the destinations (navigation items)
          destinations: const <NavigationRailDestination>[
            NavigationRailDestination(
              icon: Icon(Icons.home),
              selectedIcon: Icon(Icons.home_filled),
              label: Text('Home'),
            ),
            NavigationRailDestination(
              icon: Icon(Icons.search),
              selectedIcon: Icon(Icons.search),
              label: Text('Search'),
            ),
            NavigationRailDestination(
              icon: Icon(Icons.person),
              selectedIcon: Icon(Icons.person_outline),
              label: Text('Profile'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the selected index.
// 3. The _pages list contains three different pages to navigate to: Home, Search, and Profile.
// 4. The build method returns a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold displays the currently selected page based on _selectedIndex.
// 6. The CurvedNavigationRail widget is used as the bottom navigation bar.
// 7. The selectedIndex property is set to _selectedIndex, and onDestinationSelected updates the state when a destination is tapped.
// 8. Each destination is defined with an icon and label, providing a clear navigation structure for the user.
