# Setting Up Iconsax
To use Iconsax in your Flutter app, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Pubspec File
Add the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  iconsax: ^0.0.1
```
Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package
Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:iconsax/iconsax.dart';
```
### Step 3: Use the Icons
Use the icons in your app:
```dart
Icon(Iconsax.home)
```
### Platform-Specific Details
Iconsax works on both Android and iOS platforms. However, you may need to adjust the icon size and color to match your app's design.

### Configurations and Optimizations
You can configure the icon size and color using the `size` and `color` properties:
```dart
Icon(Iconsax.home, size: 24, color: Colors.blue)
```

        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Use the Iconsax icon
              Icon(Iconsax.home, size: 48, color: Colors.blue),
              SizedBox(height: 16),
              // Use the Iconsax icon with a different size and color
              Icon(Iconsax.settings, size: 24, color: Colors.red),
              SizedBox(height: 16),
              // Use the Iconsax icon with a different size and color
              Icon(Iconsax.user, size: 36, color: Colors.green),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app, and the `RealFlutter` widget is rendered.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` widget returns a `MaterialApp` widget with a `Scaffold` widget as its child.
// 3. The `Scaffold` widget has an `AppBar` widget with a title, and a `Center` widget as its body.
// 4. The `Center` widget has a `Column` widget as its child, which contains three `Icon` widgets.
// 5. Each `Icon` widget uses an Iconsax icon with a different size and color.
// 6. The user can see the three icons rendered on the screen.
