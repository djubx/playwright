```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:constrained_scrollable_views/constrained_scrollable_views.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Constrained Scrollable Views Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Constrained Scrollable Views Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ConstrainedScrollableView(
          // Specify the maximum height and width of the scrollable area
          maxHeight: 200,
          maxWidth: 300,
          // Specify the scroll direction (vertical or horizontal)
          axis: Axis.vertical,
          // Create a list of widgets to display in the scrollable area
          children: List.generate(
            20,
            (index) => ListTile(
              title: Text('Item $index'),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a scrollable area.
// 2. The scrollable area is constrained to a maximum height and width.
// 3. The user can scroll through the list of widgets in the scrollable area.
// 4. The scroll direction is determined by the axis property (vertical or horizontal).
```

// In summary, this code creates a scrollable area with a constrained height and width, allowing the user to scroll through a list of widgets in the specified direction.
