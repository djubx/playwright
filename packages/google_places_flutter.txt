# Tutorial: Setting Up Google Places Flutter Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `google_places_flutter` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `google_places_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  google_places_flutter: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Obtain API Key

You need to obtain an API key from the Google Cloud Console. Follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create a new project or select an existing one.
3. Navigate to the "APIs & Services" section and enable the "Places API".
4. Create credentials (API key) for your project.

## Step 3: Configure Android

For Android, you need to add your API key to the `AndroidManifest.xml` file. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following inside the `<application>` tag:

```xml
<meta-data
    android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
    android:value="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"/>
```

## Step 4: Configure iOS

For iOS, you need to add your API key to the `Info.plist` file. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>GMSApiKey</key>
<string>YOUR_API_KEY_HERE</string>
```

## Step 5: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the Google Places Autocomplete feature.

# Complete Example: Google Places Flutter Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:google_places_flutter/google_places_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Google Places Flutter Example',
      home: PlacesSearchScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PlacesSearchScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PlacesSearchScreenState createState() => _PlacesSearchScreenState();
}

class _PlacesSearchScreenState extends State<PlacesSearchScreen> {
  // Controller for the text field
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController();
  // List to hold the suggestions
  List<Place> _places = [];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Google Places Search'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            // Text field for user input
            TextField(
              controller: _controller,
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                hintText: 'Search for places...',
                suffixIcon: IconButton(
                  icon: Icon(Icons.clear),
                  onPressed: () {
                    _controller.clear(); // Clear the text field
                    setState(() {
                      _places.clear(); // Clear the suggestions
                    });
                  },
                ),
              ),
              onChanged: (value) {
                // Call the autocomplete function when the text changes
                if (value.isNotEmpty) {
                  _fetchPlaces(value);
                } else {
                  setState(() {
                    _places.clear(); // Clear suggestions if input is empty
                  });
                }
              },
            ),
            // Display the list of places
            Expanded(
              child: ListView.builder(
                itemCount: _places.length,
                itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                  return ListTile(
                    title: Text(_places[index].description),
                    onTap: () {
                      // Handle place selection
                      _controller.text = _places[index].description;
                      setState(() {
                        _places.clear(); // Clear suggestions after selection
                      });
                    },
                  );
                },
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to fetch places based on user input
  void _fetchPlaces(String query) async {
    // Call the Google Places API to get autocomplete suggestions
    final places = await GooglePlacesAutocomplete.getPlacePredictions(
      input: query,
      apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE', // Replace with your API key
    );

    setState(() {
      _places = places; // Update the suggestions list
    });
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The PlacesSearchScreen widget contains a text field for user input and a list to display suggestions.
// 4. When the user types in the text field, the onChanged callback triggers the _fetchPlaces function.
// 5. The _fetchPlaces function calls the Google Places API to get autocomplete suggestions based on the input.
// 6. The suggestions are displayed in a ListView, and when a user taps on a suggestion, it populates the text field and clears the suggestions.
```

// Final Summary:
// The application allows users to search for places using the Google Places API. It starts with a text field where users can type their queries. As they type, the app fetches autocomplete suggestions from the API and displays them in a list. When a user selects a suggestion, it populates the text field with the selected place and clears the suggestions. This flow provides a seamless user experience for searching and selecting places.
