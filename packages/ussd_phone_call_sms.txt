# Tutorial
==========

## Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

Add the `ussd_phone_call_sms` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ussd_phone_call_sms: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to get the package.

## Step 2: Import the Package

Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:ussd_phone_call_sms/ussd_phone_call_sms.dart';
```

## Step 3: Make a USSD Request

To make a USSD request, use the `makeUssdRequest` method:

```dart
UssdPhoneCallSms.makeUssdRequest('your_ussd_code', context);
```

Replace `'your_ussd_code'` with your actual USSD code.

## Step 4: Make a Phone Call

To make a phone call, use the `makePhoneCall` method:

```dart
UssdPhoneCallSms.makePhoneCall('phone_number', context);
```

Replace `'phone_number'` with the actual phone number you want to call.

## Step 5: Send an SMS Message

To send an SMS message, use the `sendSms` method:

```dart
UssdPhoneCallSms.sendSms('phone_number', 'message', context);
```

Replace `'phone_number'` with the actual phone number you want to send the message to, and `'message'` with the actual message you want to send.

### Platform-Specific Details

*   **Android:** This package uses the `android.intent.action.CALL` intent to make phone calls and the `android.intent.action.SENDTO` intent to send SMS messages.
*   **iOS:** This package uses the `URL` class to make phone calls and send SMS messages.

### Required Configurations or Optimizations

*   **Android:** Add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

    ```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CALL_PHONE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SEND_SMS" />
```

*   **iOS:** Add the following lines to your `Info.plist` file:

    ```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>

// The app starts by running the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// The MyApp widget builds the MaterialApp, which is the root widget of the app.
// The MaterialApp has a title, a theme, and a home widget, which is the MyHomePage widget.
// The MyHomePage widget is a stateful widget that builds the Scaffold, which is the basic material design visual layout structure.
// The Scaffold has an AppBar, a body, and a floatingActionButton.
// The body is a Center widget that contains a Column widget, which contains three ElevatedButton widgets.
// Each ElevatedButton widget has an onPressed property that calls a function when the button is pressed.
// The functions called by the ElevatedButton widgets make a USSD request, make a phone call, and send an SMS message, respectively.
// The context is passed to the functions to provide information about the app's environment.
