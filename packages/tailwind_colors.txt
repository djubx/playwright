# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Tailwind Colors

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started with the **tailwind_colors** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  tailwind_colors: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install Packages

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart files where you want to use the Tailwind colors, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:tailwind_colors/tailwind_colors.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using Tailwind Colors

You can now use the Tailwind colors in your Flutter widgets. Here’s how you can apply it in a simple Flutter app:

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, make sure your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 5: Example Usage

Here’s a simple example of how to use the Tailwind colors in a Flutter application:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tailwind_colors/tailwind_colors.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Tailwind Colors Example'),
          backgroundColor: TailwindColors.green[500], // Using Tailwind's green color
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Container(
            color: TailwindColors.red[300], // Using Tailwind's red color
            padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
            child: Text(
              'Hello, Tailwind!',
              style: TextStyle(color: TailwindColors.white), // Using Tailwind's white color
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to create a simple Flutter app that utilizes Tailwind colors for the app bar and body.

# Complete Example of Tailwind Colors in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tailwind_colors/tailwind_colors.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Start the app with the RealFlutter class
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Tailwind Colors Demo', // Title of the application
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Tailwind Colors Example'), // App bar title
          backgroundColor: TailwindColors.blue[600], // App bar color using Tailwind's blue
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Container(
            color: TailwindColors.yellow[300], // Container color using Tailwind's yellow
            padding: EdgeInsets.all(20), // Padding around the text
            child: Text(
              'Hello, Tailwind!', // Text displayed in the center
              style: TextStyle(
                color: TailwindColors.white, // Text color using Tailwind's white
                fontSize: 24, // Font size of the text
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the Flutter application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter class.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a title and a home property, which is a Scaffold widget.
// 4. The Scaffold widget provides an AppBar and a body.
// 5. The AppBar has a title and a background color defined using Tailwind's blue color.
// 6. The body contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 7. The child is a Container with a yellow background color and padding.
// 8. Inside the Container, there is a Text widget that displays "Hello, Tailwind!" with white color and a font size of 24.
