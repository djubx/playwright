# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Step Progress Indicator

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `step_progress_indicator` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  step_progress_indicator: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the step progress indicator, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:step_progress_indicator/step_progress_indicator.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Step Progress Indicator

You can now use the `StepProgressIndicator` widget in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
StepProgressIndicator(
  totalSteps: 5, // Total number of steps
  currentStep: 2, // Current step
  size: 36, // Size of the indicator
  selectedColor: Colors.blue, // Color for the completed steps
  unselectedColor: Colors.grey, // Color for the uncompleted steps
  roundedEdges: Radius.circular(10), // Rounded edges for the indicator
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

#### iOS

For iOS, make sure to enable the necessary permissions in your `Info.plist` if your app requires any specific capabilities.

## Step 4: Customization

You can customize the appearance of the `StepProgressIndicator` by adjusting its properties, such as `size`, `selectedColor`, `unselectedColor`, and `roundedEdges`. This allows you to match the indicator with your app's theme.

With these steps, you should be able to successfully integrate and use the `step_progress_indicator` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Step Progress Indicator

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:step_progress_indicator/step_progress_indicator.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Step Progress Indicator Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Step Progress Indicator'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: StepProgressIndicator(
            totalSteps: 5, // Total number of steps in the process
            currentStep: 3, // Current step the user is on
            size: 36, // Size of the indicator
            selectedColor: Colors.blue, // Color for completed steps
            unselectedColor: Colors.grey, // Color for uncompleted steps
            roundedEdges: Radius.circular(10), // Rounded edges for the indicator
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The above code creates a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the Step Progress Indicator.
// 
// 1. The `main` function initializes the app by calling `runApp` with the `RealFlutter` widget.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` class is a StatelessWidget that builds the main structure of the app.
// 3. Inside the `build` method, a MaterialApp is created with a title and a Scaffold.
// 4. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Step Progress Indicator".
// 5. The body of the Scaffold centers the StepProgressIndicator widget.
// 6. The StepProgressIndicator is configured with 5 total steps, indicating that the user is currently on step 3.
// 7. The appearance of the indicator is customized with specific colors and rounded edges.
// 
// This simple example effectively demonstrates how to implement and customize the Step Progress Indicator in a Flutter application.
