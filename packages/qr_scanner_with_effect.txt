# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the QR Scanner with Effect Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the `qr_scanner_with_effect` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  qr_scanner_with_effect: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
   ```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request camera access:
   ```xml
   <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your camera to scan QR codes.</string>
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the QR scanner.

# Complete Example of QR Scanner with Effect

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:qr_scanner_with_effect/qr_scanner_with_effect.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'QR Scanner with Effect',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: QRScannerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class QRScannerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _QRScannerScreenState createState() => _QRScannerScreenState();
}

class _QRScannerScreenState extends State<QRScannerScreen> {
  String result = "Scan a QR code";

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('QR Scanner'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(result), // Display the scanned result
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Start the QR scanner
                Navigator.push(
                  context,
                  MaterialPageRoute(
                    builder: (context) => QRScannerWithEffect(
                      onScan: (String scannedData) {
                        // Update the result with the scanned data
                        setState(() {
                          result = scannedData;
                        });
                        Navigator.pop(context); // Go back to the previous screen
                      },
                    ),
                  ),
                );
              },
              child: Text('Start Scanning'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home screen is set to QRScannerScreen, which contains the UI for scanning.
// 4. In QRScannerScreen, a button is provided to start the scanning process.
// 5. When the button is pressed, it navigates to the QRScannerWithEffect screen.
// 6. The QRScannerWithEffect widget handles the scanning and returns the scanned data.
// 7. The scanned data is displayed on the main screen after scanning is complete.
```
