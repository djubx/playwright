# Tutorial: Setting Up Easy Loader

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **easy_loader** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  easy_loader: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Basic Usage

### Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:easy_loader/easy_loader.dart';
```

### Using Easy Loader

You can use the **EasyLoader** widget in your application as follows:

```dart
EasyLoader.show(); // Show the loader
// Perform your async operation here
EasyLoader.dismiss(); // Dismiss the loader
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions if you are performing network operations. Typically, you need:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

#### iOS

For iOS, ensure that you have the correct configurations in your `Info.plist` file, especially if you are making network requests. You may need to add:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Customizing the Loader

You can customize the loader by passing parameters to the `EasyLoader` widget. For example:

```dart
EasyLoader.show(
  indicator: CircularProgressIndicator(), // Custom indicator
  backgroundColor: Colors.black54, // Background color
);
```

This allows you to tailor the loading experience to fit your app's design.

# Complete Example of Easy Loader

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:easy_loader/easy_loader.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Easy Loader Example',
      home: LoaderExample(),
    );
  }
}

class LoaderExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _LoaderExampleState createState() => _LoaderExampleState();
}

class _LoaderExampleState extends State<LoaderExample> {
  // This function simulates a network call
  Future<void> fetchData() async {
    EasyLoader.show(); // Show the loader
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3)); // Simulate a delay
    EasyLoader.dismiss(); // Dismiss the loader
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Easy Loader Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: fetchData, // Call fetchData on button press
          child: Text('Fetch Data'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget (LoaderExample).
// 3. LoaderExample is a stateful widget that contains a button to fetch data.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the fetchData function is called.
// 5. Inside fetchData, the EasyLoader is shown to indicate loading.
// 6. A simulated delay of 3 seconds is introduced to mimic a network call.
// 7. After the delay, the EasyLoader is dismissed, indicating that loading is complete.
```
