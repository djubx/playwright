# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the `image_capture_field` Package

## Installation
To get started with the `image_capture_field` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  image_capture_field: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/image_capture_field).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request camera access:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to capture images.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save images.</string>
```

## Using the Package
Once you have installed the package and configured the necessary permissions, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the image capture functionality.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:image_capture_field/image_capture_field.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Image Capture Example',
      home: ImageCaptureScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ImageCaptureScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ImageCaptureScreenState createState() => _ImageCaptureScreenState();
}

class _ImageCaptureScreenState extends State<ImageCaptureScreen> {
  // Variable to hold the captured image
  String? _imagePath;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Capture Image'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the captured image if available
            _imagePath != null
                ? Image.file(File(_imagePath!))
                : Text('No image captured.'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to capture image
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _captureImage,
              child: Text('Capture Image'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to capture image using the image_capture_field package
  Future<void> _captureImage() async {
    // Call the image capture method from the package
    final imagePath = await ImageCaptureField.captureImage();
    // Update the state with the captured image path
    setState(() {
      _imagePath = imagePath;
    });
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The ImageCaptureScreen widget is displayed, which contains a button to capture an image.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the _captureImage function is called.
// 5. The _captureImage function uses the image_capture_field package to capture an image.
// 6. Once the image is captured, the state is updated to display the image on the screen.
```
