# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using TypewriterText

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started with the TypewriterText package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  typewritertext: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the TypewriterText package:

```dart
import 'package:typewritertext/typewritertext.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using TypewriterText in Your Widget
You can now use the `TypewriterText` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
TypewriterText(
  'Hello, Flutter!',
  speed: Duration(milliseconds: 100), // Speed of typing
  textStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.blue), // Text styling
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details
- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid compatibility issues.
- **iOS**: No specific configurations are required, but ensure that your deployment target is set appropriately in `ios/Podfile`.

### Optimizations
- For better performance, especially with longer texts, consider using the `pause` feature to allow users to read before continuing.
- Test the typing speed on different devices to ensure a consistent experience.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the TypewriterText package into your Flutter application seamlessly.

# Complete Example of TypewriterText

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:typewritertext/typewritertext.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Typewriter Text Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Typewriter Text Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // TypewriterText widget displaying a message
              TypewriterText(
                'Welcome to the Typewriter Text Demo!',
                speed: Duration(milliseconds: 150), // Typing speed
                textStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, color: Colors.black), // Text style
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between texts
              TypewriterText(
                'Enjoy creating engaging text animations!',
                speed: Duration(milliseconds: 100), // Typing speed
                textStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 18, color: Colors.green), // Text style
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to stack the TypewriterText widgets vertically.
// 5. Each TypewriterText widget displays a message with a specified typing speed and text style.
// 6. The SizedBox provides spacing between the two TypewriterText widgets for better visual separation.
