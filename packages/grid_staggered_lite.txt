# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `grid_staggered_lite`

## Installation

To get started with `grid_staggered_lite`, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  grid_staggered_lite: ^0.3.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, make sure your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package

To use `grid_staggered_lite`, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:grid_staggered_lite/grid_staggered_lite.dart';
```

You can then create a staggered grid layout by using the `StaggeredGridView` widget. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
StaggeredGridView.countBuilder(
  crossAxisCount: 4, // Number of columns
  itemCount: items.length, // Total number of items
  itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int index) => Container(
    color: Colors.teal,
    child: Center(child: Text('Item $index')),
  ),
  staggeredTileBuilder: (int index) => StaggeredTile.fit(2), // Each item takes 2 columns
  mainAxisSpacing: 4.0, // Space between rows
  crossAxisSpacing: 4.0, // Space between columns
)
```

This code creates a staggered grid where each item occupies two columns, with specified spacing between items.

With this setup, you are ready to create beautiful staggered grid layouts in your Flutter applications!

# Complete Example of `grid_staggered_lite`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:grid_staggered_lite/grid_staggered_lite.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Grid Staggered Lite Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Staggered Grid Example'),
        ),
        body: StaggeredGridView.countBuilder(
          crossAxisCount: 4, // Number of columns in the grid
          itemCount: 8, // Total number of items to display
          itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int index) => Container(
            color: Colors.teal, // Background color of each item
            child: Center(
              child: Text(
                'Item $index', // Display item index
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
              ),
            ),
          ),
          staggeredTileBuilder: (int index) => StaggeredTile.fit(2), // Each item takes 2 columns
          mainAxisSpacing: 4.0, // Space between rows
          crossAxisSpacing: 4.0, // Space between columns
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Staggered Grid Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is a StaggeredGridView that arranges items in a staggered layout.
// 5. The grid has 4 columns, and a total of 8 items are displayed.
// 6. Each item is a Container with a teal background and centered text showing its index.
// 7. The staggeredTileBuilder defines that each item will take up 2 columns, creating a staggered effect.
// 8. Main and cross-axis spacing are set to 4.0 for visual separation between items.
