# Kartal Flutter Package

The **Kartal** package is a powerful utility for Flutter developers that enhances the development experience by providing a set of extensions and utilities that simplify common tasks. It is designed to promote clean architecture and improve code readability by offering a more structured way to manage state, dependencies, and UI components.

## When to Use Kartal

You might consider using the Kartal package in scenarios such as:
- When you want to implement a clean architecture in your Flutter application.
- If you need to manage state efficiently across your app.
- When you want to reduce boilerplate code and improve code maintainability.

## Key Features

- **Extension Methods**: Kartal provides a variety of extension methods that can be used to simplify common tasks, such as navigation, context management, and more.
- **Dependency Injection**: It supports dependency injection, making it easier to manage dependencies in your application.
- **State Management**: Kartal offers tools for effective state management, allowing you to build reactive applications with ease.
- **UI Components**: The package includes a set of reusable UI components that can help speed up the development process.

By leveraging these features, developers can create robust and maintainable Flutter applications with less effort.

# Setting Up the Kartal Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the Kartal package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding Kartal to Your Project

To get started, you need to add the Kartal package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  kartal: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/kartal).

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing Kartal

In your Dart files, import the Kartal package to start using its features:

```dart
import 'package:kartal/kartal.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using Kartal in Your Application

You can now use Kartal's features in your application. For example, you can utilize its extension methods to simplify your widget building and state management.

# Complete Example of Using Kartal

Below is a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the Kartal package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:kartal/kartal.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Using Kartal's context extension to set up the theme
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Kartal Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Using Kartal's context extension to get screen size
    final screenSize = context.screenSize;

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Kartal Package Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Screen Width: ${screenSize.width}',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Using Kartal's navigation extension to navigate to DetailPage
                context.navigateTo(DetailPage());
              },
              child: Text('Go to Detail Page'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DetailPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Detail Page'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'This is the Detail Page',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds the MaterialApp with a home page set to HomePage.
// 3. HomePage displays the screen width and a button to navigate to DetailPage.
// 4. When the button is pressed, it uses Kartal's navigation extension to push DetailPage onto the navigation stack.
// 5. DetailPage displays a simple message when navigated to.
```
