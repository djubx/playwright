# Simulate Flutter Package: A High-Level Overview
=====================================================

The `simulate` Flutter package is a powerful tool for simulating various scenarios in your Flutter applications. It allows you to test and debug your app's behavior in different situations, such as network connectivity changes, GPS location updates, and more.

### When to Use This Package

This package is particularly useful when you want to:

* Test your app's behavior in different network conditions (e.g., offline, slow internet, etc.)
* Simulate GPS location updates to test your app's location-based features
* Test your app's behavior when the device's battery level changes
* Simulate other scenarios that are difficult to reproduce in real-life testing

### Features

The `simulate` package provides a range of features, including:

* Network simulation: simulate different network conditions, such as offline, slow internet, etc.
* GPS location simulation: simulate GPS location updates to test your app's location-based features
* Battery level simulation: simulate changes to the device's battery level
* Custom simulation: create custom simulation scenarios using the package's API

# Setting Up and Using the Simulate Package
=============================================

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Pubspec.yaml File

Add the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  simulate: ^1.0.0
```
Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package in Your Dart File

Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:simulate/simulate.dart';
```
### Step 3: Create a Simulation Scenario

Create a simulation scenario using the package's API:
```dart
void main() {
  // Create a simulation scenario
  final simulation = Simulation(
    // Simulate offline network conditions
    network: NetworkSimulation.offline(),
    // Simulate a GPS location update
    location: LocationSimulation(
      latitude: 37.7749,
      longitude: -122.4194,
    ),
  );

  // Run the simulation
  simulation.run();
}
```
### Platform-Specific Details

* Android: You need to add the following permission to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
```
* iOS: You need to add the following key to your `Info.plist` file:
```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs access to your location to work properly</string>
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simulate/simulate.dart';

void main() {
  // Create a simulation scenario
  final simulation = Simulation(
    // Simulate offline network conditions
    network: NetworkSimulation.offline(),
    // Simulate a GPS location update
    location: LocationSimulation(
      latitude: 37.7749,
      longitude: -122.4194,
    ),
  );

  // Run the simulation
  simulation.run();

  // Create a Flutter app
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Simulate Package Demo',
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Simulate Package Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Simulation is running...'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The app flow is as follows:
// 1. The simulation scenario is created with offline network conditions and a GPS location update.
// 2. The simulation is run using the `run()` method.
// 3. The Flutter app is created and run using the `runApp()` function.
// 4. The app displays a text message indicating that the simulation is running.
// 5. The simulation continues to run in the background, simulating the specified conditions.
```

// In summary, this code creates a simulation scenario with offline network conditions and a GPS location update, runs the simulation, and displays a text message in a Flutter app indicating that the simulation is running. The simulation continues to run in the background, simulating the specified conditions.
