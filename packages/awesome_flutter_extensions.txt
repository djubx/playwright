# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Awesome Flutter Extensions

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **awesome_flutter_extensions** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  awesome_flutter_extensions: ^1.0.0
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the package to access its features:

```dart
import 'package:awesome_flutter_extensions/awesome_flutter_extensions.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Extensions

### Example for String Extensions

You can use string extensions to manipulate strings easily. For instance:

```dart
String myString = "  Hello, Flutter!  ";
String trimmed = myString.trim(); // "Hello, Flutter!"
```

### Example for List Extensions

List extensions allow you to perform operations like filtering:

```dart
List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
List<int> evenNumbers = numbers.where((number) => number.isEven).toList(); // [2, 4]
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

#### iOS

For iOS, make sure your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Optimizations

To optimize performance, consider using the extensions in a way that minimizes unnecessary computations. For example, avoid calling expensive operations in build methods and cache results when possible.

By following these steps, you can effectively integrate the **awesome_flutter_extensions** package into your Flutter applications, enhancing your development experience.

# Complete Example: Using Awesome Flutter Extensions

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:awesome_flutter_extensions/awesome_flutter_extensions.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Awesome Flutter Extensions Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Awesome Flutter Extensions'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Using String extension to display a formatted string
              Text(
                "  Hello, Flutter!  ".trim(), // Trimming whitespace
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Using List extension to filter even numbers
              Text(
                'Even Numbers: ${[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].where((n) => n.isEven).toList()}', // Filtering even numbers
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Using DateTime extension to display current date
              Text(
                'Current Date: ${DateTime.now().toFormattedString()}', // Formatting current date
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that centers its child widgets.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange multiple Text widgets vertically.
// 5. The first Text widget displays a trimmed string using the String extension.
// 6. The second Text widget shows a list of even numbers filtered from a list using the List extension.
// 7. The third Text widget displays the current date formatted using the DateTime extension.
// 8. Each Text widget is styled for better visibility and spaced using SizedBox.
```
