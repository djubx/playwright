## When to Use `ferry_hive_store`

You should consider using `ferry_hive_store` when:
- You need to manage GraphQL data in your Flutter application.
- You want to provide offline capabilities by caching data locally.
- You are already using Hive for local storage and want to integrate it with your GraphQL operations.

## Key Features
- **GraphQL Integration**: Easily manage GraphQL queries and mutations.
- **Local Storage**: Leverage Hive for efficient local data storage.
- **Offline Support**: Automatically cache data for offline access.
- **Reactive Updates**: Automatically update UI components when data changes.

# Setting Up and Using `ferry_hive_store`

## Installation

To get started with `ferry_hive_store`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ferry_hive_store: ^latest_version
  hive: ^latest_version
  hive_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version numbers available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following configurations:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
}
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions if you are accessing the internet:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage

1. **Initialize Hive**: Before using `ferry_hive_store`, you need to initialize Hive in your `main.dart` file.

```dart
void main() async {
  await Hive.initFlutter();
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

2. **Create a GraphQL Client**: Set up your GraphQL client and integrate it with Hive.

```dart
final client = Client(
  link: HttpLink('https://your-graphql-endpoint.com/graphql'),
  cache: HiveStore(),
);
```

3. **Using the Store**: You can now use the `ferry_hive_store` to perform queries and mutations.

```dart
final query = YourQuery();
final response = await client.request(query).first;
```

This setup allows you to manage your GraphQL data with local storage capabilities seamlessly.

# Complete Example of Using `ferry_hive_store`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ferry/ferry.dart';
import 'package:ferry_hive_store/ferry_hive_store.dart';
import 'package:hive_flutter/hive_flutter.dart';

void main() async {
  // Initialize Hive for local storage
  await Hive.initFlutter();
  
  // Create a Hive store for caching GraphQL data
  final hiveStore = HiveStore();
  
  // Create a GraphQL client with the Hive store
  final client = Client(
    link: HttpLink('https://your-graphql-endpoint.com/graphql'),
    cache: hiveStore,
  );

  // Run the Flutter app
  runApp(MyApp(client: client));
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  final Client client;

  MyApp({required this.client});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Ferry Hive Store Example',
      home: HomeScreen(client: client),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final Client client;

  HomeScreen({required this.client});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Ferry Hive Store Example')),
      body: FutureBuilder(
        // Perform a GraphQL query
        future: client.request(YourQuery()).first,
        builder: (context, snapshot) {
          if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
            return Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
          } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
            return Center(child: Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}'));
          }

          // Display the data from the query
          final data = snapshot.data;
          return ListView.builder(
            itemCount: data.items.length,
            itemBuilder: (context, index) {
              return ListTile(
                title: Text(data.items[index].title),
              );
            },
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes Hive and creates a GraphQL client with the Hive store.
// 2. The MyApp widget is created, passing the GraphQL client to the HomeScreen.
// 3. In HomeScreen, a FutureBuilder is used to perform a GraphQL query.
// 4. While waiting for the data, a loading indicator is shown.
// 5. Once the data is received, it is displayed in a ListView.
// 6. If an error occurs during the query, an error message is displayed.
