// Application flow:
// 1. The user opens the app and the Pusher client is initialized.
// 2. The user subscribes to a channel and binds an event listener.
// 3. When the user sends a message, the `trigger` method is called to send the message to the channel.
// 4. The event listener receives the message and prints it to the console.
// 5. The user can receive real-time updates from other users who are also subscribed to the same channel.

// Final summary:
// The Pusher Channels Flutter package provides a simple and efficient way to add real-time functionality to your Flutter app.
// By initializing the Pusher client, subscribing to a channel, and binding an event listener, you can receive real-time updates and send messages to other users.
// The package handles connection settings, error handling, and logging, making it easy to integrate into your existing infrastructure.
