# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Pusher Channels Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **pusher_channels** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **pusher_channels** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  pusher_channels: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/pusher_channels).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       compileOptions {
           sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
           targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open `ios/Podfile` and uncomment the platform line to ensure compatibility:
   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

2. Run `pod install` in the `ios` directory to install the necessary dependencies.

## Step 3: Initialize Pusher in Your App

In your main Dart file, you will need to initialize Pusher and set up event listeners. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pusher_channels/pusher_channels.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Pusher Channels Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late PusherChannels _pusher;
  String _message = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _initializePusher();
  }

  void _initializePusher() {
    // Initialize Pusher with your app key and cluster
    _pusher = PusherChannels(
      appKey: 'YOUR_APP_KEY',
      cluster: 'YOUR_APP_CLUSTER',
    );

    // Subscribe to a channel
    _pusher.subscribe('my-channel');

    // Bind to an event
    _pusher.bind('my-event', (data) {
      setState(() {
        _message = data['message'];
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Pusher Channels Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Latest Message: $_message'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Pusher Channels in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pusher_channels/pusher_channels.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Pusher Channels Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late PusherChannels _pusher; // Declare a PusherChannels instance
  String _message = ''; // Variable to hold the latest message

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _initializePusher(); // Initialize Pusher when the widget is created
  }

  void _initializePusher() {
    // Initialize Pusher with your app key and cluster
    _pusher = PusherChannels(
      appKey: 'YOUR_APP_KEY', // Replace with your Pusher app key
      cluster: 'YOUR_APP_CLUSTER', // Replace with your Pusher app cluster
    );

    // Subscribe to a channel
    _pusher.subscribe('my-channel'); // Subscribe to 'my-channel'

    // Bind to an event
    _pusher.bind('my-event', (data) {
      setState(() {
        _message = data['message']; // Update the message when an event is received
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Pusher Channels Example'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Latest Message: $_message'), // Display the latest message
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds the MaterialApp and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. In RealFlutter, the state is initialized, and Pusher is set up in initState.
// 4. The _initializePusher method initializes the Pusher instance with the app key and cluster.
// 5. It subscribes to 'my-channel' and binds to 'my-event' to listen for incoming messages.
// 6. When a message is received, the state is updated, and the UI reflects the latest message.
// 7. The latest message is displayed in the center of the screen.
