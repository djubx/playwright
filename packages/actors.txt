# Actors Flutter Package: A High-Level Overview
=====================================================

The Actors package is a powerful tool for managing concurrent and parallel tasks in Flutter applications. It provides a simple and efficient way to handle complex asynchronous operations, making it an ideal choice for developers who want to build scalable and responsive apps.

### When to Use Actors

Actors are particularly useful when dealing with tasks that require concurrent execution, such as:

* Handling multiple network requests simultaneously
* Performing computationally intensive operations, like image processing or data compression
* Updating the UI in real-time while performing background tasks

### Key Features

The Actors package offers several key features that make it an attractive choice for Flutter developers:

* **Lightweight and efficient**: Actors are designed to be lightweight and efficient, making them suitable for use in mobile applications where resources are limited.
* **Easy to use**: The Actors package provides a simple and intuitive API that makes it easy to create and manage actors.
* **Support for concurrent and parallel execution**: Actors can be executed concurrently or in parallel, making it easy to handle complex asynchronous operations.

# Setting Up and Using the Actors Package
=============================================

### Step 1: Add the Actors Package to Your Project

To use the Actors package, you need to add it to your project's `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  actors: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Create an Actor

To create an actor, you need to extend the `Actor` class and override the `execute` method:

```dart
import 'package:actors/actors.dart';

class RealFlutter extends Actor {
  @override
  Future<void> execute(ActorContext context) async {
    // Execute some code here
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Create an Actor System

To create an actor system, you need to create an instance of the `ActorSystem` class:

```dart
import 'package:actors/actors.dart';

void main() {
  final actorSystem = ActorSystem();
  // Create actors and execute them here
}
```

### Platform-Specific Details

The Actors package works on both Android and iOS platforms. However, there are some platform-specific details to keep in mind:

* **Android**: On Android, actors are executed on a background thread by default. If you want to execute actors on the main thread, you need to use the `executeOnMainThread` method.
* **iOS**: On iOS, actors are executed on the main thread by default. If you want to execute actors on a background thread, you need to use the `executeOnBackgroundThread` method.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:actors/actors.dart';

void main() {
  final actorSystem = ActorSystem();

  // Create an actor
  final actor = RealFlutter();

  // Execute the actor
  actorSystem.execute(actor);
}

class RealFlutter extends Actor {
  @override
  Future<void> execute(ActorContext context) async {
    // Step 1: Print a message to the console
    print('Hello, World!');

    // Step 2: Wait for 2 seconds
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));

    // Step 3: Print another message to the console
    print('Hello, World! Again!');
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The main function is executed, which creates an actor system.
// 2. The actor system executes the RealFlutter actor.
// 3. The RealFlutter actor prints a message to the console.
// 4. The RealFlutter actor waits for 2 seconds.
// 5. The RealFlutter actor prints another message to the console.
// The application flow is asynchronous and non-blocking, allowing for concurrent execution of actors.

// Final summary: The code demonstrates the use of the Actors package to execute asynchronous and concurrent tasks in a Flutter application. The RealFlutter actor is executed by the actor system, which prints messages to the console and waits for a specified duration.
