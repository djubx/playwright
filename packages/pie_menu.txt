# Tutorial

## Setup Process

To get started with the `pie_menu` package, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `pie_menu` package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     pie_menu: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
   ```

2. **Install the Package**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

     ```groovy
     android {
         ...
         defaultConfig {
             ...
             minSdkVersion 21
         }
     }
     ```

   - **iOS**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and ensure you have the necessary permissions if your app requires them (e.g., for accessing the camera or location).

4. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the package:

   ```dart
   import 'package:pie_menu/pie_menu.dart';
   ```

## Using the Package

To create a pie menu, you can use the `PieMenu` widget provided by the package. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pie_menu/pie_menu.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Pie Menu Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: PieMenu(
            items: [
              PieMenuItem(
                icon: Icons.home,
                label: 'Home',
                onTap: () {
                  // Handle Home action
                },
              ),
              PieMenuItem(
                icon: Icons.settings,
                label: 'Settings',
                onTap: () {
                  // Handle Settings action
                },
              ),
              PieMenuItem(
                icon: Icons.info,
                label: 'About',
                onTap: () {
                  // Handle About action
                },
              ),
            ],
            onMenuOpen: () {
              // Handle menu open
            },
            onMenuClose: () {
              // Handle menu close
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic pie menu with three options: Home, Settings, and About. Each option has an icon and a label, and you can define actions for each tap.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pie_menu/pie_menu.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Pie Menu Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: PieMenu(
            items: [
              PieMenuItem(
                icon: Icons.home,
                label: 'Home',
                onTap: () {
                  // Handle Home action
                  print('Home tapped');
                },
              ),
              PieMenuItem(
                icon: Icons.settings,
                label: 'Settings',
                onTap: () {
                  // Handle Settings action
                  print('Settings tapped');
                },
              ),
              PieMenuItem(
                icon: Icons.info,
                label: 'About',
                onTap: () {
                  // Handle About action
                  print('About tapped');
                },
              ),
            ],
            onMenuOpen: () {
              // Handle menu open
              print('Menu opened');
            },
            onMenuClose: () {
              // Handle menu close
              print('Menu closed');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, a PieMenu is created with three PieMenuItems: Home, Settings, and About.
// 4. Each PieMenuItem has an icon and a label, and an onTap callback that prints a message to the console when tapped.
// 5. The PieMenu also has onMenuOpen and onMenuClose callbacks to handle actions when the menu is opened or closed.
// 6. When the user taps on a segment of the pie menu, the corresponding action is executed, providing a responsive user experience.
