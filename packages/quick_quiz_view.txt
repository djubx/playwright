# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Quick Quiz View

## Installation
To add the `quick_quiz_view` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  quick_quiz_view: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/quick_quiz_view).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package
To use the `quick_quiz_view` package, you need to create a quiz model and then display it using the `QuickQuizView` widget. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:quick_quiz_view/quick_quiz_view.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Quick Quiz Example')),
        body: QuickQuizView(
          questions: [
            Question(
              questionText: 'What is the capital of France?',
              options: ['Berlin', 'Madrid', 'Paris', 'Lisbon'],
              correctAnswer: 'Paris',
            ),
            Question(
              questionText: 'Is Flutter a framework for web development?',
              options: ['Yes', 'No'],
              correctAnswer: 'No',
            ),
          ],
          onQuizCompleted: (score) {
            // Handle quiz completion
            print('Your score: $score');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic quiz with two questions. The `QuickQuizView` widget takes a list of `Question` objects and displays them to the user. The `onQuizCompleted` callback is triggered when the quiz is finished, allowing you to handle the score.

With these steps, you can easily integrate the `quick_quiz_view` package into your Flutter application.

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Quick Quiz Example')),
        body: QuickQuizView(
          // Define the list of questions for the quiz
          questions: [
            Question(
              questionText: 'What is the capital of France?',
              options: ['Berlin', 'Madrid', 'Paris', 'Lisbon'],
              correctAnswer: 'Paris', // Specify the correct answer
            ),
            Question(
              questionText: 'Is Flutter a framework for web development?',
              options: ['Yes', 'No'],
              correctAnswer: 'No', // Specify the correct answer
            ),
          ],
          // Callback function that is called when the quiz is completed
          onQuizCompleted: (score) {
            // Display the score in a dialog
            showDialog(
              context: context,
              builder: (context) {
                return AlertDialog(
                  title: Text('Quiz Completed'),
                  content: Text('Your score: $score'), // Show the user's score
                  actions: [
                    TextButton(
                      onPressed: () {
                        Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                      },
                      child: Text('OK'),
                    ),
                  ],
                );
              },
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the app
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation
// The application starts by running the `RealFlutter` class.
// The `MaterialApp` widget sets up the app's basic structure.
// Inside the `Scaffold`, an `AppBar` is created with the title "Quick Quiz Example".
// The `QuickQuizView` widget is used to display the quiz.
// A list of `Question` objects is passed to the `questions` parameter, each containing the question text, options, and the correct answer.
// The `onQuizCompleted` callback is defined to handle the score when the quiz is finished.
// When the quiz is completed, an `AlertDialog` is shown displaying the user's score.
// The user can dismiss the dialog by pressing the "OK" button.
// Finally, the `main` function runs the app by calling `runApp` with the `RealFlutter` widget.
