# Setting Up the Package
-------------------------

To use the `flutter_widgetkit` package, you will need to add it to your Flutter project. You can do this by adding the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  flutter_widgetkit: ^1.0.0
```
Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

Platform-Specific Details
-------------------------

The `flutter_widgetkit` package is designed to work on both Android and iOS platforms. However, there are some platform-specific details to be aware of:

* On Android, you will need to add the following line to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:
```xml
<application
  ...
  android:hardwareAccelerated="true"
  ...
>
```
This will enable hardware acceleration for your application, which is required for the package to work properly.

* On iOS, you will need to add the following line to your `Info.plist` file:
```xml
<key>UIViewControllerBasedStatusBarAppearance</key>
<false/>
```
This will disable the status bar appearance animation, which can cause issues with the package.

Using the Package
-----------------

To use the package, you will need to import it into your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:flutter_widgetkit/flutter_widgetkit.dart';
```
Then, you can use the pre-built widgets and utilities provided by the package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_widgetkit/flutter_widgetkit.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a new WidgetKit instance
    final kit = WidgetKit(
      // Set the theme for the kit
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
    );

    // Create a new Scaffold instance
    return Scaffold(
      // Set the appBar for the scaffold
      appBar: AppBar(
        // Set the title for the appBar
        title: Text('Real Flutter'),
      ),
      // Set the body for the scaffold
      body: Center(
        // Create a new Column instance
        child: Column(
          // Set the mainAxisAlignment for the column
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          // Create a new list of children for the column
          children: <Widget>[
            // Create a new Text instance
            Text(
              'Hello, World!',
              // Set the style for the text
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            // Create a new SizedBox instance
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Create a new ElevatedButton instance
            ElevatedButton(
              // Set the onPressed callback for the button
              onPressed: () {
                // Print a message to the console
                print('Button pressed!');
              },
              // Set the child for the button
              child: Text('Press me!'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the application.
// 2. The RealFlutter instance is created and run.
// 3. The WidgetKit instance is created and set as the theme for the application.
// 4. The Scaffold instance is created and set as the body for the application.
// 5. The Column instance is created and set as the child for the Scaffold.
// 6. The Text instance is created and set as the child for the Column.
// 7. The SizedBox instance is created and set as the child for the Column.
// 8. The ElevatedButton instance is created and set as the child for the Column.
// 9. The user presses the button.
// 10. The onPressed callback is called and prints a message to the console.

// In summary, the application creates a new RealFlutter instance and runs it.
// The RealFlutter instance creates a new WidgetKit instance and sets it as the theme for the application.
// The application then creates a new Scaffold instance and sets it as the body for the application.
// The Scaffold instance creates a new Column instance and sets it as the child for the Scaffold.
// The Column instance creates a new Text instance, SizedBox instance, and ElevatedButton instance, and sets them as the children for the Column.
// When the user presses the button, the onPressed callback is called and prints a message to the console.
