# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Custom Calendar Viewer

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `custom_calendar_viewer` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `custom_calendar_viewer` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  custom_calendar_viewer: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if your calendar requires access to the user's calendar data:

```xml
<key>NSCalendarsUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your calendar.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to implement the `custom_calendar_viewer`.

<!-- END_TUTORIAL -->

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:custom_calendar_viewer/custom_calendar_viewer.dart'; // Import the package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the main app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Custom Calendar Viewer',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: CalendarHome(), // Set the home widget
    );
  }
}

class CalendarHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CalendarHomeState createState() => _CalendarHomeState();
}

class _CalendarHomeState extends State<CalendarHome> {
  DateTime selectedDate = DateTime.now(); // Initialize selected date
  List<Event> events = []; // List to hold events

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Load initial events
    events = [
      Event(date: DateTime.now(), title: 'Today\'s Event'),
      Event(date: DateTime.now().add(Duration(days: 1)), title: 'Tomorrow\'s Event'),
    ];
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Custom Calendar Viewer'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Calendar widget
          CustomCalendarViewer(
            onDateSelected: (date) {
              setState(() {
                selectedDate = date; // Update selected date
              });
            },
            events: events, // Pass events to the calendar
          ),
          // Display selected date
          Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
            child: Text(
              'Selected Date: ${selectedDate.toLocal()}'.split(' ')[0], // Show selected date
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home widget is set to CalendarHome, which is a stateful widget.
// 4. In the CalendarHome state, we initialize the selected date and a list of events.
// 5. The build method constructs the UI, including the CustomCalendarViewer and a Text widget to display the selected date.
// 6. When a date is selected in the calendar, the onDateSelected callback updates the selected date and rebuilds the UI to reflect the change.
```
