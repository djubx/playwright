# Stream Disposable: A Comprehensive Overview

The `stream_disposable` package is a powerful tool for managing streams in Flutter applications. It simplifies the process of disposing of stream subscriptions, ensuring that resources are released properly and preventing memory leaks. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where you have multiple streams that need to be managed efficiently, such as in complex applications with real-time data updates.

## When to Use `stream_disposable`
- **Real-time Data**: When your application requires real-time data updates, such as chat applications or live feeds.
- **Multiple Streams**: When you need to manage multiple streams simultaneously, ensuring that each stream is properly disposed of when no longer needed.
- **Resource Management**: To prevent memory leaks by ensuring that stream subscriptions are disposed of correctly.

## Key Features
- **Automatic Disposal**: Automatically disposes of stream subscriptions when the widget is removed from the widget tree.
- **Ease of Use**: Simplifies the management of streams, making it easier to integrate into your Flutter applications.
- **Flexible API**: Provides a flexible API that can be easily adapted to various use cases.

Overall, `stream_disposable` is an essential package for Flutter developers looking to manage streams effectively and efficiently.

# Setting Up and Using Stream Disposable

## Installation
To add the `stream_disposable` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  stream_disposable: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/stream_disposable).

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No specific configurations are required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `stream_disposable` package, you need to create a class that extends `StatefulWidget` and utilize the `StreamDisposable` mixin. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:stream_disposable/stream_disposable.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> with StreamDisposable {
  // Define your stream here
  late Stream<int> _numberStream;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the stream
    _numberStream = Stream.periodic(Duration(seconds: 1), (count) => count);
    // Subscribe to the stream
    listenToStream(_numberStream, (number) {
      // Handle the incoming data
      print('Received number: $number');
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Stream Disposable Example')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Check console for stream output')),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple stream that emits an integer every second. The `listenToStream` method is used to subscribe to the stream, and the subscription is automatically disposed of when the widget is removed from the widget tree.

# Complete Example of Stream Disposable

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:stream_disposable/stream_disposable.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> with StreamDisposable {
  // Define a stream that emits integers every second
  late Stream<int> _numberStream;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the stream
    _numberStream = Stream.periodic(Duration(seconds: 1), (count) => count);
    // Subscribe to the stream and handle incoming data
    listenToStream(_numberStream, (number) {
      // Print the received number to the console
      print('Received number: $number');
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Stream Disposable Example')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Check console for stream output')),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget, which is the root of the application.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 3. In the _RealFlutterState class, we define a stream that emits an integer every second.
// 4. In the initState method, we initialize the stream and subscribe to it using listenToStream.
// 5. The incoming data from the stream is printed to the console.
// 6. The build method returns a simple UI with an AppBar and a Center widget displaying a message.
// 7. When the widget is removed from the widget tree, the stream subscription is automatically disposed of, preventing memory leaks.
