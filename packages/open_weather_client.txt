# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Open Weather Client Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `open_weather_client` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `open_weather_client` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  open_weather_client: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Obtain an API Key

1. Go to the [OpenWeatherMap website](https://openweathermap.org/api).
2. Sign up for an account and create an API key.
3. Keep this key secure, as it will be used to authenticate your requests.

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

1. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to allow network requests:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. Below is an example of how to fetch and display weather data.

# Complete Example: Weather Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:open_weather_client/open_weather_client.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyWeatherApp());
}

class MyWeatherApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Weather App',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: WeatherHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class WeatherHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _WeatherHomePageState createState() => _WeatherHomePageState();
}

class _WeatherHomePageState extends State<WeatherHomePage> {
  final String apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY'; // Replace with your OpenWeatherMap API key
  WeatherClient? weatherClient; // Declare a WeatherClient instance
  WeatherData? weatherData; // Variable to hold fetched weather data
  String cityName = 'London'; // Default city name

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    weatherClient = WeatherClient(apiKey: apiKey); // Initialize the WeatherClient
    fetchWeatherData(); // Fetch weather data on app start
  }

  // Function to fetch weather data
  Future<void> fetchWeatherData() async {
    try {
      // Fetch weather data for the specified city
      weatherData = await weatherClient!.getWeatherByCityName(cityName);
      setState(() {}); // Update the UI with the fetched data
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error fetching weather data: $e'); // Handle errors
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Weather in $cityName')),
      body: weatherData == null // Check if weather data is available
          ? Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator()) // Show loading indicator
          : Column(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              children: [
                Text(
                  'Temperature: ${weatherData!.main.temp}Â°C', // Display temperature
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
                ),
                Text(
                  'Weather: ${weatherData!.weather[0].description}', // Display weather description
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18),
                ),
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: fetchWeatherData, // Refresh weather data on button press
                  child: Text('Refresh'),
                ),
              ],
            ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyWeatherApp widget.
// 2. MyWeatherApp sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home page as WeatherHomePage.
// 3. WeatherHomePage initializes the WeatherClient with the API key and fetches weather data in initState.
// 4. The fetchWeatherData function retrieves weather data for the specified city and updates the state.
// 5. The build method checks if weather data is available. If not, it shows a loading indicator.
// 6. Once the data is fetched, it displays the temperature and weather description, along with a refresh button.
```
