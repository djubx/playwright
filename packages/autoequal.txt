Here's a detailed technical blog on the "autoequal" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# AutoEqual Flutter Package

The **AutoEqual** package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that simplifies the process of creating value equality in Dart classes. It automates the generation of equality operators (`==` and `!=`), hash codes, and the `toString` method, which can significantly reduce boilerplate code and improve code maintainability.

## When to Use AutoEqual

You should consider using the AutoEqual package when:
- You have data classes that require equality checks.
- You want to reduce boilerplate code in your Dart classes.
- You need to ensure that your classes are easily comparable and can be used in collections like `Set` or as keys in `Map`.

## Features

- **Automatic Generation**: Automatically generates equality operators and hash codes based on the fields of your class.
- **Customizable**: Allows customization of which fields to include in equality checks.
- **Integration**: Easily integrates with existing Flutter projects.

## Example Use Cases

1. **Data Models**: When creating data models for your application, such as user profiles or product details, AutoEqual can help ensure that instances of these models are compared correctly.
2. **State Management**: In state management solutions like Provider or Riverpod, using AutoEqual can help manage state changes more effectively by ensuring that only necessary updates occur.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using AutoEqual

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the AutoEqual package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  autoequal: ^1.0.0
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Configuring Your Class

To use AutoEqual, you need to annotate your class with `@AutoEqual`. Here’s how you can do it:

```dart
import 'package:autoequal/autoequal.dart';

part 'your_class.g.dart'; // This is necessary for code generation

@AutoEqual()
class RealFlutter {
  final String name;
  final int age;

  RealFlutter(this.name, this.age);
}
```

## Step 3: Generating Code

After setting up your class, you need to run the code generator. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build
```

This command will generate the necessary code for equality checks and hash codes in a file named `your_class.g.dart`.

## Step 4: Using Your Class

Now that your class is set up, you can use it like any other Dart class. Here’s an example of how to create instances and compare them:

```dart
void main() {
  final person1 = RealFlutter('Alice', 30);
  final person2 = RealFlutter('Alice', 30);
  
  print(person1 == person2); // This will print: true
}
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Conclusion

With these steps, you can easily set up and use the AutoEqual package in your Flutter applications. It streamlines the process of implementing equality in your data classes, making your code cleaner and more maintainable.

# Complete Example of Using AutoEqual

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:autoequal/autoequal.dart';

part 'real_flutter.g.dart'; // Necessary for code generation

@AutoEqual()
class RealFlutter {
  final String name; // Field for the name
  final int age; // Field for the age

  RealFlutter(this.name, this.age); // Constructor
}

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp()); // Start the Flutter application
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'AutoEqual Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('AutoEqual Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: EqualityDemo(), // Widget to demonstrate equality
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class EqualityDemo extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create two instances of RealFlutter
    final person1 = RealFlutter('Alice', 30);
    final person2 = RealFlutter('Alice', 30);
    final person3 = RealFlutter('Bob', 25);

    // Check equality
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Text('Person 1: $person1'),
        Text('Person 2: $person2'),
        Text('Person 3: $person3'),
        SizedBox(height: 20),
        Text('Person 1 == Person 2: ${person1 == person2}'), // true
        Text('Person 1 == Person 3: ${person1 == person3}'), // false
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the Flutter application by calling runApp() with MyApp().
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. The Center widget contains the EqualityDemo widget, which demonstrates the use of the RealFlutter class.
// 4. In EqualityDemo, three instances of RealFlutter are created: person1, person2, and person3.
// 5. The equality of these instances is checked and displayed in the UI.
// 6. The output shows that person1 and person2 are equal, while person1 and person3 are not.
```
