# Adaptive Action Sheet Flutter Package

The `adaptive_action_sheet` Flutter package provides a flexible and customizable way to present action sheets in your Flutter applications. Action sheets are a common UI pattern used to present users with a set of options or actions related to a specific context. This package allows developers to create adaptive action sheets that can adjust their appearance based on the platform (iOS or Android), ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.

## When to Use

You might consider using the `adaptive_action_sheet` package in scenarios such as:
- When you need to present a list of actions to the user in a modal format.
- When you want to provide context-specific options based on user interactions.
- When you want to maintain a consistent look and feel across different platforms.

## Features

- **Adaptive Design**: Automatically adjusts the appearance of the action sheet based on the platform.
- **Customizable**: Allows for customization of the action sheet's title, message, and actions.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API for integrating into existing Flutter applications.
- **Support for Multiple Actions**: Easily add multiple actions with different styles (e.g., destructive actions).

Overall, the `adaptive_action_sheet` package enhances the user experience by providing a native look and feel for action sheets across platforms.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Adaptive Action Sheet

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `adaptive_action_sheet` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  adaptive_action_sheet: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:adaptive_action_sheet/adaptive_action_sheet.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Adaptive Action Sheet

You can use the `showAdaptiveActionSheet` function to display the action sheet. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

### Example Code

```dart
void _showActionSheet(BuildContext context) {
  showAdaptiveActionSheet(
    context: context,
    title: Text('Choose an option'),
    actions: <ActionSheetAction>[
      ActionSheetAction(
        title: Text('Option 1'),
        onPressed: () {
          // Handle Option 1
          Navigator.pop(context);
        },
      ),
      ActionSheetAction(
        title: Text('Option 2'),
        onPressed: () {
          // Handle Option 2
          Navigator.pop(context);
        },
      ),
      ActionSheetAction(
        title: Text('Cancel'),
        isDestructiveAction: true,
        onPressed: () {
          // Handle Cancel
          Navigator.pop(context);
        },
      ),
    ],
  );
}
```

### Platform-Specific Details

- **Android**: The action sheet will appear as a bottom sheet, which is the standard behavior for Android applications.
- **iOS**: The action sheet will appear as a modal dialog, consistent with iOS design guidelines.

## Step 4: Testing the Action Sheet

Run your application on both Android and iOS devices or emulators to see the adaptive action sheet in action. Ensure that the appearance and behavior are as expected on both platforms.

### Additional Configurations

For iOS, you may want to ensure that your app's Info.plist file includes any necessary permissions or configurations, especially if your actions involve accessing device features.

That's it! You have successfully integrated the `adaptive_action_sheet` package into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using Adaptive Action Sheet

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:adaptive_action_sheet/adaptive_action_sheet.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Adaptive Action Sheet Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Adaptive Action Sheet Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Show the adaptive action sheet when the button is pressed
              _showActionSheet(context);
            },
            child: Text('Show Action Sheet'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void _showActionSheet(BuildContext context) {
    // Display the adaptive action sheet
    showAdaptiveActionSheet(
      context: context,
      title: Text('Choose an option'),
      actions: <ActionSheetAction>[
        ActionSheetAction(
          title: Text('Option 1'),
          onPressed: () {
            // Handle Option 1
            Navigator.pop(context);
          },
        ),
        ActionSheetAction(
          title: Text('Option 2'),
          onPressed: () {
            // Handle Option 2
            Navigator.pop(context);
          },
        ),
        ActionSheetAction(
          title: Text('Cancel'),
          isDestructiveAction: true,
          onPressed: () {
            // Handle Cancel
            Navigator.pop(context);
          },
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget with an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the _showActionSheet function is called.
// 5. The _showActionSheet function displays the adaptive action sheet with three options: Option 1, Option 2, and Cancel.
// 6. Each option has an onPressed callback that handles the action and dismisses the action sheet using Navigator.pop(context).
// 7. The action sheet adapts its appearance based on the platform (iOS or Android).
// 8. The app provides a seamless user experience by presenting options in a familiar format for each platform.
