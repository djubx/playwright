<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Download Task Flutter Package

The **download_task** Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to facilitate file downloading in Flutter applications. It provides a simple and efficient way to manage download tasks, including the ability to pause, resume, and cancel downloads. This package is particularly useful for applications that require downloading large files, such as media files, documents, or any other type of data that users may need to access offline.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the **download_task** package in scenarios such as:
- Downloading media files (audio, video, images) for offline access.
- Fetching documents or reports that users may need to view later.
- Implementing a download manager within your app to handle multiple downloads simultaneously.

## Features

- **Pause and Resume**: Users can pause ongoing downloads and resume them later without losing progress.
- **Cancel Downloads**: Users can cancel downloads at any time.
- **Progress Tracking**: The package provides real-time updates on download progress.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in mechanisms to handle errors during the download process.

Overall, the **download_task** package simplifies the process of downloading files in Flutter, making it a valuable addition to any developer's toolkit.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Download Task Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **download_task** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  download_task: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/download_task).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, you need to ensure that your app has the necessary permissions to access the internet and write to external storage. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to add the following permissions in your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to the photo library.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to implement the download functionality.

# Complete Example: Downloading a File

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:download_task/download_task.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String? _downloadId; // Variable to hold the download ID
  double _progress = 0.0; // Variable to track download progress

  // Function to start the download
  void _startDownload() async {
    // Define the URL of the file to download
    String url = 'https://example.com/file.zip';
    // Define the path where the file will be saved
    String path = '/storage/emulated/0/Download/file.zip';

    // Start the download task
    _downloadId = await DownloadTask.startDownload(
      url: url,
      savedDir: path,
      fileName: 'file.zip',
      showNotification: true,
      openFileFromNotification: true,
    );

    // Listen for download progress updates
    DownloadTask.progressStream.listen((event) {
      setState(() {
        _progress = event.progress.toDouble(); // Update progress
      });
    });
  }

  // Function to pause the download
  void _pauseDownload() async {
    if (_downloadId != null) {
      await DownloadTask.pauseDownload(_downloadId!);
    }
  }

  // Function to resume the download
  void _resumeDownload() async {
    if (_downloadId != null) {
      await DownloadTask.resumeDownload(_downloadId!);
    }
  }

  // Function to cancel the download
  void _cancelDownload() async {
    if (_downloadId != null) {
      await DownloadTask.cancelDownload(_downloadId!);
      setState(() {
        _downloadId = null; // Reset download ID
        _progress = 0.0; // Reset progress
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Download Task Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              Text('Download Progress: ${(_progress * 100).toStringAsFixed(0)}%'),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _startDownload,
                child: Text('Start Download'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _pauseDownload,
                child: Text('Pause Download'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _resumeDownload,
                child: Text('Resume Download'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _cancelDownload,
                child: Text('Cancel Download'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget maintains the download ID and progress state.
// 3. The _startDownload function initiates the download task and listens for progress updates.
// 4. The user can pause, resume, or cancel the download using the respective buttons.
// 5. The UI updates to reflect the current download progress, providing real-time feedback to the user.
```
