# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Advstory

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the advstory package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the advstory package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  advstory: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # Ensure this is set to at least 10.0
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that we have the package set up, let's create a simple story using the `RealFlutter` class.

### Example Code

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:advstory/advstory.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Advstory Example',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Interactive Story')),
      body: StoryWidget(
        story: Story(
          nodes: [
            StoryNode(
              id: 'start',
              text: 'Welcome to the adventure! Do you want to go left or right?',
              choices: [
                StoryChoice(
                  text: 'Left',
                  nextNodeId: 'leftPath',
                ),
                StoryChoice(
                  text: 'Right',
                  nextNodeId: 'rightPath',
                ),
              ],
            ),
            StoryNode(
              id: 'leftPath',
              text: 'You chose the left path. It’s dark and spooky!',
              choices: [
                StoryChoice(
                  text: 'Go back',
                  nextNodeId: 'start',
                ),
              ],
            ),
            StoryNode(
              id: 'rightPath',
              text: 'You chose the right path. It’s bright and sunny!',
              choices: [
                StoryChoice(
                  text: 'Explore further',
                  nextNodeId: 'explore',
                ),
                StoryChoice(
                  text: 'Go back',
                  nextNodeId: 'start',
                ),
              ],
            ),
            StoryNode(
              id: 'explore',
              text: 'You found a treasure chest! You win!',
              choices: [],
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Main Function**: The entry point of the application, where `MyApp` is run.
- **MyApp Class**: Sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
- **RealFlutter Class**: Contains the main UI for the story.
- **StoryWidget**: Displays the story and handles user choices.
- **Story and StoryNode**: Define the structure of the story, including nodes and choices.

                  text: 'Explore further',
                  nextNodeId: 'explore',
                ),

                  nextNodeId: 'start',

              choices: [],
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Explanation of the application flow:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs MyApp.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home as RealFlutter.
// 3. RealFlutter builds the UI with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a StoryWidget.
// 4. The StoryWidget takes a Story object that defines the narrative structure.
// 5. The story begins at the 'start' node, presenting the user with two choices: 'Left' or 'Right'.
// 6. Depending on the user's choice, the app navigates to the corresponding node, displaying the text and further choices.
// 7. The user can continue making choices until they reach an endpoint, such as winning the game or going back to the start.
