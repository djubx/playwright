# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `calendar_timeline_sbk`

## Installation
To get started with the `calendar_timeline_sbk` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  calendar_timeline_sbk: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/calendar_timeline_sbk).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to set the platform version in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package
Once you have installed the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the `calendar_timeline_sbk` widget.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:calendar_timeline_sbk/calendar_timeline_sbk.dart';
```

2. Use the `CalendarTimeline` widget in your widget tree:

```dart
CalendarTimeline(
  initialDate: DateTime.now(),
  firstDate: DateTime(2020, 1, 1),
  lastDate: DateTime(2025, 12, 31),
  onDateSelected: (date) => print(date),
  // Customize the appearance
  monthColor: Colors.blue,
  dayColor: Colors.black,
  selectedColor: Colors.red,
  dotsColor: Colors.blue,
);
```

This will create a basic timeline calendar that allows users to select dates.

# Complete Example of `calendar_timeline_sbk`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:calendar_timeline_sbk/calendar_timeline_sbk.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Calendar Timeline Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Calendar Timeline Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: CalendarTimeline(
            initialDate: DateTime.now(), // Set the initial date to today
            firstDate: DateTime(2020, 1, 1), // The earliest date selectable
            lastDate: DateTime(2025, 12, 31), // The latest date selectable
            onDateSelected: (date) {
              // Callback when a date is selected
              print("Selected date: $date");
            },
            monthColor: Colors.blue, // Color for the month text
            dayColor: Colors.black, // Color for the day text
            selectedColor: Colors.red, // Color for the selected date
            dotsColor: Colors.blue, // Color for the event dots
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, the CalendarTimeline widget is instantiated.
// 5. The CalendarTimeline is configured with initial, first, and last selectable dates.
// 6. The onDateSelected callback prints the selected date to the console.
// 7. The appearance of the calendar is customized using color properties.
// 8. When a user selects a date, the selected date is printed in the console.
