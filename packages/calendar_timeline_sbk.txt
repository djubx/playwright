// The app starts by running the `main` function, which creates a new instance of the `MyApp` widget.
// The `MyApp` widget is a stateless widget that returns a `MaterialApp` widget with a title and a home page.
// The home page is an instance of the `RealFlutter` widget, which is a stateful widget that contains a list of events.
// The `RealFlutter` widget returns a `Scaffold` widget with an app bar and a body.
// The body is a `CalendarTimeline` widget that displays the list of events.
// The `CalendarTimeline` widget is customized with a custom event builder that returns a blue container with the event title.
