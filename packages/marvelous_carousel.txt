# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Marvelous Carousel

## Installation
To get started with the marvelous_carousel package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  marvelous_carousel: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/marvelous_carousel).

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package
Now that you have installed the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the marvelous_carousel in your app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:marvelous_carousel/marvelous_carousel.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Marvelous Carousel Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: MarvelousCarousel(
            images: [
              'https://example.com/image1.jpg',
              'https://example.com/image2.jpg',
              'https://example.com/image3.jpg',
            ],
            autoScroll: true,
            indicatorDots: true,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays a carousel of images. The `MarvelousCarousel` widget takes a list of image URLs and displays them in a carousel format. The `autoScroll` property enables automatic scrolling, and `indicatorDots` shows the current image indicator.

With this setup, you can easily create a visually appealing image carousel in your Flutter app.

# Complete Example of Marvelous Carousel

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:marvelous_carousel/marvelous_carousel.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Marvelous Carousel Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Centering the carousel in the middle of the screen
          child: MarvelousCarousel(
            images: [
              // List of image URLs to display in the carousel
              'https://example.com/image1.jpg',
              'https://example.com/image2.jpg',
              'https://example.com/image3.jpg',
            ],
            autoScroll: true, // Enables automatic scrolling of images
            indicatorDots: true, // Shows dots indicating the current image
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  // Entry point of the application
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the Flutter application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold widget is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. The Center widget contains the MarvelousCarousel widget, which takes a list of image URLs.
// 5. The carousel automatically scrolls through the images and displays indicator dots for navigation.
// 6. When the app runs, users will see a carousel of images that they can swipe through or watch auto-scroll.
