# Overview of the `css_colors` Flutter Package

The `css_colors` Flutter package is a convenient tool for developers who want to use CSS color names directly in their Flutter applications. This package simplifies the process of color selection by allowing developers to use familiar CSS color names instead of manually defining color values. This can be particularly useful for web developers transitioning to Flutter, as it provides a seamless way to apply their existing knowledge of CSS colors.

## When to Use `css_colors`

- **Web to Mobile Transition**: If you're a web developer familiar with CSS color names, this package allows you to use those same names in your Flutter projects.
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Quickly apply colors without needing to look up or convert color codes.
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistency across web and mobile platforms by using the same color names.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Color List**: Access to all standard CSS color names.
- **Ease of Use**: Simple API that integrates seamlessly with Flutter's existing color system.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal impact on app size and performance.

# Setting Up and Using the `css_colors` Package

In this section, we'll walk through the setup process for the `css_colors` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application. We'll cover platform-specific details for both Android and iOS.

## Setup Process

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `css_colors` package under dependencies.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     css_colors: ^1.0.0
   ```

2. **Install Package**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the package.

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Import Package**: In your Dart file, import the package to start using it.

   ```dart
   import 'package:css_colors/css_colors.dart';
   ```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

- Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to support all Flutter features.

  ```gradle
  defaultConfig {
      minSdkVersion 21
  }
  ```

### iOS

- Make sure your iOS deployment target is set to at least 9.0 in your `ios/Podfile`.

  ```ruby
  platform :ios, '9.0'
  ```

## Using the Package

Once the package is set up, you can use CSS color names directly in your Flutter widgets. Here's a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:css_colors/css_colors.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('CSS Colors Example'),
          backgroundColor: CSSColors.blue,
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Container(
            color: CSSColors.lightCoral,
            child: Text(
              'Hello, CSS Colors!',
              style: TextStyle(color: CSSColors.white),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:css_colors/css_colors.dart';

// Main entry point of the Flutter application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// RealFlutter is the main widget of the application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // MaterialApp is the root of the application
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        // Scaffold provides the basic structure for the app screen
        appBar: AppBar(
          // AppBar with a title and a background color from CSSColors
          title: Text('CSS Colors Example'),
          backgroundColor: CSSColors.blue,
        ),
        body: Center(
          // Center widget centers its child within itself
          child: Container(
            // Container with a background color and a child Text widget
            color: CSSColors.lightCoral,
            padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
            child: Text(
              'Hello, CSS Colors!',
              style: TextStyle(
                color: CSSColors.white, // Text color using CSSColors
                fontSize: 24,
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The application starts by calling the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` widget.
// `RealFlutter` is a stateless widget that builds a `MaterialApp`.
// The `MaterialApp` contains a `Scaffold`, which provides the basic visual layout structure.
// The `AppBar` at the top of the `Scaffold` uses a CSS color for its background.
// The `body` of the `Scaffold` is a `Center` widget that centers its child, a `Container`.
// The `Container` has a background color set using a CSS color and contains a `Text` widget.
// The `Text` widget displays a message with a color and font size specified.
