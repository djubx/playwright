# Complete Example: Implementing Extensive Date Range Picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:extensive_date_range_picker/extensive_date_range_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Extensive Date Range Picker Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: DateRangePickerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class DateRangePickerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DateRangePickerScreenState createState() => _DateRangePickerScreenState();
}

class _DateRangePickerScreenState extends State<DateRangePickerScreen> {
  DateTimeRange? selectedDateRange; // Variable to hold the selected date range

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Select Date Range'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the selected date range or a prompt
            Text(
              selectedDateRange == null
                  ? 'No date range selected'
                  : 'Selected: ${selectedDateRange!.start} - ${selectedDateRange!.end}',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () async {
                // Show the date range picker when the button is pressed
                final DateTimeRange? picked = await showDateRangePicker(
                  context: context,
                  firstDate: DateTime.now(),
                  lastDate: DateTime(2025),
                );
                // Update the state with the selected date range
                if (picked != null && picked != selectedDateRange) {
                  setState(() {
                    selectedDateRange = picked;
                  });
                }
              },
              child: Text('Pick Date Range'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home screen is DateRangePickerScreen, which is a stateful widget.
// 4. Inside DateRangePickerScreen, we define a variable to hold the selected date range.
// 5. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 6. The Center widget contains a Column that displays the selected date range or a prompt.
// 7. An ElevatedButton is provided to trigger the date range picker.
// 8. When the button is pressed, the showDateRangePicker function is called.
// 9. If a date range is selected, the state is updated, and the UI reflects the new selection.
