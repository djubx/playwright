# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `column_layout`

## Installation
To get started with the `column_layout` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  column_layout: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
The `column_layout` package is designed to work seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms. There are no specific configurations required for either platform, making it easy to integrate into your existing Flutter projects.

## Basic Usage
To use the `column_layout` package, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:column_layout/column_layout.dart';
```

You can then create a simple column layout using the `ColumnLayout` widget provided by the package. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
ColumnLayout(
  children: [
    Text('First Item'),
    Text('Second Item'),
    Text('Third Item'),
  ],
);
```

This will create a vertical layout with three text items stacked on top of each other.

# Complete Example of `column_layout`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:column_layout/column_layout.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Column Layout Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Column Layout Demo'),
        ),
        body: ColumnLayout(
          // Using ColumnLayout to manage vertical arrangement of widgets
          children: [
            Container(
              color: Colors.red,
              height: 100,
              child: Center(child: Text('Item 1')),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between items
            Container(
              color: Colors.green,
              height: 100,
              child: Center(child: Text('Item 2')),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between items
            Container(
              color: Colors.blue,
              height: 100,
              child: Center(child: Text('Item 3')),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Column Layout Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold uses the ColumnLayout widget to arrange its children vertically.
// 5. Each child is a Container with a specific height and background color, displaying centered text.
// 6. SizedBox widgets are used to add vertical spacing between the items for better visual separation.
// 7. The layout is responsive and will adjust based on the device's screen size.
