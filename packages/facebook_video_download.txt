## Using the Package
Once you have installed the package and configured your project, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to download a video from Facebook.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:facebook_video_download/facebook_video_download.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Facebook Video Download')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Replace with the actual Facebook video URL
              String videoUrl = 'https://www.facebook.com/video_url_here';
              String? downloadUrl = await FacebookVideoDownload.downloadVideo(videoUrl);
              if (downloadUrl != null) {
                // Handle the download URL (e.g., save it or play it)
                print('Video downloaded: $downloadUrl');
              } else {
                print('Failed to download video.');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Download Video'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app with a button that, when pressed, attempts to download a video from a specified Facebook URL. The download URL is printed to the console if successful.

// 2. An AppBar is created with the title 'Facebook Video Download'.
// 3. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 4. An ElevatedButton is displayed, which, when pressed, triggers the video download process.
// 5. The video URL is specified (this should be a valid Facebook video URL).
// 6. The downloadVideo method from the facebook_video_download package is called with the video URL.
// 7. If the download is successful, the download URL is printed to the console.
// 8. If the download fails, an error message is printed to the console.
