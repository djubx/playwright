  }
}

// The app starts by running the main function, which creates a MaterialApp instance.
// The MaterialApp instance has a title and a theme, and it uses the MyHomePage widget as its home page.
// The MyHomePage widget is a stateless widget that builds a Scaffold instance.
// The Scaffold instance has an AppBar with a title, and its body is a Center widget that contains a TitledContainer widget.
// The TitledContainer widget has a title, subtitle, padding, margin, and shape, and it contains a Text widget as its child.
// The Text widget displays a sample message.
