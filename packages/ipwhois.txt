## When to Use This Package
- **Geolocation Services**: When you need to determine the geographical location of users based on their IP addresses.
- **Analytics**: To gather insights about user demographics and behavior based on their location.
- **Security**: To implement features that restrict access based on geographical regions.

## Key Features
- **IP Lookup**: Retrieve detailed information about an IP address, including country, region, city, and more.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that can be easily integrated into any Flutter application.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the ipwhois Package

## Installation
To use the `ipwhois` package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ipwhois: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you plan to access location services. However, for basic IP lookups, no special permissions are required.

## Using the Package
To use the `ipwhois` package, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:
   ```dart
   import 'package:ipwhois/ipwhois.dart';
   ```

2. Create an instance of the `IpWhois` class and call the `lookup` method to get information about an IP address.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the package:

```dart
void getIpInfo(String ip) async {
  final ipWhois = IpWhois();
  final result = await ipWhois.lookup(ip);
  print(result);
}
```

This function retrieves and prints the information associated with the provided IP address.

# Complete Example of Using the ipwhois Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ipwhois/ipwhois.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'IP Whois Example',
      home: IpInfoScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class IpInfoScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _IpInfoScreenState createState() => _IpInfoScreenState();
}

class _IpInfoScreenState extends State<IpInfoScreen> {
  String _ipInfo = 'Press the button to get IP info';

  // Function to fetch IP information
  void _fetchIpInfo() async {
    final ipWhois = IpWhois();
    // Replace '8.8.8.8' with the desired IP address
    final result = await ipWhois.lookup('8.8.8.8');
    // Update the state with the fetched information
    setState(() {
      _ipInfo = result.toString();
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('IP Whois Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(_ipInfo), // Display the IP information
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _fetchIpInfo, // Fetch IP info on button press
              child: Text('Get IP Info'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and home screen set to IpInfoScreen.
// 3. IpInfoScreen is a stateful widget that maintains the state of the IP information.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the _fetchIpInfo function is called.
// 5. This function creates an instance of IpWhois and calls the lookup method with a sample IP address ('8.8.8.8').
// 6. The result is then converted to a string and displayed on the screen by updating the state.
// 7. The user can press the button multiple times to fetch the IP information again.
