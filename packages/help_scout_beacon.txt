}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Initialize Help Scout Beacon with your Help Scout Beacon ID
    HelpScoutBeacon.init('YOUR_BEACON_ID');

    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Help Scout Beacon Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Help Scout Beacon Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Show the Help Scout Beacon when the button is pressed
              HelpScoutBeacon.show();
            },
            child: Text('Open Help Scout Beacon'),
          ),

  }
}
```

    // Initialize Help Scout Beacon with your Help Scout Beacon ID
    HelpScoutBeacon.init('YOUR_BEACON_ID');

    return MaterialApp(

            child: Text('Open Help Scout Beacon'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. Inside the RealFlutter widget, we initialize the Help Scout Beacon with a specific Beacon ID.
// 3. The MaterialApp widget is created with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 4. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Help Scout Beacon Example".
// 5. In the body of the Scaffold, we have a Center widget that contains an ElevatedButton.
