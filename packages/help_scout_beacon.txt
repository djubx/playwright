// This is the main entry point of the app.
// We initialize the Help Scout Beacon with our API key in the initState method.
// We then create a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// Inside the Center widget, we use the HelpScoutBeacon widget to wrap our ElevatedButton.
// When the button is pressed, we open the chat window using the HelpScoutBeacon.openChat method.

// The app flow is as follows:
// 1. The user opens the app and the Help Scout Beacon is initialized with our API key.
// 2. The user clicks the "Open Chat" button, which opens the chat window.
// 3. The user can then chat with our support team using the chat window.
