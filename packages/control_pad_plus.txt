// This code creates a Flutter application with three control pads.
// The first control pad has a size of 200 and a blue color.
// The second control pad has a size of 200, a red color, and a circular shape.
// The third control pad has a size of 200, a blue color, and gestures and events.
// When the user taps on a control pad, a message is printed to the console.
// When the user long presses on a control pad, a message is printed to the console.
// When the user pans on a control pad, a message is printed to the console.

// The application uses the `ControlPad` widget to create the control pads.
// The `ControlPad` widget takes a number of properties, including `size`, `color`, and `onTap`.
// The `onTap` property is used to handle the tap gesture.
// The `onLongPress` property is used to handle the long press gesture.
// The `onPanUpdate` property is used to handle the pan gesture.

// The application also uses the `MaterialApp` widget to create a material design application.
// The `MaterialApp` widget takes a number of properties, including `title` and `theme`.
// The `title` property is used to set the title of the application.
// The `theme` property is used to set the theme of the application.

// The application also uses the `Scaffold` widget to create a scaffold for the application.
// The `Scaffold` widget takes a number of properties, including `appBar` and `body`.
// The `appBar` property is used to set the app bar of the application.
// The `body` property is used to set the body of the application.
