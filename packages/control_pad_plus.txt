# Complete Example of Control Pad Plus

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:control_pad_plus/control_pad_plus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Control Pad Plus Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Control Pad Plus Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ControlPad(
            // Define the size of the control pad
            size: 200,
            // Define the color of the control pad
            color: Colors.blue,
            // Callback for button press
            onPressed: (button) {
              // Print the button that was pressed
              print('Button pressed: $button');
            },
            // Callback for button release
            onReleased: (button) {
              // Print the button that was released
              print('Button released: $button');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Control Pad Plus Demo'.
// 4. In the body of the Scaffold, a ControlPad widget is centered on the screen.
// 5. The ControlPad is configured with a size of 200 and a blue color.
// 6. The onPressed callback is triggered when a button on the control pad is pressed, printing the button's identifier to the console.
// 7. The onReleased callback is triggered when a button is released, also printing the button's identifier to the console.
// 8. This setup allows for real-time interaction with the control pad, making it suitable for gaming or interactive applications.
