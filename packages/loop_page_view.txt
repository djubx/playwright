# Loop Page View Flutter Package

The `loop_page_view` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to create infinite scrolling page views in your Flutter applications. This package is particularly useful when you want to implement features like image carousels, news tickers, or any other UI component that requires continuous scrolling.

## Features

- **Infinite Scrolling**: Seamlessly scroll through pages without reaching an end.
- **Customizable**: Easily adjust the appearance and behavior of the page view.
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficiently handles large numbers of pages with minimal performance impact.

## When to Use

Consider using the `loop_page_view` package in scenarios where you need to display a series of items in a continuous loop. This is ideal for:

- **Image Carousels**: Display a series of images that users can swipe through endlessly.
- **News Tickers**: Show a continuous stream of news headlines or updates.
- **Product Showcases**: Highlight different products or features in an e-commerce app.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Loop Page View

In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of setting up and using the `loop_page_view` package in a Flutter application. We'll cover platform-specific configurations for both Android and iOS.

## Setup

1. **Add Dependency**

   First, add the `loop_page_view` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     loop_page_view: ^1.0.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**

   Run the following command to install the new package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configurations**

   - **Android**: No additional configuration is required for Android.
   - **iOS**: Ensure that your `ios/Podfile` has platform set to at least 9.0:

     ```ruby
     platform :ios, '9.0'
     ```

## Usage

To use the `loop_page_view` package, import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:loop_page_view/loop_page_view.dart';
```

### Basic Implementation

Here's a simple example of how to implement a looping page view:

```dart
LoopPageView.builder(
  itemCount: 5, // Number of pages
  itemBuilder: (context, index) {
    return Container(
      color: Colors.accents[index % Colors.accents.length],
      child: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Page $index',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.white),
        ),
      ),
    );
  },
)
```

This code creates a looping page view with five pages, each displaying a different color and page number.

# Complete Example: Flutter Main File

Below is a complete example of a Flutter application using the `loop_page_view` package. This example demonstrates all key features of the package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:loop_page_view/loop_page_view.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Loop Page View Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Loop Page View Example'),
      ),
      body: LoopPageView.builder(
        itemCount: 5, // Total number of pages
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          // Building each page
          return Container(
            color: Colors.accents[index % Colors.accents.length],
            child: Center(
              child: Text(
                'Page $index',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.white),
              ),
            ),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The `main` function is the entry point of the Flutter application.
// `MyApp` is the root widget of the application, setting up the MaterialApp.
// `RealFlutter` is the main class where the LoopPageView is implemented.
// The `LoopPageView.builder` creates a looping page view with 5 pages.
// Each page is a colored container with centered text displaying the page number.
