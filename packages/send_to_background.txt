## Setup Process

To get started with the `send_to_background` package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  send_to_background: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/send_to_background).

### Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android Configuration

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE"/>
```

3. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

#### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to allow background execution:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>audio</string>
    <string>fetch</string>
</array>
```

### Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:send_to_background/send_to_background.dart';
```

### Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the package to send your app to the background. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to do this:

```dart
void sendAppToBackground() {
    SendToBackground.send();
}
```

This function can be called based on user actions, such as pressing a button.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:send_to_background/send_to_background.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Send to Background Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Send to Background Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // This button sends the app to the background
            sendAppToBackground();
          },
          child: Text('Send App to Background'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home screen is set to HomeScreen, which contains a button.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the sendAppToBackground function is called.
// 5. This function utilizes the send_to_background package to send the app to the background.
// 6. The app will continue to run in the background, allowing for any ongoing tasks to complete.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, the application initializes with a simple button that, when pressed, sends the app to the background. The comments within the code explain each step of the application flow, ensuring clarity on how the `send_to_background` package is utilized. 

### Final Summary

The `send_to_background` package provides a straightforward way to manage background tasks in Flutter applications. By following the setup and usage instructions, developers can enhance their apps' functionality, ensuring that important processes continue even when the app is not in the foreground. This capability is essential for creating a seamless user experience in modern mobile applications.
