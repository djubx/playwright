# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using uni_links_desktop

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `uni_links_desktop` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

First, add the `uni_links_desktop` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  uni_links_desktop: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/uni_links_desktop).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### For macOS

1. Open your `macos/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following entries to define your URL scheme:

```xml
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
  <dict>
    <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
    <array>
      <string>your_custom_scheme</string>
    </array>
  </dict>
</array>
```

### For Windows

1. Open your `windows/Runner/Runner.rc` file.
2. Add the following lines to define your URL scheme:

```rc
IDR_MAINFRAME           ICON                    "res\\app_icon.ico"
IDR_MAINFRAME           MENU                    "res\\app_menu.rc"
IDR_URL_SCHEME          STRING                  "your_custom_scheme"
```

### For Linux

1. Open your `linux/CMakeLists.txt` file.
2. Ensure you have the following lines to include the necessary libraries:

```cmake
find_package(uni_links_desktop REQUIRED)
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to listen for incoming links.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:uni_links_desktop/uni_links_desktop.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _linkMessage = 'No link received yet.';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _initUniLinks();
  }

  Future<void> _initUniLinks() async {
    // Listen for incoming links
    linkStream.listen((String? link) {
      setState(() {
        _linkMessage = link ?? 'Failed to get link.';
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('uni_links_desktop Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(_linkMessage),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we listen for incoming links and update the UI accordingly. The `_initUniLinks` method sets up a listener that updates the `_linkMessage` variable whenever a new link is received.

# Complete Example of uni_links_desktop

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:uni_links_desktop/uni_links_desktop.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _linkMessage = 'No link received yet.';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _initUniLinks(); // Initialize the uni_links listener
  }

  Future<void> _initUniLinks() async {
    // Listen for incoming links
    linkStream.listen((String? link) {
      setState(() {
        _linkMessage = link ?? 'Failed to get link.'; // Update the message with the received link
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('uni_links_desktop Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(_linkMessage), // Display the link message
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the initState method, we call _initUniLinks to set up the link listener.
// 3. The linkStream listens for any incoming links and updates the _linkMessage variable.
// 4. Whenever a new link is received, the UI is updated to display the link.
// 5. The main UI consists of a simple text widget that shows the current link or a default message.
