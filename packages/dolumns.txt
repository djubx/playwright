# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the "dolumns" Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **dolumns** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and include the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dolumns: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a responsive column layout using the **dolumns** package.

# Complete Example: Using the "dolumns" Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dolumns/dolumns.dart'; // Import the dolumns package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the main application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dolumns Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Dolumns Layout Example'), // App bar title
        ),
        body: Dolumns( // Using the Dolumns widget for responsive layout
          spacing: 10.0, // Space between widgets
          alignment: MainAxisAlignment.center, // Center alignment
          children: <Widget>[
            Container(
              color: Colors.red,
              height: 100,
              width: double.infinity,
              child: Center(child: Text('Item 1', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white))),
            ),
            Container(
              color: Colors.green,
              height: 100,
              width: double.infinity,
              child: Center(child: Text('Item 2', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white))),
            ),
            Container(
              color: Colors.blue,
              height: 100,
              width: double.infinity,
              child: Center(child: Text('Item 3', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white))),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Dolumns Layout Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold uses the Dolumns widget to create a responsive column layout.
// 5. Inside the Dolumns widget, we define a list of children, which are Container widgets.
// 6. Each Container has a different background color and displays a centered text.
// 7. The spacing between the items is set to 10.0, and the alignment is centered.
// 8. The layout automatically adjusts based on the screen size, providing a responsive design.
```
