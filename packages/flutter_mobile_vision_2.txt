<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Flutter Mobile Vision 2 Package

The `flutter_mobile_vision_2` package is a powerful tool for integrating mobile vision capabilities into Flutter applications. It provides a simple interface for accessing the device's camera and performing various vision-related tasks, such as barcode scanning, face detection, and text recognition. This package is particularly useful for applications that require real-time image processing and analysis.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using `flutter_mobile_vision_2` in scenarios such as:
- **Barcode Scanning**: For retail applications that need to scan product barcodes.
- **Face Detection**: In security applications that require user authentication through facial recognition.
- **Text Recognition**: For applications that need to extract text from images, such as document scanning apps.

## Features

- **Real-time Camera Access**: Access the device camera for real-time image processing.
- **Barcode Scanning**: Support for various barcode formats, including QR codes.
- **Face Detection**: Detect and recognize faces in real-time.
- **Text Recognition**: Extract text from images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS devices.

The `flutter_mobile_vision_2` package is a versatile solution for developers looking to add advanced vision capabilities to their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_mobile_vision_2

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_mobile_vision_2` package and demonstrate how to use its features in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_mobile_vision_2` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_mobile_vision_2: ^2.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open `AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
   ```

2. **Minimum SDK Version**: Ensure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open `Info.plist` and add the following keys to request camera access:

   ```xml
   <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to the camera for scanning.</string>
   <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to the photo library for saving images.</string>
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. Below is a complete example demonstrating how to implement barcode scanning using the `flutter_mobile_vision_2` package.

# Complete Example: RealFlutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_mobile_vision_2/flutter_mobile_vision_2.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to hold the scanned barcode result
  String _barcode = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the mobile vision package
    FlutterMobileVision.start().then((_) {
      // Start scanning when the package is ready
      _startScan();
    });
  }

  // Method to start scanning for barcodes
  void _startScan() async {
    try {
      // Start the barcode scanner
      List<Barcode> barcodes = await FlutterMobileVision.scan(
        title: "Scan a barcode",
        waitForResult: true,
      );

      // Update the state with the scanned barcode
      setState(() {
        _barcode = barcodes.first.displayValue; // Get the first scanned barcode
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors during scanning
      setState(() {
        _barcode = 'Error: $e';
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Mobile Vision Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text(
                'Scanned Barcode:',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              Text(
                _barcode.isEmpty ? 'No barcode scanned yet.' : _barcode,
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _startScan, // Start scanning when button is pressed
                child: Text('Scan Again'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the initState method, we initialize the Flutter Mobile Vision package.
// 3. Once initialized, we call the _startScan method to begin scanning for barcodes.
// 4. The _startScan method uses the FlutterMobileVision.scan method to open the camera and scan for barcodes.
// 5. If a barcode is successfully scanned, we update the _barcode variable and display it on the screen.
// 6. The user can press the "Scan Again" button to initiate another scan.
```
