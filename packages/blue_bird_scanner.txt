# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using blue_bird_scanner

## Installation
To get started with the `blue_bird_scanner` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  blue_bird_scanner: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/blue_bird_scanner).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request permission for Bluetooth usage:

```xml
<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires Bluetooth access to connect to devices.</string>
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires location access to discover Bluetooth devices.</string>
```

## Using the Package
Once you have installed the package and configured the necessary permissions, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement Bluetooth scanning.

# Complete Example of Using blue_bird_scanner

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:blue_bird_scanner/blue_bird_scanner.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  List<BluetoothDevice> devices = []; // List to hold discovered devices
  final BlueBirdScanner _scanner = BlueBirdScanner(); // Instance of the scanner

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _startScanning(); // Start scanning for devices when the app initializes
  }

  void _startScanning() async {
    // Start scanning for Bluetooth devices
    _scanner.startScan().listen((device) {
      // Listen for discovered devices
      setState(() {
        devices.add(device); // Add discovered device to the list
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _scanner.stopScan(); // Stop scanning when the widget is disposed
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Bluetooth Scanner'),
        ),
        body: ListView.builder(
          itemCount: devices.length, // Number of discovered devices
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            return ListTile(
              title: Text(devices[index].name), // Display device name
              subtitle: Text(devices[index].address), // Display device address
              onTap: () {
                // Handle device tap for connection
                _connectToDevice(devices[index]);
              },
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void _connectToDevice(BluetoothDevice device) async {
    // Connect to the selected Bluetooth device
    await _scanner.connect(device);
    // Handle successful connection (e.g., navigate to another screen)
  }
}
```

// The above code demonstrates a simple Bluetooth scanner application using the blue_bird_scanner package.
// 1. The app initializes and starts scanning for Bluetooth devices in the _startScanning method.
// 2. Discovered devices are added to the devices list and displayed in a ListView.
// 3. When a device is tapped, the _connectToDevice method is called to connect to the selected device.
// 4. The app stops scanning when the widget is disposed to free up resources.
