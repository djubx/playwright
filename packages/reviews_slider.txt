# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Reviews Slider Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the **reviews_slider** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  reviews_slider: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Reviews Slider
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the **reviews_slider** in your app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:reviews_slider/reviews_slider.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Reviews Slider Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ReviewsSlider(
            reviews: [
              Review(
                userName: 'John Doe',
                userReview: 'This product is amazing! Highly recommend it.',
                rating: 5,
              ),
              Review(
                userName: 'Jane Smith',
                userReview: 'Good quality, but could be improved.',
                rating: 4,
              ),
              Review(
                userName: 'Alice Johnson',
                userReview: 'Not what I expected, but decent overall.',
                rating: 3,
              ),
            ],
            autoPlay: true,
            autoPlayInterval: Duration(seconds: 3),
            indicatorColor: Colors.blue,
            indicatorActiveColor: Colors.red,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that uses the **reviews_slider** package to display a list of reviews. The `ReviewsSlider` widget takes a list of `Review` objects, each containing a username, review text, and rating.

            ],
            autoPlay: true, // Enables automatic sliding of reviews
            autoPlayInterval: Duration(seconds: 3), // Duration between slides
            indicatorColor: Colors.blue, // Color of the inactive indicators
            indicatorActiveColor: Colors.red, // Color of the active indicator
          ),
