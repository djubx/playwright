# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `mrx_charts`

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `mrx_charts` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `mrx_charts` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  mrx_charts: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to create a line chart using `mrx_charts`.

<!-- END_TUTORIAL -->

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mrx_charts/mrx_charts.dart'; // Import the mrx_charts package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'MRX Charts Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('MRX Charts Example'), // App bar title
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: LineChartWidget(), // Display the LineChartWidget
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class LineChartWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample data for the line chart
    final data = [
      ChartData(x: 1, y: 5),
      ChartData(x: 2, y: 10),
      ChartData(x: 3, y: 15),
      ChartData(x: 4, y: 20),
      ChartData(x: 5, y: 25),
    ];

    return LineChart(
      data: data, // Pass the data to the LineChart
      xAxisLabel: 'X Axis', // Label for the X-axis
      yAxisLabel: 'Y Axis', // Label for the Y-axis
      title: 'Sample Line Chart', // Title of the chart
      lineColor: Colors.blue, // Color of the line
      pointColor: Colors.red, // Color of the data points
      animationDuration: Duration(seconds: 1), // Animation duration for chart updates
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds the LineChartWidget.
// 4. The LineChartWidget creates sample data and passes it to the LineChart widget.
// 5. The LineChart widget displays the data as a line chart with specified labels, colors, and animation.
```
<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application that displays a line chart using the `mrx_charts` package. The application flow is straightforward: it initializes the app, sets up the UI with an AppBar and a centered line chart, and finally renders the chart with sample data.

### Summary

The `mrx_charts` package provides a robust solution for integrating charts into Flutter applications. With its easy setup, customizable features, and support for various chart types, developers can create engaging data visualizations that enhance user experience. The example provided demonstrates how to implement a basic line chart, but the package supports many more features and chart types that can be explored further.
