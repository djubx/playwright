# Complete Example of Gradient Circular Progress Indicator

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gradient_circular_progress_indicator/gradient_circular_progress_indicator.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Gradient Circular Progress Indicator Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Gradient Circular Progress Indicator'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: GradientCircularProgressIndicator(
            // Setting the gradient colors for the progress indicator
            gradient: LinearGradient(
              colors: [Colors.blue, Colors.purple],
            ),
            // Setting the current progress value
            value: 0.7, // 70% progress
            // Setting the width of the stroke
            strokeWidth: 10.0,
            // Setting the background color of the indicator
            backgroundColor: Colors.grey[300],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Gradient Circular Progress Indicator".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains the GradientCircularProgressIndicator widget.
// 5. The GradientCircularProgressIndicator is configured with a gradient, a value of 0.7 (70% progress), a stroke width of 10.0, and a background color.
// 6. The app displays a circular progress indicator with a gradient effect, indicating that 70% of the task is complete.
