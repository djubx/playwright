# Shadow Widget: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the shadow_widget package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  shadow_widget: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/shadow_widget).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to support the shadow effects properly:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, no additional configuration is required. Just ensure that your project is set up to use the latest version of Flutter.

## Basic Usage
To use the shadow_widget package, wrap your desired widget with the `ShadowWidget` class. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:shadow_widget/shadow_widget.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Shadow Widget Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ShadowWidget(
          shadowColor: Colors.black.withOpacity(0.5),
          blurRadius: 10.0,
          offset: Offset(5, 5),
          child: Container(
            width: 100,
            height: 100,
            color: Colors.blue,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a blue square with a shadow effect. You can customize the `shadowColor`, `blurRadius`, and `offset` properties to achieve the desired look.

# Complete Example of Shadow Widget

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:shadow_widget/shadow_widget.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Shadow Widget Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Shadow Widget Example')),
      body: Center(
        // Wrapping the Container with ShadowWidget to apply shadow effects
        child: ShadowWidget(
          shadowColor: Colors.black.withOpacity(0.5), // Setting shadow color
          blurRadius: 10.0, // Setting the blur radius of the shadow
          offset: Offset(5, 5), // Setting the offset of the shadow
          child: Container(
            width: 100, // Width of the container
            height: 100, // Height of the container
            color: Colors.blue, // Background color of the container
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a ShadowWidget wraps a Container.
// 5. The ShadowWidget applies a shadow effect to the Container, which is a blue square.
// 6. The shadow properties (color, blur, and offset) are customizable, enhancing the visual appeal of the app.
