# Tutorial: Setting Up the Flutter Snake Navigation Bar

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_snake_navigationbar` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_snake_navigationbar` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_snake_navigationbar: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_snake_navigationbar).

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_snake_navigationbar/flutter_snake_navigationbar.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Navigation Bar

You can now use the `SnakeNavigationBar` widget in your application. Below is a simple example of how to implement it.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_snake_navigationbar/flutter_snake_navigationbar.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  int _selectedIndex = 0;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Snake Navigation Bar Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Selected Index: $_selectedIndex'),
      ),
      bottomNavigationBar: SnakeNavigationBar.color(
        snakeViewColor: Colors.blue,
        selectedColor: Colors.white,
        unselectedColor: Colors.grey,
        backgroundColor: Colors.black,
        items: [
          BottomNavigationBarItem(icon: Icon(Icons.home), label: 'Home'),
          BottomNavigationBarItem(icon: Icon(Icons.search), label: 'Search'),
          BottomNavigationBarItem(icon: Icon(Icons.notifications), label: 'Notifications'),
          BottomNavigationBarItem(icon: Icon(Icons.person), label: 'Profile'),
        ],
        currentIndex: _selectedIndex,
        onTap: (index) {
          setState(() {
            _selectedIndex = index;
          });
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple application with a snake navigation bar at the bottom. The selected index is displayed in the center of the screen.

# Complete Example of the Snake Navigation Bar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_snake_navigationbar/flutter_snake_navigationbar.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to keep track of the selected index
  int _selectedIndex = 0;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Snake Navigation Bar Example')),
      body: Center(
        // Display the currently selected index
        child: Text('Selected Index: $_selectedIndex'),
      ),
      bottomNavigationBar: SnakeNavigationBar.color(
        // Customize the snake view color
        snakeViewColor: Colors.blue,
        // Set the color for the selected item
        selectedColor: Colors.white,
        // Set the color for unselected items
        unselectedColor: Colors.grey,
        // Set the background color of the navigation bar
        backgroundColor: Colors.black,
        // Define the items in the navigation bar
        items: [
          BottomNavigationBarItem(icon: Icon(Icons.home), label: 'Home'),
          BottomNavigationBarItem(icon: Icon(Icons.search), label: 'Search'),
          BottomNavigationBarItem(icon: Icon(Icons.notifications), label: 'Notifications'),
          BottomNavigationBarItem(icon: Icon(Icons.person), label: 'Profile'),
        ],
        // Set the current index to highlight the selected item
        currentIndex: _selectedIndex,
        // Handle tap events on the navigation items
        onTap: (index) {
          setState(() {
            // Update the selected index
            _selectedIndex = index;
          });
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application starts here
void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    home: RealFlutter(),
  ));
}

/*
  Application Flow Explanation:
  1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
  2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the selected index.
  3. The Scaffold widget provides the basic structure of the app, including an AppBar and a body.
  4. The body displays the currently selected index in the center of the screen.
  5. The SnakeNavigationBar is placed at the bottom, with customized colors and items.
  6. When a user taps on a navigation item, the onTap callback updates the selected index.
  7. The UI is rebuilt to reflect the new selected index, highlighting the selected item in the navigation bar.
