# Overview of the `wayland_layer_shell` Flutter Package

The `wayland_layer_shell` package is a Flutter plugin designed to facilitate the integration of Layer Shell protocols in applications running on Wayland compositors. This package is particularly useful for developers looking to create applications that require advanced window management features, such as overlays and pop-ups, in a Wayland environment.

## When to Use This Package
You should consider using the `wayland_layer_shell` package when:
- You are developing applications that need to run on Wayland compositors.
- You require advanced window management capabilities, such as creating floating windows or overlays.
- You want to enhance the user experience with dynamic and interactive UI elements that can be layered over other applications.

## Key Features
- **Layer Management**: Easily manage different layers of windows, allowing for overlays and pop-ups.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapt your application’s UI based on the layer's visibility and position.
- **Wayland Compatibility**: Specifically designed to work seamlessly with Wayland compositors, ensuring optimal performance and integration.

By leveraging the `wayland_layer_shell` package, developers can create sophisticated user interfaces that enhance the overall experience of their applications on Wayland systems.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `wayland_layer_shell`

## Installation
To get started with the `wayland_layer_shell` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and include the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  wayland_layer_shell: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/wayland_layer_shell).

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions and configurations to support Wayland. You may need to adjust your build settings to target the appropriate SDK versions.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your project is set up to support Wayland applications. This may involve configuring your Xcode project settings to include the necessary libraries and frameworks.

## Basic Usage
Once you have installed the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Here’s a simple example of how to initialize and create a layer shell:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:wayland_layer_shell/wayland_layer_shell.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: LayerShellExample(),
    );
  }
}

class LayerShellExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _LayerShellExampleState createState() => _LayerShellExampleState();
}

class _LayerShellExampleState extends State<LayerShellExample> {
  LayerShell? layerShell;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the LayerShell
    layerShell = LayerShell();
    layerShell?.initialize();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Wayland Layer Shell Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Create a new layer
            layerShell?.createLayer();
          },
          child: Text('Create Layer'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize the `LayerShell` and create a button that, when pressed, creates a new layer.

# Complete Example of `wayland_layer_shell`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:wayland_layer_shell/wayland_layer_shell.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  LayerShell? layerShell; // Declare a LayerShell instance

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    layerShell = LayerShell(); // Initialize the LayerShell
    layerShell?.initialize(); // Call the initialize method
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Wayland Layer Shell Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Create a new layer when the button is pressed
              layerShell?.createLayer();
            },
            child: Text('Create Layer'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that manages the state of the application.
// 3. In the initState method, we create an instance of LayerShell and initialize it.
// 4. The build method returns a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, we have an ElevatedButton that, when pressed, calls the createLayer method on the LayerShell instance.
// 6. This creates a new layer in the Wayland environment, demonstrating the package's functionality.
