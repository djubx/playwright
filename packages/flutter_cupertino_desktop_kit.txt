# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_cupertino_desktop_kit

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_cupertino_desktop_kit` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Installation

To get started, you need to add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_cupertino_desktop_kit: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_cupertino_desktop_kit).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### For iOS
- Ensure that your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`.
- You may need to configure your app's Info.plist to support specific features or permissions required by your application.

### For Desktop
- Make sure you have the necessary desktop environment set up. You can run your Flutter app on macOS, Windows, or Linux.
- Test your application on different screen sizes to ensure that the responsive design features of the package are functioning as expected.

## Basic Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the `flutter_cupertino_desktop_kit` package in your Flutter application:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_cupertino_desktop_kit/flutter_cupertino_desktop_kit.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return CupertinoApp(
      home: CupertinoPageScaffold(
        navigationBar: CupertinoNavigationBar(
          middle: Text('Cupertino Desktop Kit Example'),
        ),
        child: Center(
          child: CupertinoButton(
            child: Text('Press Me'),
            onPressed: () {
              // Action when button is pressed
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Cupertino application with a navigation bar and a button. The button can be configured to perform any action when pressed.

With this setup, you are ready to start building your application using the `flutter_cupertino_desktop_kit` package!

# Complete Example: A Functional Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_cupertino_desktop_kit/flutter_cupertino_desktop_kit.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return CupertinoApp(
      // The main entry point of the Cupertino application
      home: CupertinoPageScaffold(
        // Scaffold for the Cupertino page
        navigationBar: CupertinoNavigationBar(
          // Navigation bar at the top of the page
          middle: Text('Cupertino Desktop Kit Example'),
        ),
        child: Center(
          // Center widget to align the button in the middle of the screen
          child: CupertinoButton(
            // Cupertino-styled button
            child: Text('Press Me'),
            onPressed: () {
              // Action when button is pressed
              showDialog(
                context: context,
                builder: (context) {
                  return CupertinoAlertDialog(
                    // Alert dialog to show a message
                    title: Text('Hello!'),
                    content: Text('You pressed the button!'),
                    actions: [
                      CupertinoDialogAction(
                        // Action button to dismiss the dialog
                        child: Text('OK'),
                        onPressed: () {
                          Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                        },
                      ),
                    ],
                  );
                },
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a CupertinoApp, which is the main entry point for the app.
// 3. Inside the CupertinoApp, a CupertinoPageScaffold is created, which provides a structure for the page.
// 4. A CupertinoNavigationBar is added to the top of the page, displaying the title 'Cupertino Desktop Kit Example'.
// 5. The child of the scaffold is a Center widget that contains a CupertinoButton.
// 6. When the button is pressed, a CupertinoAlertDialog is displayed, showing a message and an OK button.
// 7. Pressing the OK button dismisses the dialog, returning the user to the main screen.
