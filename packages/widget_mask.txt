This package is particularly useful when you want to create custom shapes, overlays, or effects that go beyond the standard widget capabilities in Flutter.

## When to Use Widget Mask

You might consider using the **widget_mask** package in scenarios such as:
- Creating custom-shaped buttons or cards.
- Implementing overlays with specific shapes for visual effects.
- Designing unique UI components that require masking for aesthetic purposes.

## Features

- **Custom Shapes**: Easily create widgets with non-rectangular shapes.
- **Flexible Masking**: Apply masks to any widget, allowing for creative designs.
- **Performance Optimizations**: The package is designed to be efficient, ensuring smooth performance even with complex masks.

Overall, the **widget_mask** package enhances the visual capabilities of Flutter applications, making it easier to implement creative designs without compromising performance.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Widget Mask

## Step 1: Adding Dependency

To get started with the **widget_mask** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  widget_mask: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/widget_mask).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:widget_mask/widget_mask.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using Widget Mask

You can now use the **widget_mask** package in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to apply a mask to a widget:

```dart
WidgetMask(
  mask: Container(
    color: Colors.red,
    child: Center(child: Text('Masked Widget')),
  ),
  child: Container(
    color: Colors.blue,
    width: 200,
    height: 200,
  ),
);
```

This code creates a blue square with a red mask in the center, demonstrating how to use the package effectively.

# Complete Example of Widget Mask

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:widget_mask/widget_mask.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Widget Mask Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Widget Mask Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: WidgetMask(
            // The mask widget that defines the shape
            mask: Container(
              color: Colors.red, // Color of the mask
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'Masked Widget', // Text inside the mask
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
                ),
              ),
            ),
            // The child widget that will be masked
            child: Container(
              color: Colors.blue, // Background color of the child
              width: 200, // Width of the child
              height: 200, // Height of the child
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a WidgetMask is created.
// 5. The mask property defines the shape and appearance of the mask, which is a red container with centered text.
// 6. The child property is a blue container that will be masked by the red container.
// 7. The result is a blue square with a red mask in the center, displaying the text "Masked Widget".
```

// Final Summary:
// The application starts with the main function, which initializes the Flutter app. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp containing a Scaffold. Inside the Scaffold, a WidgetMask is used to create a masked effect. The mask is defined by a red container with text, while the child is a blue square. This demonstrates how to use the **widget_mask** package to create visually appealing UI components in Flutter.
