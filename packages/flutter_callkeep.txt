<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Flutter CallKeep: A Comprehensive Overview

The `flutter_callkeep` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to implement VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) functionalities in their applications. This package allows you to manage incoming and outgoing calls, providing a native call interface that integrates seamlessly with both Android and iOS platforms.

## When to Use `flutter_callkeep`

You should consider using `flutter_callkeep` in scenarios such as:
- Building a VoIP application where users can make and receive calls over the internet.
- Creating a communication app that requires a native call interface, similar to traditional phone calls.
- Implementing features like call hold, mute, and speakerphone in your Flutter application.

## Key Features

- **Native Call UI**: Provides a native interface for incoming and outgoing calls, ensuring a familiar user experience.
- **Call Management**: Allows you to manage call states (e.g., ringing, answered, ended) effectively.
- **Support for Multiple Calls**: Handles multiple calls simultaneously, enabling users to switch between calls.
- **Customizable**: Offers options to customize the call interface and behavior according to your app's needs.

With these features, `flutter_callkeep` is an essential package for any Flutter developer aiming to create a robust communication application.

# Setting Up and Using Flutter CallKeep

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_callkeep` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_callkeep` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_callkeep: ^4.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CALL_PHONE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE"/>
```

2. **Service Declaration**: Also, declare the service in the same file:

```xml
<service android:name="com.oney.WebRTCModule.CallKeepService" android:permission="android.permission.BIND_JOB_SERVICE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Info.plist**: Open your `Info.plist` file and add the following keys:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for calls</string>
<key>NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to Bluetooth for calls</string>
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>voip</string>
</array>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that we have set up the package, let’s implement a simple call management system.

### Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_callkeep/flutter_callkeep.dart';
```

### Initializing CallKeep

You need to initialize the `flutter_callkeep` in your main application file:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
  CallKeep.setup(
    <String, dynamic>{
      'ios': {
        'appName': 'Your App Name',
      },
      'android': {
        'alertTitle': 'Permissions required',
        'alertDescription': 'This application needs to access your phone accounts',
        'cancelButton': 'Cancel',
        'okButton': 'OK',
      },
    },
  );
}
```

### Handling Incoming Calls

You can handle incoming calls by listening to events:

```dart
CallKeep.onCallReceived.listen((event) {
  // Handle incoming call
});
```

# Complete Example of Flutter CallKeep

Here’s a complete example demonstrating the use of `flutter_callkeep` in a Flutter application.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_callkeep/flutter_callkeep.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
  // Initialize CallKeep with necessary configurations
  CallKeep.setup(
    <String, dynamic>{
      'ios': {
        'appName': 'RealFlutter',
      },
      'android': {
        'alertTitle': 'Permissions required',
        'alertDescription': 'This application needs to access your phone accounts',
        'cancelButton': 'Cancel',
        'okButton': 'OK',
      },
    },
  );

  // Listen for incoming calls
  CallKeep.onCallReceived.listen((event) {
    // Handle incoming call event
    print('Incoming call: ${event['callUUID']}');
  });
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter CallKeep Example',
      home: CallScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class CallScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CallScreenState createState() => _CallScreenState();
}

class _CallScreenState extends State<CallScreen> {
  String _callUUID = '';

  // Function to start a call
  void _startCall() {
    // Generate a unique call UUID
    _callUUID = 'call-uuid-${DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch}';
    
    // Start the call using CallKeep
    CallKeep.startCall(
      _callUUID,
      'Caller Name',
      'caller_number',
      'https://example.com/caller_avatar.png', // Optional avatar URL
    );
  }

  // Function to end a call
  void _endCall() {
    CallKeep.endCall(_callUUID);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('CallKeep Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _startCall,
              child: Text('Start Call'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _endCall,
              child: Text('End Call'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app initializes and sets up CallKeep with necessary configurations.
// 2. It listens for incoming calls and prints the call UUID when a call is received.
// 3. The CallScreen widget provides buttons to start and end calls.
// 4. When the "Start Call" button is pressed, a unique call UUID is generated, and the call is initiated.
// 5. The "End Call" button ends the ongoing call using the stored call UUID.
```
