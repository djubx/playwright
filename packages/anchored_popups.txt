# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Anchored Popups

## Installation
To get started with the `anchored_popups` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  anchored_popups: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No specific configurations are required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your popups require any specific permissions (like location access). However, for basic usage, no additional configurations are necessary.

## Using the Package
To use the `anchored_popups` package, you will typically follow these steps:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:
   ```dart
   import 'package:anchored_popups/anchored_popups.dart';
   ```

2. Create a widget that will serve as the anchor for your popup.

3. Use the `AnchoredPopup` widget to create and display the popup.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement an anchored popup:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:anchored_popups/anchored_popups.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Anchored Popups Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Show the popup when the button is pressed
              showAnchoredPopup(context);
            },
            child: Text('Show Popup'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void showAnchoredPopup(BuildContext context) {
    // Define the popup content
    final popup = Popup(
      child: Container(
        padding: EdgeInsets.all(10),
        color: Colors.blue,
        child: Text('This is an anchored popup!', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white)),
      ),
    );

    // Show the popup anchored to the button
    showPopup(
      context: context,
      popup: popup,
      anchor: Offset(0, 0), // Adjust the anchor point as needed
    );
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to create a simple button that, when pressed, displays an anchored popup with a message.

# Complete Example of Anchored Popups

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:anchored_popups/anchored_popups.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Anchored Popups Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Show the popup when the button is pressed
              showAnchoredPopup(context);
            },
            child: Text('Show Popup'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void showAnchoredPopup(BuildContext context) {
    // Define the popup content
    final popup = Popup(
      child: Container(
        padding: EdgeInsets.all(10),
        color: Colors.blue,
        child: Text('This is an anchored popup!', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white)),
      ),
    );

    // Show the popup anchored to the button
    showPopup(
      context: context,
      popup: popup,
      anchor: Offset(0, 0), // Adjust the anchor point as needed
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which builds a MaterialApp.
// 2. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. The Center widget contains an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the showAnchoredPopup method is called.
// 5. The showAnchoredPopup method creates a Popup widget with a message.
// 6. The popup is displayed anchored to the button using the showPopup function.
// 7. The popup appears with a blue background and white text, providing contextual information to the user.
