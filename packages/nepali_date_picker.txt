}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {

      title: 'Nepali Date Picker Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: DatePickerHome(),
    );
  }
}

class DatePickerHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DatePickerHomeState createState() => _DatePickerHomeState();
}

class _DatePickerHomeState extends State<DatePickerHome> {
  // Variable to hold the selected date
  NepaliDateTime? selectedDate;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Nepali Date Picker'),

      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the selected date
            Text(
              selectedDate != null
                  ? 'Selected Date: ${selectedDate!.toString()}'
                  : 'No Date Selected',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to open the Nepali date picker
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () async {
                // Show the Nepali date picker
                final date = await showNepaliDatePicker(
                  context: context,
                  initialDate: NepaliDateTime.now(),
                  firstDate: NepaliDateTime(2070, 1, 1),
                  lastDate: NepaliDateTime(2099, 12, 30),
                );
                // Update the state with the selected date
                if (date != null) {
                  setState(() {
                    selectedDate = date;
                  });
                }
              },
              child: Text('Pick a Date'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
// Explanation of the application flow:

// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of the MaterialApp is set to DatePickerHome, which is a stateful widget.
// 4. In the DatePickerHome widget, we define a variable selectedDate to hold the user's selected date.
// 5. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget containing a Column.
// 6. The Column displays the selected date or a message indicating no date has been selected.
// 7. An ElevatedButton is provided to open the Nepali date picker when pressed.
// 8. When the button is pressed, the showNepaliDatePicker function is called, allowing the user to select a date.
// 9. If a date is selected, the state is updated, and the selected date is displayed on the screen.
```
