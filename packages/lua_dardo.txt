# Overview of the lua_dardo Flutter Package

The `lua_dardo` package is a powerful tool for integrating Lua scripting capabilities into Flutter applications. This package allows developers to execute Lua scripts, enabling dynamic behavior and customization within their apps. It is particularly useful for applications that require scripting capabilities, such as games, educational apps, or any application that benefits from runtime code execution.

## When to Use lua_dardo
- **Game Development**: For games that require dynamic content or behavior changes without recompiling the app.
- **Educational Apps**: To allow users to write and execute Lua scripts for learning purposes.
- **Customizable Applications**: When you want to provide users with the ability to modify app behavior through scripts.

## Key Features
- **Lua Scripting**: Execute Lua scripts directly within your Flutter app.
- **Interoperability**: Seamlessly call Dart functions from Lua and vice versa.
- **Performance**: Efficient execution of Lua scripts with minimal overhead.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS platforms.

The `lua_dardo` package opens up a world of possibilities for Flutter developers looking to enhance their applications with scripting capabilities.

# Setting Up and Using lua_dardo

## Installation
To add the `lua_dardo` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  lua_dardo: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode.
2. Ensure that your deployment target is set to at least iOS 10.0.

## Basic Usage
To use the `lua_dardo` package, you need to create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class, load a Lua script, and execute it. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:lua_dardo/lua_dardo.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  LuaState luaState;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    luaState = LuaState();
    luaState.execute('print("Hello from Lua!")'); // Example Lua execution
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Lua Dardo Example')),
        body: Center(child: Text('Check your console for Lua output')),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code initializes a Lua state and executes a simple Lua print command. You can expand this by adding more complex Lua scripts and interacting with Dart functions.

# Complete Example of lua_dardo in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:lua_dardo/lua_dardo.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  LuaState luaState; // Declare a LuaState variable
  String luaOutput = ""; // Variable to hold output from Lua

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    luaState = LuaState(); // Initialize Lua state
    // Define a Lua script that adds two numbers
    String luaScript = '''
      function add(a, b)
        return a + b
      end
      return add(5, 3) -- Call the add function
    ''';
    // Execute the Lua script and get the result
    luaOutput = luaState.execute(luaScript).toString();
    // Update the state to reflect the Lua output
    setState(() {});
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Lua Dardo Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Lua Output: $luaOutput'), // Display Lua output
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The RealFlutter widget is created, which initializes the Lua state in initState().
// 2. A Lua script is defined that contains a function to add two numbers.
// 3. The script is executed, and the result is stored in the luaOutput variable.
// 4. setState() is called to update the UI with the Lua output.
// 5. The output is displayed in the center of the screen when the app runs.

### Summary
In this blog post, we explored the `lua_dardo` Flutter package, which allows for the integration of Lua scripting into Flutter applications. We covered the installation process, platform-specific configurations, and provided a complete example demonstrating how to execute Lua scripts and display their output in a Flutter app. This package is particularly useful for developers looking to add dynamic scripting capabilities to their applications, enhancing user experience and flexibility.
