```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:outline_material_icons/outline_material_icons.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a Material App with a home page
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Outline Material Icons Demo',
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a Scaffold with a body
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Outline Material Icons Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        // Use the Icon widget to display an outline material icon
        child: Icon(
          OMIcons.menu, // This is the outline material menu icon
          size: 100, // Set the size of the icon
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// This is the main entry point of the application.
// The RealFlutter class is a stateless widget that creates a Material App with a home page.
// The home page is a Scaffold with a body that displays an outline material icon.
// The Icon widget is used to display the outline material menu icon.
// The size of the icon is set to 100.

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class creates a Material App with a home page.
// 3. The home page is displayed, which is a Scaffold with a body.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold displays an outline material icon using the Icon widget.
// 5. The user can view the outline material icon.
