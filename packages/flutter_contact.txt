# Flutter Contact Package: A Comprehensive Overview

The `flutter_contact` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to integrate contact management features into their applications. This package allows you to access and manipulate the user's contact list, making it ideal for applications that require user interaction with contacts, such as messaging apps, social networks, or any app that needs to display or manage contact information.

## When to Use `flutter_contact`

You should consider using `flutter_contact` when:
- You need to display a list of contacts in your app.
- You want to allow users to add, edit, or delete contacts.
- Your application requires searching through contacts or accessing specific contact details.

## Key Features
- **Access Contacts**: Retrieve the user's contact list with ease.
- **Add/Edit/Delete Contacts**: Modify the contact list directly from your app.
- **Search Functionality**: Implement search features to find specific contacts quickly.
- **Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.

With these features, `flutter_contact` provides a comprehensive solution for managing contacts in Flutter applications.

# Setting Up and Using the `flutter_contact` Package

## Installation

To get started with the `flutter_contact` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_contact: ^0.6.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_CONTACTS"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_CONTACTS"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request permission to access contacts:

```xml
<key>NSContactsUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your contacts.</string>
```

## Basic Usage

To use the `flutter_contact` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_contact/flutter_contact.dart';
```

You can then use the package to access and manipulate contacts. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to fetch contacts:

```dart
Future<void> fetchContacts() async {
  // Request permission to access contacts
  var status = await FlutterContact.requestPermission();
  if (status.isGranted) {
    // Fetch contacts if permission is granted
    List<Contact> contacts = await FlutterContact.getContacts();
    // Do something with the contacts
  }
}
```

This setup allows you to start integrating contact management features into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using `flutter_contact`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_contact/flutter_contact.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Contact Example',
      home: ContactListScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ContactListScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ContactListScreenState createState() => _ContactListScreenState();
}

class _ContactListScreenState extends State<ContactListScreen> {
  List<Contact> _contacts = []; // List to hold contacts

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _fetchContacts(); // Fetch contacts when the screen initializes
  }

  Future<void> _fetchContacts() async {
    // Request permission to access contacts
    var status = await FlutterContact.requestPermission();
    if (status.isGranted) {
      // Fetch contacts if permission is granted
      List<Contact> contacts = await FlutterContact.getContacts();
      setState(() {
        _contacts = contacts; // Update the state with fetched contacts
      });
    } else {
      // Handle permission denied case
      print('Permission denied');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Contacts'),
      ),
      body: _contacts.isEmpty
          ? Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator()) // Show loading indicator
          : ListView.builder(
              itemCount: _contacts.length,
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                // Build a list of contacts
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text(_contacts[index].displayName ?? 'No Name'),
                  subtitle: Text(_contacts[index].phones.isNotEmpty
                      ? _contacts[index].phones.first.number
                      : 'No Phone'),
                );
              },
            ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets the home to ContactListScreen.
// 3. In ContactListScreen, the state is initialized, and _fetchContacts is called to get the user's contacts.
// 4. _fetchContacts requests permission to access contacts. If granted, it fetches the contacts and updates the state.
// 5. The build method checks if the contacts list is empty. If it is, a loading indicator is shown.
// 6. Once contacts are fetched, a ListView is built displaying each contact's name and phone number.
