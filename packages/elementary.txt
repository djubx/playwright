Here's a detailed technical blog on the "elementary" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Overview of the Elementary Flutter Package

The **elementary** package is a powerful state management solution for Flutter applications, designed to simplify the development process by providing a clear architecture and reducing boilerplate code. It is particularly useful for building complex applications where managing state can become cumbersome. 

## When to Use the Elementary Package

You should consider using the elementary package when:
- You are developing a medium to large-scale Flutter application that requires a robust state management solution.
- You want to implement a clean architecture that separates business logic from UI code.
- You need to manage multiple states and events efficiently without excessive boilerplate.

## Key Features
- **Separation of Concerns**: The package promotes a clear separation between UI and business logic, making your codebase easier to maintain.
- **Reactive Programming**: It leverages reactive programming principles, allowing your UI to automatically update in response to state changes.
- **Built-in Dependency Injection**: Elementary provides a simple way to manage dependencies, making it easier to test and maintain your application.
- **Support for Multiple Platforms**: The package is designed to work seamlessly on both Android and iOS, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.

In summary, the elementary package is an excellent choice for Flutter developers looking to implement a clean and efficient architecture in their applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Elementary Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the elementary package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  elementary: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the elementary package. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

To use the elementary package, you will typically create a `ViewModel` that extends `Elementary` and a corresponding `Widget` that listens to the state changes. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:elementary/elementary.dart';

class RealFlutter extends ElementaryWidget<MyModel> {
  RealFlutter({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, MyModel model) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Elementary Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Current Count: ${model.count}'),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: model.increment,
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MyModel extends ElementaryModel {
  int count = 0;

  void increment() {
    count++;
    notifyListeners(); // Notify listeners to update the UI
  }
}
```

In this example, `RealFlutter` is the main widget that displays the current count and a button to increment it. The `MyModel` class manages the state.

## Step 4: Running the Application

Once you have set up your application, you can run it on an emulator or a physical device using:

```bash
flutter run
```

This will launch your Flutter application, and you should see the UI reflecting the state managed by the elementary package.

# Complete Example of Using the Elementary Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:elementary/elementary.dart';

// Main entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// MyApp widget that sets up the MaterialApp
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Elementary Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(), // Set the home to our RealFlutter widget
    );
  }
}

// RealFlutter widget that extends ElementaryWidget
class RealFlutter extends ElementaryWidget<MyModel> {
  RealFlutter({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, MyModel model) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Elementary Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Current Count: ${model.count}'), // Display current count
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: model.increment, // Increment count on button press
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// MyModel class that extends ElementaryModel
class MyModel extends ElementaryModel {
  int count = 0; // Initial count

  // Method to increment the count
  void increment() {
    count++; // Increase count by 1
    notifyListeners(); // Notify listeners to update the UI
  }
}

// Application flow explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which runs MyApp.
// 2. MyApp sets up a MaterialApp with a title and theme, and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter extends ElementaryWidget and builds a UI with a Scaffold.
// 4. The UI displays the current count and has a FloatingActionButton to increment the count.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the increment method in MyModel is called, which updates the count and notifies listeners.
// 6. The UI automatically updates to reflect the new count due to the reactive nature of the elementary package.
```
