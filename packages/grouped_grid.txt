# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `grouped_grid`

## Installation
To get started with the `grouped_grid` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  grouped_grid: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/grouped_grid).

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No specific configurations are required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the latest version of Xcode installed. No additional configurations are necessary for using `grouped_grid`.

## Basic Usage
To use the `grouped_grid` package, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:
   ```dart
   import 'package:grouped_grid/grouped_grid.dart';
   ```

2. Create a list of items that you want to display in the grid. Each item can have a category for grouping.

3. Use the `GroupedGridView` widget to display your items.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
GroupedGridView(
  gridDelegate: SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount(
    crossAxisCount: 2,
  ),
  items: items, // Your list of items
  groupBy: (item) => item.category, // Grouping logic
  itemBuilder: (context, item) {
    return Card(
      child: Center(child: Text(item.name)),
    );
  },
);
```

This will create a grid view where items are grouped by their category, making it easy for users to navigate through them.

# Complete Example of Using `grouped_grid`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:grouped_grid/grouped_grid.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Grouped Grid Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Grouped Grid Example'),
        ),
        body: GroupedGridExample(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class GroupedGridExample extends StatelessWidget {
  // Sample data to display in the grid
  final List<Item> items = [
    Item(name: 'Apple', category: 'Fruits'),
    Item(name: 'Banana', category: 'Fruits'),
    Item(name: 'Carrot', category: 'Vegetables'),
    Item(name: 'Broccoli', category: 'Vegetables'),
    Item(name: 'Chicken', category: 'Meat'),
    Item(name: 'Beef', category: 'Meat'),
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return GroupedGridView(
      gridDelegate: SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount(
        crossAxisCount: 2, // Number of columns in the grid
      ),
      items: items, // The list of items to display
      groupBy: (item) => item.category, // Grouping items by category
      itemBuilder: (context, item) {
        return Card(
          child: Center(child: Text(item.name)), // Display item name
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

// Item class to represent each item in the grid
class Item {
  final String name;
  final String category;

  Item({required this.name, required this.category});
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a body that displays the GroupedGridExample widget.
4. GroupedGridExample creates a list of items, each with a name and category.
5. The GroupedGridView widget is used to display the items in a grid format.
6. The grid is configured to have 2 columns, and items are grouped by their category.
7. Each item is displayed in a Card widget, showing its name in the center.
8. The result is a visually organized grid layout that allows users to easily navigate through different categories of items.
