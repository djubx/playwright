# Tutorial: Setting Up the World Countries Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **world_countries** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **world_countries** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  world_countries: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that the package is set up, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to fetch and display country data.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:world_countries/world_countries.dart';
```

2. Use the `WorldCountries` class to access country data. You can fetch a list of all countries or get specific information about a country.

```dart
void main() {
  // Fetch all countries
  List<Country> countries = WorldCountries.countries;

  // Print the name and code of each country
  for (var country in countries) {
    print('${country.name} - ${country.alpha2Code}');
  }
}
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to retrieve a list of countries and print their names and ISO codes to the console.

# Complete Example: Flutter Application Using World Countries Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:world_countries/world_countries.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'World Countries',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: CountryListScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class CountryListScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Fetch all countries from the world_countries package
    List<Country> countries = WorldCountries.countries;

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('List of Countries'),
      ),
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: countries.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          // Display each country in a ListTile
          return ListTile(
            title: Text(countries[index].name), // Country name
            subtitle: Text(countries[index].alpha2Code), // Country code
            onTap: () {
              // Show a dialog with more information when tapped
              showDialog(
                context: context,
                builder: (context) {
                  return AlertDialog(
                    title: Text(countries[index].name),
                    content: Text('Code: ${countries[index].alpha2Code}\n'
                        'Currency: ${countries[index].currencies.first.name}\n'
                        'Language: ${countries[index].languages.first.name}'),
                    actions: [
                      TextButton(
                        onPressed: () {
                          Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                        },
                        child: Text('Close'),
                      ),
                    ],
                  );
                },
              );
            },
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home screen is set to CountryListScreen, which displays a list of countries.
// 4. In CountryListScreen, we fetch all countries using WorldCountries.countries.
// 5. A ListView.builder is used to create a scrollable list of countries.
// 6. Each country is displayed in a ListTile, showing its name and ISO code.
// 7. When a ListTile is tapped, an AlertDialog is shown with more details about the country, including its currency and language.
// 8. The user can close the dialog by pressing the 'Close' button.
```
