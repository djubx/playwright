// The app starts by initializing the Genetom Chess Engine.
// The engine is then passed to the MyApp widget, which builds the app's UI.
// The ChessBoard widget displays the current move and allows the user to make a move.
// When the user makes a move, the engine generates the next move and updates the board.

// The app's flow is as follows:
// 1. The user starts the app and the engine is initialized.
// 2. The user makes a move on the board.
// 3. The engine generates the next move and updates the board.
// 4. The user can continue making moves, and the engine will respond accordingly.
