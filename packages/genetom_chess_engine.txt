# Overview of the `genetom_chess_engine` Flutter Package

The `genetom_chess_engine` package is a powerful Flutter library designed for developers looking to integrate chess functionalities into their applications. This package provides a robust chess engine that can handle various chess-related tasks, including move generation, validation, and game state management. 

## When to Use This Package
You might consider using the `genetom_chess_engine` package in scenarios such as:
- Developing a chess game application with AI opponents.
- Creating a chess analysis tool that evaluates positions and suggests moves.
- Building educational tools for teaching chess strategies.

## Key Features
- **Move Generation**: Automatically generates legal moves for any given position.
- **Game State Management**: Keeps track of the game state, including the history of moves.
- **AI Integration**: Allows for the implementation of AI opponents with varying difficulty levels.
- **Customizable Rules**: Supports various chess rules and can be extended for custom chess variants.

This package is an excellent choice for developers looking to create engaging chess applications with minimal effort.

# Setting Up the `genetom_chess_engine` Package

## Installation
To get started with the `genetom_chess_engine` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  genetom_chess_engine: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/genetom_chess_engine).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Optimizations
- Ensure that you test the chess engine on both platforms to confirm that the performance is optimal.
- Consider using Flutter's `Provider` or `Riverpod` for state management to handle the chess game state effectively.

With the package installed and configured, you can now start using it in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using `genetom_chess_engine`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:genetom_chess_engine/genetom_chess_engine.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late ChessEngine _chessEngine; // Declare the chess engine
  String _boardState = ''; // Variable to hold the board state

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _chessEngine = ChessEngine(); // Initialize the chess engine
    _boardState = _chessEngine.getBoard(); // Get the initial board state
  }

  void _makeMove(String move) {
    // Make a move and update the board state
    if (_chessEngine.isMoveValid(move)) {
      _chessEngine.makeMove(move);
      setState(() {
        _boardState = _chessEngine.getBoard(); // Update the board state
      });
    } else {
      // Handle invalid move
      print('Invalid move: $move');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Chess Game')),
        body: Column(
          children: [
            Text('Current Board State:'),
            Text(_boardState), // Display the current board state
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () => _makeMove('e2e4'), // Example move
              child: Text('Make Move e2 to e4'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
// The above code creates a simple Flutter application that integrates the genetom_chess_engine package.
// 
// 1. The `main` function initializes the app by running the `RealFlutter` widget.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` class is a StatefulWidget that manages the chess engine and the board state.
// 3. In the `initState` method, the chess engine is initialized, and the initial board state is retrieved.
// 4. The `_makeMove` method checks if a move is valid and updates the board state accordingly.
// 5. The `build` method constructs the UI, displaying the current board state and a button to make a sample move (e2 to e4).
// 
// This example demonstrates how to set up the chess engine, manage the game state, and interact with the UI.
