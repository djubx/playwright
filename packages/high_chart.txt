# Tutorial: Setting Up High_Chart in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **high_chart** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **high_chart** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  high_chart: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Open the `Podfile` and uncomment the platform line, setting it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

After making these changes, run the following command to install the pods:

```bash
cd ios
pod install
```

## Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the **high_chart** package:

```dart
import 'package:high_chart/high_chart.dart';
```

## Step 4: Create a Simple Chart

Now, let's create a simple line chart. You can use the following code snippet to get started:

```dart
HighChart(
  chart: Chart(type: 'line'),
  title: Title(text: 'Sample Line Chart'),
  series: [
    Series(
      name: 'Data Series 1',
      data: [1, 3, 2, 4],
    ),
  ],
);
```

This code creates a basic line chart with a title and a single data series.

## Conclusion

You have now set up the **high_chart** package in your Flutter application and created a simple line chart. You can explore more features and customization options in the official documentation to enhance your charts further.

# Complete Example of High_Chart in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:high_chart/high_chart.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'High Chart Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('High Chart Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: HighChart(
            chart: Chart(type: 'line'), // Define the type of chart
            title: Title(text: 'Sample Line Chart'), // Set the title of the chart
            xAxis: XAxis(categories: ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr']), // Define categories for the x-axis
            yAxis: YAxis(title: Title(text: 'Values')), // Set the title for the y-axis
            series: [
              Series(
                name: 'Data Series 1', // Name of the data series
                data: [1, 3, 2, 4], // Data points for the series
              ),
              Series(
                name: 'Data Series 2', // Another data series
                data: [4, 3, 5, 2], // Data points for the second series
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'High Chart Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a HighChart widget.
// 5. The HighChart widget is configured to display a line chart with two data series.
// 6. The x-axis is labeled with months, and the y-axis represents values.
// 7. The chart is rendered in the center of the screen, showcasing the data visually.
```
