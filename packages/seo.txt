# Tutorial: Setting Up the SEO Flutter Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the SEO Flutter package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `seo` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  seo: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/seo).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### For Android

1. Open the `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file.
2. Ensure you have the necessary permissions and configurations for internet access.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### For iOS

1. Open the `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following configuration to allow your app to access the internet.

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set up SEO metadata.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:seo/seo.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'SEO Example',
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Set SEO metadata
    SEO.setTitle('My Flutter Web App');
    SEO.setDescription('This is a sample Flutter web application demonstrating SEO features.');
    SEO.setKeywords(['Flutter', 'SEO', 'Web Development']);
    
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('SEO Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to my Flutter web app!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we set the title, description, and keywords for our web application using the SEO package. This information will help search engines index the page correctly.

# Complete Example: SEO Flutter Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:seo/seo.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'SEO Example',
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Set SEO metadata
    SEO.setTitle('My Flutter Web App'); // Sets the title of the web page
    SEO.setDescription('This is a sample Flutter web application demonstrating SEO features.'); // Sets the description for search engines
    SEO.setKeywords(['Flutter', 'SEO', 'Web Development']); // Sets keywords for better indexing
    
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('SEO Example'), // Title displayed in the app bar
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to my Flutter web app!'), // Main content of the app
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with MyApp as the root widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home page (HomePage).
// 3. HomePage sets the SEO metadata using the SEO package.
// 4. The Scaffold widget provides a structure for the app, including an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. The Center widget contains a Text widget that displays a welcome message to the user.
// 6. The SEO metadata set in HomePage will help search engines index the page correctly, improving visibility.
