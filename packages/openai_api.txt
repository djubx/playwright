# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the OpenAI API Flutter Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `openai_api` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  openai_api: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Configuring for Android

For Android, you need to ensure that your app has internet permissions. Open the `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following line inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

## Step 3: Configuring for iOS

For iOS, you need to add the following to your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist` to allow network requests:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to initialize the OpenAI API and make a request.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:openai_api/openai_api.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('OpenAI API Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initialize the OpenAI API with your API key
              final openAI = OpenAI(apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY');

              // Make a request to the OpenAI API
              final response = await openAI.complete(
                prompt: 'What is the capital of France?',
                maxTokens: 5,
              );

              // Display the response
              print(response.choices.first.text);
            },
            child: Text('Get Answer'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize the OpenAI API with an API key and make a simple request to get the capital of France. The response is printed to the console.

# Complete Example: OpenAI API Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:openai_api/openai_api.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('OpenAI API Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initialize the OpenAI API with your API key
              final openAI = OpenAI(apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY');

              // Make a request to the OpenAI API
              final response = await openAI.complete(
                prompt: 'What is the capital of France?',
                maxTokens: 5,
              );

              // Display the response
              print(response.choices.first.text);
            },
            child: Text('Get Answer'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The MaterialApp widget is created, providing the app structure.
// 3. A Scaffold widget is used to create the basic visual layout, including an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the OpenAI API is initialized with the provided API key.
// 6. A request is made to the OpenAI API to get the capital of France.
// 7. The response from the API is printed to the console.
// 8. The user can see the result in the console when they press the button.
