# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using vocsy_epub_viewer

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `vocsy_epub_viewer` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  vocsy_epub_viewer: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/vocsy_epub_viewer).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    compileSdkVersion 31 // or latest
    ...
}

dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.3.1' // or latest
    ...
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `ios/Podfile`.
2. Ensure that you have the following configurations:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0' # or latest
```

3. Run `pod install` in the `ios` directory to install the necessary dependencies.

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `vocsy_epub_viewer` in your app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:vocsy_epub_viewer/vocsy_epub_viewer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'EPUB Viewer',
      home: EpubViewerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class EpubViewerScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('EPUB Viewer'),
      ),
      body: EpubView(
        filePath: 'assets/sample.epub', // Path to your EPUB file
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that displays an EPUB file. Make sure to place your EPUB file in the `assets` directory and declare it in your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/sample.epub
```

# Complete Example of vocsy_epub_viewer

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:vocsy_epub_viewer/vocsy_epub_viewer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Start the app with the main class RealFlutter
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'EPUB Viewer', // Title of the application
      home: EpubViewerScreen(), // Home screen of the app
    );
  }
}

class EpubViewerScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('EPUB Viewer'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: EpubView(
        filePath: 'assets/sample.epub', // Path to the EPUB file
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp has a title and sets the home to EpubViewerScreen.
// 4. The EpubViewerScreen class builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 5. The body contains the EpubView widget, which takes the filePath of the EPUB file.
// 6. The EPUB file is displayed in the app, allowing users to read the content seamlessly.
```
