# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Overflow Text Animated

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the `overflow_text_animated` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  overflow_text_animated: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the animated overflow text.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:overflow_text_animated/overflow_text_animated.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Overflow Text Animated Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: OverflowTextAnimated(
            text: 'This is an example of animated overflow text that will scroll if it is too long to fit in the available space.',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, color: Colors.black),
            duration: Duration(seconds: 5),
            repeat: true,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that uses the `OverflowTextAnimated` widget to display a long text string that scrolls across the screen.

# Complete Example of Overflow Text Animated

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:overflow_text_animated/overflow_text_animated.dart';

// Main class of the application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Overflow Text Animated Example'), // Title of the app
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: OverflowTextAnimated(
            text: 'This is an example of animated overflow text that will scroll if it is too long to fit in the available space.',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, color: Colors.black), // Text style
            duration: Duration(seconds: 5), // Duration of the animation
            repeat: true, // Repeat the animation
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp, which provides the basic structure for the app.
3. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold widget is created, which includes an AppBar and a Center widget.
4. The Center widget contains the OverflowTextAnimated widget, which is responsible for displaying the animated text.
5. The OverflowTextAnimated widget takes a long text string, a TextStyle for customization, a duration for the animation, and a repeat flag to control whether the animation should loop.
6. As the app runs, the text will scroll across the screen, providing a dynamic and engaging user experience.
