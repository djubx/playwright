In summary, the `mime_type_extension` package is a useful tool for determining the MIME type of a file based on its extension. This example demonstrates how to use the package to get the MIME type of a file and display it in the UI. The application flow is straightforward, with the user clicking a button to get the MIME type, and the UI updating to display the result.
