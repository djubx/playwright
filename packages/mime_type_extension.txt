# Overview of the `mime_type_extension` Flutter Package

The `mime_type_extension` package is a simple yet powerful utility for Flutter developers that allows you to easily map MIME types to file extensions and vice versa. This package is particularly useful when dealing with file uploads, downloads, or any scenario where you need to determine the file type based on its content or extension.

## When to Use This Package
- **File Uploads**: When you need to validate or process files based on their MIME types.
- **File Downloads**: To determine the appropriate file extension for downloaded files.
- **Content-Type Handling**: When working with APIs that return files, you can use this package to handle content types effectively.

## Key Features
- **MIME Type to Extension Mapping**: Convert a MIME type to its corresponding file extension.
- **Extension to MIME Type Mapping**: Get the MIME type based on a file extension.
- **Comprehensive Database**: Supports a wide range of MIME types and file extensions.

This package simplifies the process of handling file types in your Flutter applications, making it an essential tool for developers working with file management.

# Setting Up and Using the `mime_type_extension` Package

## Installation
To add the `mime_type_extension` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  mime_type_extension: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Details
The `mime_type_extension` package is designed to work seamlessly across both Android and iOS platforms. There are no additional configurations required for either platform, making it easy to integrate into your Flutter application.

## Basic Usage
Hereâ€™s how to use the package in your Flutter application:

1. **Import the Package**:
   ```dart
   import 'package:mime_type_extension/mime_type_extension.dart';
   ```

2. **Convert MIME Type to Extension**:
   ```dart
   String mimeType = 'image/jpeg';
   String? extension = mimeTypeToExtension(mimeType);
   print(extension); // Output: .jpg
   ```

3. **Convert Extension to MIME Type**:
   ```dart
   String fileExtension = '.jpg';
   String? mimeTypeFromExtension = extensionToMimeType(fileExtension);
   print(mimeTypeFromExtension); // Output: image/jpeg
   ```

With these simple steps, you can easily handle MIME types and file extensions in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Using `mime_type_extension`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mime_type_extension/mime_type_extension.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'MIME Type Extension Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('MIME Type Extension Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: MimeTypeExample(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MimeTypeExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Example MIME type
    String mimeType = 'image/png';
    // Convert MIME type to file extension
    String? extension = mimeTypeToExtension(mimeType);
    
    // Example file extension
    String fileExtension = '.png';
    // Convert file extension to MIME type
    String? mimeTypeFromExtension = extensionToMimeType(fileExtension);

    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Text('MIME Type: $mimeType'),
        Text('File Extension: $extension'),
        SizedBox(height: 20),
        Text('File Extension: $fileExtension'),
        Text('MIME Type: $mimeTypeFromExtension'),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold containing an AppBar and a centered body.
// 3. The MimeTypeExample widget is created, which performs the following:
//    - Defines a MIME type ('image/png') and converts it to its corresponding file extension using mimeTypeToExtension().
//    - Defines a file extension ('.png') and converts it back to its MIME type using extensionToMimeType().
// 4. The results are displayed in a Column widget, showing both the MIME type and the file extension conversions.
