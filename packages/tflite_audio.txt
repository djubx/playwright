# Overview of the tflite_audio Flutter Package

The `tflite_audio` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to integrate audio processing capabilities into their applications. This package leverages TensorFlow Lite to perform various audio-related tasks, such as audio classification, feature extraction, and more. It is particularly useful for applications that require real-time audio analysis, such as voice recognition, music classification, and sound event detection.

## When to Use `tflite_audio`

You should consider using the `tflite_audio` package in scenarios such as:

- **Voice Command Applications**: If you're building an app that responds to voice commands, this package can help you classify audio inputs effectively.
- **Music Classification**: For apps that categorize music genres or styles based on audio features.
- **Sound Event Detection**: Useful in smart home applications where you need to detect specific sounds (like glass breaking or a baby crying).

## Features

- **Real-time Audio Processing**: Process audio streams in real-time for immediate feedback.
- **TensorFlow Lite Integration**: Utilize pre-trained models for efficient audio classification.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Custom Model Support**: Allows developers to use their own TensorFlow Lite models for specific audio tasks.

With these features, `tflite_audio` provides a robust framework for audio processing in Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using tflite_audio

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `tflite_audio` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `tflite_audio` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  tflite_audio: ^0.1.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open `AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions to allow audio recording:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open `Info.plist` and add the following keys to request microphone access:

   ```xml
   <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
   <string>This app requires access to the microphone for audio processing.</string>
   ```

2. **Podfile**: Ensure your `platform` is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement audio classification using the `tflite_audio` package.

# Complete Example: RealFlutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tflite_audio/tflite_audio.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _result = "Press the button to start listening"; // Variable to hold the classification result

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _loadModel(); // Load the TensorFlow Lite model on initialization
  }

  // Function to load the TensorFlow Lite model
  Future<void> _loadModel() async {
    await TfliteAudio.loadModel(
      model: "assets/audio_model.tflite", // Path to your model file
      labels: "assets/labels.txt", // Path to your labels file
    );
  }

  // Function to start audio recording and classification
  Future<void> _startListening() async {
    await TfliteAudio.startAudioRecognition(); // Start audio recognition
    TfliteAudio.onRecognized.listen((result) {
      setState(() {
        _result = result; // Update the result with the recognized audio
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text("RealFlutter Audio Classifier")),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              Text(_result), // Display the classification result
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _startListening, // Start listening on button press
                child: Text("Start Listening"),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    TfliteAudio.stopAudioRecognition(); // Stop audio recognition when disposing
    super.dispose();
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget, we initialize the state and load the TensorFlow Lite model.
// 3. When the user presses the "Start Listening" button, the app begins audio recognition.
// 4. The recognized audio is processed, and the result is displayed on the screen.
// 5. The app listens for audio input and updates the result in real-time.
// 6. When the widget is disposed, audio recognition is stopped to free resources.
