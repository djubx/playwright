# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Animated Splash Screen Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `animated_splash_screen` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  animated_splash_screen: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Configure for Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file is set up correctly. You may want to set the theme for your splash screen. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following inside the `<application>` tag:

```xml
<activity
    android:name=".MainActivity"
    android:theme="@style/LaunchTheme"
    android:configChanges="orientation|keyboardHidden|keyboard|screenSize|smallestScreenSize|locale|layoutDirection|fontScale|screenLayout|direction|uiMode"
    android:launchMode="singleTop"
    android:hardwareAccelerated="true"
    android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize">
    <meta-data
        android:name="flutterEmbedding"
        android:value="2" />
</activity>
```

You may also want to define a custom theme in `android/app/src/main/res/values/styles.xml`:

```xml
<resources>
    <style name="LaunchTheme" parent="Theme.AppCompat.NoActionBar">
        <item name="android:windowBackground">@drawable/launch_background</item>
    </style>
</resources>
```

## Step 3: Configure for iOS

For iOS, you need to set the launch screen in `ios/Runner/Info.plist`. Add the following key-value pair:

```xml
<key>UILaunchStoryboardName</key>
<string>LaunchScreen</string>
```

You can customize the `LaunchScreen.storyboard` file located in `ios/Runner` to design your splash screen.

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s how to implement it in your `main.dart` file.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_splash_screen/animated_splash_screen.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animated Splash Screen Demo',
      home: AnimatedSplashScreen(
        // The splash screen will display this widget
        splash: Icons.home, // You can use an image or any widget here
        nextScreen: HomeScreen(), // The next screen after the splash
        splashTransition: SplashTransition.scaleTransition, // Animation type
        duration: 3000, // Duration of the splash screen in milliseconds
        backgroundColor: Colors.blue, // Background color of the splash screen
      ),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Welcome to the Home Screen!',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and an AnimatedSplashScreen as the home.
// 3. The AnimatedSplashScreen displays an icon (or any widget) for 3 seconds (3000 milliseconds).
// 4. After the duration, it transitions to the HomeScreen using a scale transition.
// 5. The HomeScreen displays a simple message welcoming the user.
```
