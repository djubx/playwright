# Tutorial: Setting Up gma_mediation_applovin

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `gma_mediation_applovin` package and explain how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `gma_mediation_applovin` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  gma_mediation_applovin: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Add the necessary permissions and metadata in your `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<manifest>
    <application>
        <!-- Add this inside the <application> tag -->
        <meta-data
            android:name="applovin.sdk.key"
            android:value="YOUR_APPLOVIN_SDK_KEY"/>
    </application>
</manifest>
```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure your `android/build.gradle` file includes the required repositories:

```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url 'https://artifactory.applovin.com/android' }
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Add the necessary keys in your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
<key>AppLovinSdkKey</key>
<string>YOUR_APPLOVIN_SDK_KEY</string>
```

2. **CocoaPods**: Ensure you have the necessary pods installed. Run the following command in your `ios` directory:

```bash
pod install
```

## Step 3: Initialize the SDK

In your main Dart file, initialize the AppLovin SDK before using any ad features:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gma_mediation_applovin/gma_mediation_applovin.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  RealFlutter.initialize(); // Initialize the SDK
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the package to load and display ads. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to load a banner ad:

```dart
RealFlutter.loadBannerAd();
```

This will load a banner ad that you can display in your app.

# Complete Example of gma_mediation_applovin

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gma_mediation_applovin/gma_mediation_applovin.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  RealFlutter.initialize(); // Initialize the AppLovin SDK
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'AppLovin Mediation Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  // Variable to hold the banner ad
  late RealFlutter bannerAd;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Load the banner ad when the screen initializes
    bannerAd = RealFlutter.loadBannerAd();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('AppLovin Mediation Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Welcome to AppLovin Mediation!'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Display the banner ad
            Container(
              height: 50,
              child: bannerAd, // Display the loaded banner ad
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Load and show an interstitial ad
                RealFlutter.loadInterstitialAd();
              },
              child: Text('Show Interstitial Ad'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts by initializing the AppLovin SDK in the main function.
// 2. The MyApp widget is created, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is displayed as the home screen of the app.
// 4. In the HomeScreen's initState, a banner ad is loaded.
// 5. The banner ad is displayed in a container within the Scaffold.
// 6. A button is provided to load and show an interstitial ad when pressed.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we have created a simple Flutter application that initializes the AppLovin SDK, loads a banner ad, and provides a button to show an interstitial ad. The comments within the code explain the flow of the application step-by-step, making it easy to understand how to implement the `gma_mediation_applovin` package in your own projects. 

### Final Summary

The application flow begins with the initialization of the AppLovin SDK, followed by the loading of a banner ad in the `HomeScreen` widget. The banner ad is displayed at the center of the screen, and a button allows users to load and show an interstitial ad. This structure provides a clear and functional example of how to utilize the `gma_mediation_applovin` package effectively in a Flutter application.
