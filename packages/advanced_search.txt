# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Advanced Search Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **advanced_search** package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **advanced_search** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  advanced_search: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration
For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if your search functionality requires access to the internet or other device features:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now, let's implement the **advanced_search** functionality in our Flutter app. Below is a simple example of how to set up the search feature.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:advanced_search/advanced_search.dart'; // Import the advanced_search package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Advanced Search Example',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: SearchPage(), // Set the home page to SearchPage
    );
  }
}

class SearchPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SearchPageState createState() => _SearchPageState();
}

class _SearchPageState extends State<SearchPage> {
  List<String> items = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry', 'Date', 'Fig', 'Grape']; // Sample data
  List<String> filteredItems = []; // List to hold filtered results

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    filteredItems = items; // Initialize filteredItems with all items
  }

  // Function to filter items based on the search query
  void _filterItems(String query) {
    if (query.isEmpty) {
      setState(() {
        filteredItems = items; // Show all items if query is empty
      });
    } else {
      setState(() {
        filteredItems = items
            .where((item) => item.toLowerCase().contains(query.toLowerCase())) // Filter items
            .toList();
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Advanced Search Example')), // AppBar with title
      body: Column(
        children: [
          Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
            child: TextField(
              onChanged: _filterItems, // Call _filterItems on text change
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Search',
                border: OutlineInputBorder(),
              ),
            ),
          ),
          Expanded(
            child: ListView.builder(
              itemCount: filteredItems.length, // Count of filtered items
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text(filteredItems[index]), // Display filtered item
                );
              },
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme, and the home page is set to SearchPage.
// 3. In SearchPage, we initialize a list of items and a filtered list to hold search results.
// 4. The _filterItems function filters the items based on the user's input in the TextField.
// 5. The TextField calls _filterItems whenever the text changes, updating the filtered list.
// 6. The ListView.builder displays the filtered items dynamically as the user types in the search box.
```
