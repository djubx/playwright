# Setting Up Fluwx in Your Flutter Project

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the Fluwx package and demonstrate how to use its features effectively.

## Step 1: Add Fluwx to Your Project

To get started, add the Fluwx package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  fluwx: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Configure for Android

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions and metadata:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>

<application>
    ...
    <meta-data
        android:name="com.tencent.mm.sdk.api.WXAppId"
        android:value="YOUR_WECHAT_APP_ID"/>
    <meta-data
        android:name="com.tencent.mm.sdk.api.WXAppSecret"
        android:value="YOUR_WECHAT_APP_SECRET"/>
</application>
```

Replace `YOUR_WECHAT_APP_ID` and `YOUR_WECHAT_APP_SECRET` with your actual WeChat app credentials.

2. **Enable WeChat SDK**: Ensure that you have the WeChat SDK integrated into your project. You can follow the official WeChat documentation for detailed steps.

## Step 3: Configure for iOS

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following entries:

```xml
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
    <dict>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
        <array>
            <string>YOUR_WECHAT_APP_ID</string>
        </array>
    </dict>
</array>
```

Replace `YOUR_WECHAT_APP_ID` with your actual WeChat app ID.

2. **Enable Background Modes**: In Xcode, go to your project settings, select the "Capabilities" tab, and enable "Background Modes". Check "Background fetch" and "Remote notifications".

## Step 4: Initialize Fluwx

In your main Dart file, initialize Fluwx in the `main()` function:

```dart
import 'package:fluwx/fluwx.dart' as fluwx;

void main() {
  fluwx.registerWxApi(appId: "YOUR_WECHAT_APP_ID", universalLink: "YOUR_UNIVERSAL_LINK");
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

Replace `YOUR_UNIVERSAL_LINK` with your actual universal link.

## Step 5: Using Fluwx

You can now use Fluwx to share content, make payments, or authenticate users. Hereâ€™s a simple example of sharing text:

```dart
fluwx.shareToWeChat(fluwx.WeChatShareTextModel(
  text: "Hello from Fluwx!",
  scene: fluwx.WeChatScene.SESSION,
));
```

This code snippet shares a text message to a WeChat session.

With these steps, you have successfully set up Fluwx in your Flutter project and are ready to implement its features.

# Complete Example of Fluwx in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fluwx/fluwx.dart' as fluwx;

void main() {
  // Register the WeChat API with your app ID and universal link
  fluwx.registerWxApi(appId: "YOUR_WECHAT_APP_ID", universalLink: "YOUR_UNIVERSAL_LINK");
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Fluwx Example',
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Fluwx Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Share a text message to WeChat
            fluwx.shareToWeChat(fluwx.WeChatShareTextModel(
              text: "Hello from Fluwx!",
              scene: fluwx.WeChatScene.SESSION,
            ));
          },
          child: Text('Share to WeChat'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Fluwx package by registering the WeChat API with the app ID and universal link.
// 2. The MyApp class builds the main MaterialApp widget, setting the title and home page.
// 3. The HomePage widget contains a button that, when pressed, triggers the sharing functionality.
// 4. The shareToWeChat method is called with a WeChatShareTextModel, which contains the text to be shared and the target scene (in this case, the WeChat session).
// 5. When the button is pressed, the text "Hello from Fluwx!" is shared to the user's WeChat session.
```
