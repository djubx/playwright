# Tutorial: Setting Up Kochava Tracker in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the Kochava Tracker Flutter package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `kochava_tracker` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  kochava_tracker: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions and metadata:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.yourapp">

    <application>
        ...
        <meta-data
            android:name="kochavaAppId"
            android:value="YOUR_KOCHAVA_APP_ID" />
    </application>
</manifest>
```

Replace `YOUR_KOCHAVA_APP_ID` with your actual Kochava App ID.

2. **Enable ProGuard**: If you are using ProGuard, ensure that you add the necessary rules to keep Kochava classes. This can be done in `android/app/proguard-rules.pro`:

```pro
-keep class com.kochava.** { *; }
```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following entries:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
<key>kochavaAppId</key>
<string>YOUR_KOCHAVA_APP_ID</string>
```

Replace `YOUR_KOCHAVA_APP_ID` with your actual Kochava App ID.

2. **CocoaPods**: Ensure you have the latest version of CocoaPods installed. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pod install
```

## Step 3: Initialize Kochava Tracker

In your main Dart file, initialize the Kochava Tracker in the `main()` function:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:kochava_tracker/kochava_tracker.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the Kochava Tracker
  KochavaTracker.init("YOUR_KOCHAVA_APP_ID");
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 4: Tracking Events

You can now track events in your app. For example, to track a button click:

```dart
KochavaTracker.trackEvent("button_click", {
  "button_name": "Start",
});
```

This will log the event to Kochava, allowing you to analyze user interactions.

# Complete Example: Kochava Tracker in Action

Here’s a complete example of a Flutter application that demonstrates the key features of the Kochava Tracker package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:kochava_tracker/kochava_tracker.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the Kochava Tracker with your App ID
  KochavaTracker.init("YOUR_KOCHAVA_APP_ID");
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Kochava Tracker Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Kochava Tracker Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Track button click event
            KochavaTracker.trackEvent("button_click", {
              "button_name": "Start",
            });
            // Navigate to the next screen
            Navigator.push(
              context,
              MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => SecondScreen()),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Start Tracking'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SecondScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Second Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Track another event
            KochavaTracker.trackEvent("second_screen_visit", {
              "screen_name": "Second Screen",
            });
            // Go back to the previous screen
            Navigator.pop(context);
          },
          child: Text('Go Back'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts by initializing the Kochava Tracker with the provided App ID.
// 2. The main screen displays a button labeled "Start Tracking".
// 3. When the button is pressed, an event "button_click" is tracked with the button name as a parameter.
// 4. The app navigates to the Second Screen.
// 5. On the Second Screen, there is another button to go back.
// 6. Pressing the "Go Back" button tracks a "second_screen_visit" event before navigating back to the main screen.
```
