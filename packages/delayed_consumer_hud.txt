# Delayed Consumer HUD: A Flutter Package for Smooth Loading Indicators

The `delayed_consumer_hud` package is a Flutter library designed to provide a smooth and customizable loading indicator for your applications. It is particularly useful when you want to show a loading state while waiting for data to be fetched or processed, without overwhelming the user with abrupt transitions. This package allows developers to create a user-friendly experience by delaying the display of loading indicators until necessary.

## When to Use This Package
- **Data Fetching**: When your app fetches data from an API and you want to show a loading indicator only if the operation takes longer than expected.
- **Heavy Computation**: If your app performs heavy computations that may take time, you can use this package to inform users that the app is still working.
- **User Experience**: To enhance user experience by avoiding flickering loading indicators that can occur with rapid state changes.

## Key Features
- **Customizable Delay**: Set a delay before the loading indicator appears, allowing for quick operations to complete without showing a loading state.
- **Flexible UI**: Customize the appearance of the loading indicator to match your app's design.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that integrates seamlessly with existing Flutter applications.

Overall, `delayed_consumer_hud` is an excellent choice for developers looking to improve the loading experience in their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Delayed Consumer HUD

## Installation
To use the `delayed_consumer_hud` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  delayed_consumer_hud: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/delayed_consumer_hud).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package
To use the `delayed_consumer_hud`, you can wrap your widget with `DelayedConsumerHud`. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:delayed_consumer_hud/delayed_consumer_hud.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Delayed Consumer HUD Example')),
        body: DelayedConsumerHud(
          delay: Duration(seconds: 1), // Delay before showing the HUD
          builder: (context, showLoading) {
            return Center(
              child: ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () async {
                  showLoading(); // Show loading indicator
                  await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3)); // Simulate a network call
                  // Hide loading indicator automatically after the delay
                },
                child: Text('Fetch Data'),
              ),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, the loading indicator will appear after a 1-second delay if the operation takes longer than that.

This setup allows you to provide a smooth user experience while waiting for data to load.

# Complete Example of Delayed Consumer HUD

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:delayed_consumer_hud/delayed_consumer_hud.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Delayed Consumer HUD Example')),
        body: DelayedConsumerHud(
          delay: Duration(seconds: 1), // Set a delay of 1 second
          builder: (context, showLoading) {
            return Center(
              child: ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () async {
                  showLoading(); // Show loading indicator when button is pressed
                  await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3)); // Simulate a network call
                  // After 3 seconds, the loading indicator will automatically hide
                },
                child: Text('Fetch Data'),
              ),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a body.
// 3. Inside the body, the DelayedConsumerHud widget is used, which takes a delay parameter.
// 4. The builder function provides a context and a showLoading function.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the showLoading function is called, displaying the loading indicator after the specified delay.
// 6. A simulated network call is made using Future.delayed, which lasts for 3 seconds.
// 7. After the delay, the loading indicator automatically hides, providing a smooth user experience.
