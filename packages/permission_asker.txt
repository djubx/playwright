# Overview of the `permission_asker` Flutter Package

The `permission_asker` package is a powerful tool for managing permissions in Flutter applications. It simplifies the process of requesting and checking permissions across both Android and iOS platforms, making it easier for developers to ensure that their apps have the necessary permissions to function correctly.

## When to Use `permission_asker`

You should consider using `permission_asker` when your Flutter application requires access to sensitive user data or device features, such as:

- Camera access for taking photos or videos
- Location services for GPS functionality
- Microphone access for voice recording
- Storage access for reading/writing files

## Key Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Simple API**: Easy-to-use methods for requesting and checking permissions.
- **Permission Status Handling**: Provides straightforward ways to handle different permission statuses (granted, denied, permanently denied).
- **Customizable Messages**: Allows developers to customize the permission request messages for a better user experience.

With these features, `permission_asker` helps streamline the permission management process, ensuring that your app remains user-friendly and compliant with platform guidelines.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `permission_asker`

## Installation

To add the `permission_asker` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  permission_asker: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/permission_asker).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the necessary permissions you want to request. For example, to request camera and location permissions, include:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
```

### iOS

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the required permission descriptions. For example:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to take photos.</string>
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your location for better service.</string>
```

## Using the Package

To use the `permission_asker` package, follow these steps:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:permission_asker/permission_asker.dart';
```

2. Create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class and use the provided methods to request permissions.

```dart
class RealFlutter {
  // Method to request camera permission
  Future<void> requestCameraPermission() async {
    final status = await PermissionAsker.requestPermission(Permission.camera);
    if (status.isGranted) {
      // Permission granted, proceed with camera functionality
    } else {
      // Handle permission denied
    }
  }
}
```

With this setup, you can easily manage permissions in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using `permission_asker`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:permission_asker/permission_asker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Permission Asker Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _permissionStatus = "Unknown";

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Request camera permission when the app starts
    requestCameraPermission();
  }

  Future<void> requestCameraPermission() async {
    // Requesting camera permission
    final status = await PermissionAsker.requestPermission(Permission.camera);
    setState(() {
      // Update the permission status based on the result
      _permissionStatus = status.isGranted ? "Camera Permission Granted" : "Camera Permission Denied";
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Permission Asker Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          _permissionStatus, // Display the current permission status
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and the `MyApp` widget is built.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` widget is created, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 3. In the `initState` method, the `requestCameraPermission` method is called to request camera access.
// 4. The `requestCameraPermission` method uses the `PermissionAsker` to request the camera permission.
// 5. Based on the user's response, the permission status is updated and displayed on the screen.
// 6. The UI reflects whether the camera permission was granted or denied.
