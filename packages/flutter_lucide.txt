# flutter_lucide Setup and Usage Tutorial

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_lucide` package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_lucide` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_lucide: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Import the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the icons, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_lucide/flutter_lucide.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using Icons

You can now use the icons in your Flutter widgets. Here’s a simple example of how to use an icon:

```dart
Icon(Lucide.home, size: 24.0, color: Colors.blue);
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

#### iOS

For iOS, make sure to enable the necessary permissions in your `Info.plist` if your app requires any specific capabilities. However, for using icons, no additional configurations are typically required.

## Step 4: Customizing Icons

You can customize the icons by changing their size and color. Here’s an example:

```dart
Icon(
  Lucide.settings,
  size: 30.0, // Custom size
  color: Colors.red, // Custom color
);
```

This customization allows you to match the icons with your app's theme and design.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate and use the `flutter_lucide` package in your Flutter application effectively.

# Complete Example of flutter_lucide in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_lucide/flutter_lucide.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Lucide Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Lucide Icons'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Displaying a home icon
            Icon(
              Lucide.home,
              size: 50.0, // Setting the size of the icon
              color: Colors.blue, // Setting the color of the icon
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
            // Displaying a settings icon
            Icon(
              Lucide.settings,
              size: 50.0, // Setting the size of the icon
              color: Colors.red, // Setting the color of the icon
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
            // Displaying a user icon
            Icon(
              Lucide.user,
              size: 50.0, // Setting the size of the icon
              color: Colors.green, // Setting the color of the icon
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of the MaterialApp is set to HomeScreen, which is the main screen of the app.
// 4. The HomeScreen widget builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the icons vertically.
// 6. Each Icon widget uses the Lucide icons, with specified sizes and colors.
// 7. The SizedBox widget is used to add spacing between the icons for better visual separation.
```
