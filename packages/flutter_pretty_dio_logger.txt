# flutter_pretty_dio_logger: A Comprehensive Overview

The `flutter_pretty_dio_logger` package is a powerful logging tool for the Dio HTTP client in Flutter applications. It enhances the debugging experience by providing a clean and formatted output of HTTP requests and responses, making it easier for developers to track and analyze network interactions.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using `flutter_pretty_dio_logger` in scenarios such as:
- **Debugging API Calls**: When developing applications that rely heavily on API interactions, this package helps visualize the requests and responses.
- **Monitoring Network Performance**: It can be used to log the time taken for requests, which is crucial for performance tuning.
- **Error Tracking**: The package can help identify issues in API calls by logging error responses in a structured format.

## Features

- **Formatted Output**: Provides a clean and readable format for logging HTTP requests and responses.
- **Customizable**: Allows customization of log levels and formats to suit your needs.
- **Integration with Dio**: Seamlessly integrates with the Dio HTTP client, which is widely used in Flutter applications for making network requests.

By using `flutter_pretty_dio_logger`, developers can significantly improve their debugging process and gain better insights into their application's network behavior.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_pretty_dio_logger

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_pretty_dio_logger` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_pretty_dio_logger` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dio: ^5.0.0 # Ensure you have Dio installed
  flutter_pretty_dio_logger: ^1.0.0 # Add the logger package
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the new dependencies.

## Step 2: Basic Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to access the internet. Add the following line inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you typically do not need to add any specific permissions for network access, but ensure that your `Info.plist` allows arbitrary loads if you are testing with HTTP:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now, let’s set up the logger in your Flutter application. Below is an example of how to integrate `flutter_pretty_dio_logger` with the Dio client.

```dart
import 'package:dio/dio.dart';
import 'package:flutter_pretty_dio_logger/flutter_pretty_dio_logger.dart';

class RealFlutter {
  final Dio dio;

  RealFlutter() : dio = Dio() {
    // Initialize the logger
    dio.interceptors.add(PrettyDioLogger(
      requestHeader: true, // Log request headers
      request: true, // Log request body
      responseHeader: true, // Log response headers
      response: true, // Log response body
      error: true, // Log errors
      compact: false, // Set to true for compact logs
      maxWidth: 90, // Set max width for log output
    ));
  }

  // Method to make a sample GET request
  Future<void> fetchData() async {
    try {
      final response = await dio.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
      print(response.data); // Print the response data
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error: $e'); // Print any errors
    }
  }
}
```

In this setup:
- We create an instance of `Dio` and add the `PrettyDioLogger` interceptor to it.
- The logger is configured to log various aspects of the HTTP requests and responses.
- A sample method `fetchData` is provided to demonstrate making a GET request.

# Complete Example: A Functional Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dio/dio.dart';
import 'package:flutter_pretty_dio_logger/flutter_pretty_dio_logger.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Pretty Dio Logger Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  final RealFlutter realFlutter = RealFlutter(); // Create an instance of RealFlutter

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    realFlutter.fetchData(); // Fetch data when the screen initializes
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Dio Logger Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Check console for logs'), // Inform user to check console
      ),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter {
  final Dio dio;

  RealFlutter() : dio = Dio() {
    // Initialize the logger
    dio.interceptors.add(PrettyDioLogger(
      requestHeader: true, // Log request headers
      request: true, // Log request body
      responseHeader: true, // Log response headers
      response: true, // Log response body
      error: true, // Log errors
      compact: false, // Set to true for compact logs
      maxWidth: 90, // Set max width for log output
    ));
  }

  // Method to make a sample GET request
  Future<void> fetchData() async {
    try {
      final response = await dio.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
      print(response.data); // Print the response data
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error: $e'); // Print any errors
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a HomeScreen as its home widget.
// 3. In the HomeScreen's initState, we create an instance of RealFlutter and call fetchData.
// 4. The fetchData method makes a GET request to a sample API and logs the request and response details.
// 5. The user is informed to check the console for logs, where they can see the formatted output of the HTTP interactions.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this complete example, we have created a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the `flutter_pretty_dio_logger` package. The application fetches data from a sample API and logs the details of the request and response in a structured format. 

### Summary of Application Flow
- The application initializes and displays a simple UI.
- Upon loading, it makes an API call to fetch data.
- The logger captures and displays all relevant HTTP request and response details in the console, aiding in debugging and monitoring.

This structured approach to using the `flutter_pretty_dio_logger` package will help developers effectively manage and debug their network requests in Flutter applications.
