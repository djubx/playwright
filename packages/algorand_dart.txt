# Overview of the algorand_dart Flutter Package

The `algorand_dart` package is a Dart library designed to facilitate interaction with the Algorand blockchain. It provides developers with the tools necessary to build decentralized applications (dApps) that can communicate with the Algorand network. This package is particularly useful for developers looking to integrate blockchain functionalities such as asset management, smart contracts, and transaction handling into their Flutter applications.

## When to Use This Package
- **Building dApps**: If you're developing a decentralized application that requires blockchain interactions, `algorand_dart` is an excellent choice.
- **Asset Management**: The package allows for easy management of Algorand assets, making it suitable for applications that involve token transactions.
- **Smart Contracts**: If your application needs to execute smart contracts on the Algorand blockchain, this package provides the necessary tools.

## Key Features
- **Transaction Handling**: Create, sign, and send transactions to the Algorand network.
- **Account Management**: Manage Algorand accounts, including creating new accounts and retrieving account information.
- **Asset Operations**: Support for creating, transferring, and managing Algorand Standard Assets (ASAs).
- **Smart Contract Interaction**: Execute and interact with Algorand smart contracts.

The `algorand_dart` package is a powerful tool for any Flutter developer looking to leverage the capabilities of the Algorand blockchain in their applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using algorand_dart

## Installation
To get started with the `algorand_dart` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  algorand_dart: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/algorand_dart).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21.
2. Add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
Once you have installed the package and configured your project, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to create an Algorand account and retrieve its balance.

```dart
import 'package:algorand_dart/algorand_dart.dart';

void main() async {
  // Create a new Algorand account
  final account = await Algorand.createAccount();
  
  // Print the account address
  print('Account Address: ${account.address}');
  
  // Retrieve the account balance
  final balance = await Algorand.getAccountBalance(account.address);
  
  // Print the account balance
  print('Account Balance: $balance');
}
```

This example demonstrates the basic functionality of creating an account and checking its balance. You can expand upon this by implementing more complex features such as sending transactions or managing assets.

# Complete Example of Using algorand_dart

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:algorand_dart/algorand_dart.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Algorand Dart Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Algorand Dart Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: FutureBuilder(
            future: _createAndFetchAccount(),
            builder: (context, snapshot) {
              if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                return CircularProgressIndicator(); // Show loading indicator while waiting
              } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
                return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}'); // Show error message if any
              } else {
                return Text('Account Balance: ${snapshot.data}'); // Display account balance
              }
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to create an account and fetch its balance
  Future<String> _createAndFetchAccount() async {
    // Create a new Algorand account
    final account = await Algorand.createAccount();
    
    // Print the account address for debugging
    print('Account Address: ${account.address}');
    
    // Retrieve the account balance
    final balance = await Algorand.getAccountBalance(account.address);
    
    // Print the account balance for debugging
    print('Account Balance: $balance');
    
    // Return the balance as a string to display in the UI
    return balance.toString();
  }
}
```

```dart
// The above code is a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the algorand_dart package.
// 
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, a FutureBuilder is used to handle asynchronous operations.
// 4. The _createAndFetchAccount function is called to create a new Algorand account and fetch its balance.
// 5. While waiting for the future to complete, a CircularProgressIndicator is displayed.
// 6. If an error occurs, it is displayed in the UI.
// 7. Once the account balance is retrieved, it is displayed in the center of the screen.
// 
// This example provides a basic understanding of how to interact with the Algorand blockchain using the algorand_dart package in a Flutter application.
