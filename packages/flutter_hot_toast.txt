# Setting Up and Using flutter_hot_toast

## Installation
To add `flutter_hot_toast` to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_hot_toast: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, no additional configuration is typically required. Just ensure that your project is set up to support iOS development.

## Basic Usage
To use `flutter_hot_toast`, you need to import the package and call the toast methods in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_hot_toast/flutter_hot_toast.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Hot Toast Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Show a success toast
            showToast("Data saved successfully!", context: context);
          },
          child: Text('Show Toast'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, a toast notification will appear at the bottom of the screen.

# Complete Example of flutter_hot_toast

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_hot_toast/flutter_hot_toast.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Initialize the toast package
    return MaterialApp(
      builder: (context, child) {
        // Wrap the app with HotToast to enable toast notifications
        return HotToast(child: child);
      },
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Hot Toast Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Show a success toast
                showToast("Data saved successfully!", context: context);
              },
              child: Text('Show Success Toast'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Show an error toast
                showToast("Error saving data!", context: context, backgroundColor: Colors.red);
              },
              child: Text('Show Error Toast'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Show an info toast
                showToast("This is an info message.", context: context, backgroundColor: Colors.blue);
              },
              child: Text('Show Info Toast'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget sets up the MaterialApp and wraps it with HotToast to enable toast notifications.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is displayed, containing three buttons for showing different types of toasts.
// 4. When the "Show Success Toast" button is pressed, a success message appears at the bottom of the screen.
// 5. Similarly, pressing the "Show Error Toast" button displays an error message with a red background.
// 6. The "Show Info Toast" button shows an informational message with a blue background.
// 7. Each toast message is displayed briefly and does not require user interaction, enhancing the user experience.
