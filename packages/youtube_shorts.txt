# Tutorial: Setting Up the YouTube Shorts Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `youtube_shorts` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `youtube_shorts` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  youtube_shorts: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

## Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:youtube_shorts/youtube_shorts.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the `youtube_shorts` package to display YouTube Shorts in your application. Here’s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
// Inside your widget build method
YoutubeShorts(
  videoId: 'your_video_id', // Replace with your YouTube Shorts video ID
  autoPlay: true, // Set to true to autoplay the video
  loop: true, // Set to true to loop the video
),
```

This will create a YouTube Shorts player that automatically plays the specified video.

# Complete Example of Using the YouTube Shorts Package

Here’s a complete example of a Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the `youtube_shorts` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:youtube_shorts/youtube_shorts.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'YouTube Shorts Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: ShortsScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ShortsScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('YouTube Shorts'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: YoutubeShorts(
          videoId: 'your_video_id', // Replace with your YouTube Shorts video ID
          autoPlay: true, // Automatically play the video
          loop: true, // Loop the video
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to ShortsScreen, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 4. ShortsScreen builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, the YoutubeShorts widget is used to display a specific YouTube Shorts video.
