# YAML Edit Flutter Package

The `yaml_edit` package is a powerful tool for manipulating YAML files in Flutter applications. It provides a simple and efficient way to read, modify, and write YAML data, making it an essential package for developers who need to handle configuration files, settings, or any structured data in YAML format.

## When to Use `yaml_edit`

You might consider using the `yaml_edit` package in scenarios such as:
- **Configuration Management**: When your application requires dynamic configuration settings that can be modified at runtime.
- **Data Serialization**: If you need to serialize and deserialize complex data structures in YAML format.
- **File Manipulation**: When you need to read from or write to YAML files, such as saving user preferences or application settings.

## Features

- **Read and Write YAML**: Easily read from and write to YAML files.
- **Modify YAML Data**: Update existing YAML data without needing to rewrite the entire file.
- **Support for Nested Structures**: Handle complex nested YAML structures seamlessly.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in error handling for invalid YAML formats.

With these features, `yaml_edit` simplifies the process of working with YAML in Flutter applications, allowing developers to focus on building their apps rather than dealing with file formats.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `yaml_edit`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `yaml_edit` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  yaml_edit: ^1.0.0
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` to allow file access if you are reading or writing files in the app's document directory.

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the package as follows:

```dart
import 'package:yaml_edit/yaml_edit.dart';
```

## Step 4: Basic Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the `yaml_edit` package:

```dart
void main() {
  // Create a new YAML editor instance
  final editor = YamlEditor('''
  name: Flutter App
  description: A sample Flutter application
  ''');
  
  // Add a new key-value pair
  editor.update(['version'], '1.0.0');
  
  // Print the modified YAML
  print(editor.toString());
}
```

This code initializes a YAML editor with a basic YAML structure, updates the version, and prints the modified YAML.

# Complete Example of Using `yaml_edit`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:yaml_edit/yaml_edit.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'YAML Edit Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('YAML Edit Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Create a new YAML editor instance with initial YAML data
              final editor = YamlEditor('''
              name: Flutter App
              description: A sample Flutter application
              ''');
              
              // Update the version key in the YAML
              editor.update(['version'], '1.0.0');
              
              // Add a new key-value pair for author
              editor.update(['author'], 'John Doe');
              
              // Print the modified YAML to the console
              print(editor.toString());
            },
            child: Text('Edit YAML'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 4. When the button is pressed, a new YamlEditor instance is created with initial YAML data.
// 5. The version key is updated to '1.0.0'.
// 6. A new key 'author' is added with the value 'John Doe'.
// 7. The modified YAML is printed to the console, showing the updated structure.
