# Overview of the app_state_checker Flutter Package

The `app_state_checker` package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers to easily manage and monitor the state of their applications. It provides a simple way to check the app's state, such as whether it is in the foreground or background, and whether the device is connected to the internet. This package is particularly useful for applications that require real-time updates based on the app's lifecycle or network connectivity.

## When to Use This Package
- **Lifecycle Management**: If your app needs to perform specific actions when it enters the background or foreground.
- **Network Monitoring**: To check the internet connectivity status and respond accordingly.
- **State-Dependent UI**: For applications that need to change their UI based on the app's state or network status.

## Key Features
- **Lifecycle State Monitoring**: Detects when the app goes into the background or comes back to the foreground.
- **Network Connectivity Checks**: Monitors the device's internet connection status.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that can be easily integrated into any Flutter application.

Overall, `app_state_checker` is an essential package for developers looking to enhance their app's responsiveness to state changes and network conditions.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using app_state_checker

## Installation
To add the `app_state_checker` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  app_state_checker: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/app_state_checker).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to access the internet:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `Info.plist` to allow network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Using the Package
To use the `app_state_checker` package, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:
   ```dart
   import 'package:app_state_checker/app_state_checker.dart';
   ```

2. Create an instance of `AppStateChecker` and set up listeners for state changes:
   ```dart
   AppStateChecker appStateChecker = AppStateChecker();

   appStateChecker.addListener(() {
     // Handle app state changes here
   });
   ```

3. You can check the current state and connectivity status:
   ```dart
   bool isConnected = await appStateChecker.isConnected();
   AppLifecycleState currentState = appStateChecker.currentState;
   ```

By following these steps, you can effectively monitor your app's state and network connectivity using the `app_state_checker` package.

# Complete Example of Using app_state_checker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:app_state_checker/app_state_checker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Create an instance of AppStateChecker
  final AppStateChecker appStateChecker = AppStateChecker();
  String appStateMessage = "App is running";

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    
    // Add a listener to monitor app state changes
    appStateChecker.addListener(() {
      // Update the UI based on the app's lifecycle state
      setState(() {
        appStateMessage = appStateChecker.currentState == AppLifecycleState.resumed
            ? "App is in the foreground"
            : "App is in the background";
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Remove the listener when the widget is disposed
    appStateChecker.removeListener();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('App State Checker Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text(appStateMessage), // Display the current app state
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () async {
                  // Check network connectivity
                  bool isConnected = await appStateChecker.isConnected();
                  ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                    SnackBar(
                      content: Text(isConnected ? "Connected to the Internet" : "No Internet Connection"),
                    ),
                  );
                },
                child: Text('Check Internet Connection'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code demonstrates how to use the app_state_checker package in a Flutter application.
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatefulWidget that manages the app's state.
// 3. In the initState method, we create an instance of AppStateChecker and add a listener to monitor app state changes.
// 4. When the app state changes, we update the appStateMessage variable to reflect whether the app is in the foreground or background.
// 5. The build method constructs the UI, displaying the current app state and providing a button to check internet connectivity.
// 6. When the button is pressed, it checks the internet connection and shows a SnackBar with the result.
// 7. The dispose method removes the listener to prevent memory leaks when the widget is removed from the widget tree.
