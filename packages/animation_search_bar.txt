# Tutorial: Setting Up the Animation Search Bar

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `animation_search_bar` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, you need to add the `animation_search_bar` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  animation_search_bar: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install the Package
Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Import the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:animation_search_bar/animation_search_bar.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Animation Search Bar
You can now use the `AnimationSearchBar` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
AnimationSearchBar(
  onSearch: (value) {
    // Handle search action
    print("Searching for: $value");
  },
  hintText: "Search...",
  // Additional customization options
)
```

With these steps, you have successfully set up the `animation_search_bar` package in your Flutter application. You can now customize it further to fit your app's design and functionality.

# Complete Example of Animation Search Bar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animation_search_bar/animation_search_bar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animation Search Bar Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: SearchPage(),
    );
  }
}

class SearchPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SearchPageState createState() => _SearchPageState();
}

class _SearchPageState extends State<SearchPage> {
  // Variable to hold the search query
  String _searchQuery = '';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Search Example'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Animation Search Bar widget
          AnimationSearchBar(
            onSearch: (value) {
              // Update the search query when the user searches
              setState(() {
                _searchQuery = value;
              });
            },
            hintText: "Search...",
          ),
          // Displaying the search results
          Expanded(
            child: ListView.builder(
              itemCount: _searchResults().length,
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text(_searchResults()[index]),
                );
              },
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }

  // Method to simulate search results based on the query
  List<String> _searchResults() {
    // Sample data to search from
    List<String> data = [
      'Apple',
      'Banana',
      'Cherry',
      'Date',
      'Elderberry',
      'Fig',
      'Grape',
      'Honeydew',
    ];

    // Return filtered results based on the search query
    return data
        .where((item) => item.toLowerCase().contains(_searchQuery.toLowerCase()))
        .toList();
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home page is set to SearchPage, which is a stateful widget.
// 4. In SearchPage, we have an AnimationSearchBar that takes an onSearch callback.
// 5. When the user types in the search bar, the onSearch callback updates the _searchQuery state.
// 6. The ListView.builder displays the filtered search results based on the _searchQuery.
// 7. The _searchResults method filters the sample data based on the user's input and returns the matching items.
