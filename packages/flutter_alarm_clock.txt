# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Flutter Alarm Clock Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `flutter_alarm_clock` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_alarm_clock: ^0.0.5  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `AndroidManifest.xml` located in `android/app/src/main/`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SET_ALARM"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open `Info.plist` located in `ios/Runner/`.
2. Add the following key to request permission for notifications:

```xml
<key>NSLocalNotificationUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to set alarms.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to set an alarm.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_alarm_clock/flutter_alarm_clock.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Alarm Clock Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Set an alarm for 7:00 AM
              FlutterAlarmClock.createAlarm(7, 0);
            },
            child: Text('Set Alarm for 7:00 AM'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, an alarm is set for 7:00 AM. You can customize the time as needed.

# Complete Example of Using the Flutter Alarm Clock Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_alarm_clock/flutter_alarm_clock.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Alarm Clock Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Set an alarm for 7:00 AM
              FlutterAlarmClock.createAlarm(7, 0);
            },
            child: Text('Set Alarm for 7:00 AM'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Alarm Clock Example'.
// 4. In the body of the Scaffold, a Center widget is used to center the content.
// 5. An ElevatedButton is created, which, when pressed, triggers the onPressed callback.
// 6. Inside the onPressed callback, the FlutterAlarmClock.createAlarm method is called with parameters 7 and 0, setting an alarm for 7:00 AM.
// 7. The button displays the text 'Set Alarm for 7:00 AM', providing a clear action for the user.
