# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Responsive Notebook Background Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up and using the `responsive_notebook_background` package in a Flutter project. We will cover platform-specific configurations for both Android and iOS to ensure optimal performance.

## Setup Process

### Step 1: Add Dependency

First, add the `responsive_notebook_background` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  responsive_notebook_background: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:responsive_notebook_background/responsive_notebook_background.dart';
```

### Step 3: Platform-Specific Configurations

#### Android

Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

#### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least iOS 10.0. You can set this in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

### Step 4: Using the Package

To use the package, wrap your main widget with `ResponsiveNotebookBackground`:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ResponsiveNotebookBackground(
      child: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Responsive Background Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Hello, World!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:responsive_notebook_background/responsive_notebook_background.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // The main widget of the application
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Responsive Background Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: ResponsiveNotebookBackgroundExample(),
    );
  }
}

class ResponsiveNotebookBackgroundExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Wrapping the Scaffold with ResponsiveNotebookBackground
    return ResponsiveNotebookBackground(
      // The child widget that will have the responsive background
      child: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Responsive Background Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text(
                'This is a responsive background!',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Button to demonstrate interaction
                  ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                    SnackBar(content: Text('Button Pressed!')),
                  );
                },
                child: Text('Press Me'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow:
// 1. The application starts by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. The home of the MaterialApp is set to ResponsiveNotebookBackgroundExample.
// 4. ResponsiveNotebookBackgroundExample is a StatelessWidget that uses ResponsiveNotebookBackground.
// 5. ResponsiveNotebookBackground wraps a Scaffold, providing a responsive background.
// 6. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget with a Column.
// 7. The Column has a Text widget and an ElevatedButton.
// 8. Pressing the button shows a SnackBar, demonstrating interaction within the app.
