# Setting Up and Using the Flutter Sparkle Package

## Installation
To get started with `flutter_sparkle`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_sparkle: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_sparkle).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` if you plan to use any features that require them. However, for basic usage of `flutter_sparkle`, no additional configurations are typically required.

## Using the Package
Once you have installed the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the sparkling effect.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_sparkle/flutter_sparkle.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Sparkle Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Sparkle(
            child: ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action when button is pressed
              },
              child: Text('Sparkle Button'),
            ),
            sparkleColor: Colors.yellow,
            sparkleSize: 10.0,
            sparkleCount: 50,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we wrap an `ElevatedButton` with the `Sparkle` widget, which adds the sparkling effect to the button. You can customize the `sparkleColor`, `sparkleSize`, and `sparkleCount` to achieve the desired effect.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate `flutter_sparkle` into your Flutter application seamlessly.

# Complete Example of Flutter Sparkle

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_sparkle/flutter_sparkle.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Sparkle Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Wrapping the button with Sparkle widget to add sparkling effect
          child: Sparkle(
            child: ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action when button is pressed
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Button Pressed!')),
                );
              },
              child: Text('Sparkle Button'),
            ),
            sparkleColor: Colors.yellow, // Color of the sparkles
            sparkleSize: 10.0, // Size of each sparkle
            sparkleCount: 50, // Number of sparkles
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center, we have a Sparkle widget wrapping an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, a SnackBar appears at the bottom of the screen.
// 6. The Sparkle widget adds a sparkling effect around the button, enhancing its visual appeal.
