# Telnet Flutter Package: A Comprehensive Guide

## <-- START_DESCRIPTION -->

### Description

The **telnet** Flutter package is a powerful tool that allows developers to create applications capable of communicating with Telnet servers. Telnet is a network protocol used to provide a command-line interface for communication with a remote device or server. This package is particularly useful for applications that require remote management, monitoring, or control of devices over a network.

### When to Use

You might consider using the **telnet** package in scenarios such as:
- Building network management tools that require command-line access to devices.
- Creating educational applications that simulate Telnet sessions for learning purposes.
- Developing remote control applications for IoT devices that support Telnet.

### Features

- **Connection Management**: Easily connect and disconnect from Telnet servers.
- **Command Execution**: Send commands to the server and receive responses.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Non-blocking operations to keep the UI responsive.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in mechanisms to handle connection errors and timeouts.

### Tutorial

#### Installation

To use the **telnet** package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  telnet: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

#### Platform-Specific Details

- **Android**: Ensure that your AndroidManifest.xml file has the necessary permissions for internet access:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

- **iOS**: For iOS, you may need to configure App Transport Security settings in your Info.plist file to allow connections to non-secure servers:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

#### Basic Usage

To use the **telnet** package, you will typically follow these steps:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:
   ```dart
   import 'package:telnet/telnet.dart';
   ```

2. Create an instance of the Telnet class and connect to a server:
   ```dart
   final telnet = Telnet('your.telnet.server', 23);
   ```

3. Send commands and handle responses:
   ```dart
   telnet.write('your command');
   String response = await telnet.read();
   ```

4. Close the connection when done:
   ```dart
   telnet.close();
   ```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:telnet/telnet.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Create a Telnet instance
  late Telnet telnet;
  String response = '';
  final TextEditingController commandController = TextEditingController();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the Telnet connection
    telnet = Telnet('your.telnet.server', 23);
  }

  // Function to send command to the Telnet server
  void sendCommand() async {
    // Get the command from the text field
    String command = commandController.text;
    // Write the command to the Telnet server
    telnet.write(command);
    // Read the response from the server
    String serverResponse = await telnet.read();
    // Update the state with the response
    setState(() {
      response = serverResponse;
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Close the Telnet connection when the widget is disposed
    telnet.close();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Telnet Client'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Column(
            children: [
              // Text field for command input
              TextField(
                controller: commandController,
                decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter Command'),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 10),
              // Button to send command
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: sendCommand,
                child: Text('Send Command'),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Display the response from the server
              Text('Response: $response'),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation

// The application starts by running the `main` function, which initializes the `RealFlutter` widget.
// In the `initState` method, a Telnet connection is established to the specified server on port 23.
// The user can input a command in the text field and press the "Send Command" button.
// When the button is pressed, the `sendCommand` function is called.
// This function retrieves the command from the text field, sends it to the Telnet server, and waits for a response.
// Once the response is received, the state is updated to display the response on the screen.
// Finally, when the widget is disposed, the Telnet connection is closed to free up resources.
