In summary, the code flows as follows:

1. The user presses one of the buttons.
2. The corresponding haptic feedback is generated using the `MacosHapticFeedback` class.
3. The user feels the haptic feedback on their macOS device.
4. The application continues to run normally.

Note that the `MacosHapticFeedback` class only works on macOS devices. If you try to use it on other platforms, it will not work.
