## Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:macos_haptic_feedback/macos_haptic_feedback.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Haptic Feedback Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Haptic Feedback Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Trigger haptic feedback when the button is pressed
              MacosHapticFeedback.vibrate();
              // Show a snackbar to indicate the action
              ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                SnackBar(content: Text('Haptic Feedback Triggered!')),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Press Me'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Haptic Feedback Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold has a Center widget that centers its child.
// 5. An ElevatedButton is created, which triggers haptic feedback when pressed.
// 6. Upon pressing the button, MacosHapticFeedback.vibrate() is called to provide haptic feedback.
// 7. A Snackbar is displayed to inform the user that haptic feedback has been triggered.
