# Tutorial: Setting Up hcaptcha_widget

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `hcaptcha_widget` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the `hcaptcha_widget` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  hcaptcha_widget: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add internet permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the hcaptcha_widget

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is an example of how to implement the hCaptcha widget.

# Complete Example of hcaptcha_widget

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:hcaptcha_widget/hcaptcha_widget.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'hCaptcha Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('hCaptcha Integration'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: hCaptchaWidget(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // This method creates the hCaptcha widget
  Widget hCaptchaWidget() {
    return HCaptcha(
      siteKey: 'YOUR_HCAPTCHA_SITE_KEY', // Replace with your hCaptcha site key
      onSuccess: (String token) {
        // Handle successful verification
        print('hCaptcha Success: $token');
      },
      onError: (String error) {
        // Handle error
        print('hCaptcha Error: $error');
      },
      onExpired: () {
        // Handle token expiration
        print('hCaptcha Token Expired');
      },
    );
  }
}
```

```
// The main function initializes the Flutter app and runs the RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a simple Scaffold.
// Inside the Scaffold, we have an AppBar with the title 'hCaptcha Integration'.
// The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers the hCaptcha widget.
// The hCaptcha widget is created using the HCaptcha class, where we provide the site key.
// We also define three callbacks: onSuccess, onError, and onExpired.
// - onSuccess: This callback is triggered when the user successfully completes the hCaptcha challenge.
// - onError: This callback is triggered if there is an error during the hCaptcha process.
// - onExpired: This callback is triggered when the hCaptcha token expires, prompting the user to try again.
