# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Scroll Wheel Date Picker

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the `scroll_wheel_date_picker` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  scroll_wheel_date_picker: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable the use of Swift in your project. Open your `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode and ensure that the project settings are configured to support Swift.

## Step 4: Importing the Package
In your Dart file where you want to use the date picker, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:scroll_wheel_date_picker/scroll_wheel_date_picker.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Date Picker
You can now use the `ScrollWheelDatePicker` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
ScrollWheelDatePicker(
  initialDate: DateTime.now(),
  onDateChanged: (newDate) {
    // Handle the date change
    print("Selected date: $newDate");
  },
)
```

This widget will display a scrollable date picker that allows users to select a date. You can customize it further by adjusting its properties.

# Complete Example of Scroll Wheel Date Picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:scroll_wheel_date_picker/scroll_wheel_date_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Scroll Wheel Date Picker Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Scroll Wheel Date Picker'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: DatePickerWidget(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DatePickerWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DatePickerWidgetState createState() => _DatePickerWidgetState();
}

class _DatePickerWidgetState extends State<DatePickerWidget> {
  DateTime selectedDate = DateTime.now(); // Initialize with the current date

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        // Display the currently selected date
        Text(
          'Selected Date: ${selectedDate.toLocal()}'.split(' ')[0],
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20),
        // Scroll Wheel Date Picker
        ScrollWheelDatePicker(
          initialDate: selectedDate,
          onDateChanged: (newDate) {
            setState(() {
              selectedDate = newDate; // Update the selected date
            });
          },
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a centered body with the DatePickerWidget.
// 4. DatePickerWidget is a StatefulWidget that maintains the selected date state.
// 5. The build method displays the currently selected date and the ScrollWheelDatePicker.
// 6. When the user selects a new date, the onDateChanged callback updates the selected date state.
// 7. The UI is rebuilt to reflect the newly selected date.
