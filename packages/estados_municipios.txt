# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using estados_municipios

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `estados_municipios` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `estados_municipios` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  estados_municipios: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:estados_municipios/estados_municipios.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if your app requires location services. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to provide better services.</string>
```

## Step 4: Example Usage

You can now use the package to fetch states and municipalities. Here’s a simple example of how to implement a dropdown for selecting a state and its corresponding municipalities.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:estados_municipios/estados_municipios.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variables to hold selected state and municipality
  String? selectedState;
  String? selectedMunicipality;

  // List to hold states and municipalities
  List<String> states = [];
  List<String> municipalities = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Fetching the list of states from the package
    states = EstadosMunicipios.getEstados();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Estados e Municípios'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Column(
            children: [
              // Dropdown for selecting state
              DropdownButton<String>(
                hint: Text('Selecione um Estado'),
                value: selectedState,
                onChanged: (String? newValue) {
                  setState(() {
                    selectedState = newValue;
                    // Fetch municipalities based on selected state
                    municipalities = EstadosMunicipios.getMunicipios(selectedState!);
                    selectedMunicipality = null; // Reset municipality selection
                  });
                },
                items: states.map<DropdownMenuItem<String>>((String state) {
                  return DropdownMenuItem<String>(
                    value: state,
                    child: Text(state),
                  );
                }).toList(),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Dropdown for selecting municipality
              DropdownButton<String>(
                hint: Text('Selecione um Município'),
                value: selectedMunicipality,
                onChanged: (String? newValue) {
                  setState(() {
                    selectedMunicipality = newValue;
                  });
                },
                items: municipalities.map<DropdownMenuItem<String>>((String municipality) {
                  return DropdownMenuItem<String>(
                    value: municipality,
                    child: Text(municipality),
                  );
                }).toList(),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget, we maintain the state for selected state and municipality.
// 3. On initialization, we fetch the list of states using the package.
// 4. The UI consists of two dropdowns: one for states and one for municipalities.
// 5. When a state is selected, we fetch the corresponding municipalities and update the UI.
// 6. The user can then select a municipality from the second dropdown.
// 7. The app dynamically updates based on user selections, providing a seamless experience.
```
