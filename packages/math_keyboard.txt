# Tutorial: Setting Up the Math Keyboard Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **math_keyboard** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **math_keyboard** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  math_keyboard: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0' # Ensure this is set to at least 10.0
```

## Step 3: Using the Math Keyboard

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to integrate the math keyboard into your app.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:math_keyboard/math_keyboard.dart';
```

2. Create a text field that will use the math keyboard:

```dart
TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController();

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Math Keyboard Example')),
    body: Center(
      child: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: [
          TextField(
            controller: _controller,
            decoration: InputDecoration(
              labelText: 'Enter Math Expression',
            ),
            keyboardType: TextInputType.none, // Disable default keyboard
            onTap: () {
              // Show the math keyboard when the text field is tapped
              showMathKeyboard(context, _controller);
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

In this example, we disable the default keyboard and show the math keyboard when the user taps on the text field.

## Conclusion

You have now successfully set up the **math_keyboard** package in your Flutter application. You can customize the keyboard further based on your application's requirements.

# Complete Example of Math Keyboard in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:math_keyboard/math_keyboard.dart'; // Import the math keyboard package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the main application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Math Keyboard Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MathKeyboardHome(), // Set the home widget
    );
  }
}

class MathKeyboardHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MathKeyboardHomeState createState() => _MathKeyboardHomeState();
}

class _MathKeyboardHomeState extends State<MathKeyboardHome> {
  TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController(); // Controller for the text field

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Math Keyboard Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            TextField(
              controller: _controller, // Bind the controller to the text field
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Enter Math Expression',
              ),
              keyboardType: TextInputType.none, // Disable the default keyboard
              onTap: () {
                // Show the math keyboard when the text field is tapped
                showMathKeyboard(context, _controller);
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Add some spacing
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Display the entered expression when the button is pressed
                showDialog(
                  context: context,
                  builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                    title: Text('Entered Expression'),
                    content: Text(_controller.text), // Show the text from the controller
                    actions: [
                      TextButton(
                        onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(), // Close the dialog
                        child: Text('OK'),
                      ),
                    ],
                  ),
                );
              },
              child: Text('Submit'), // Button to submit the expression
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home widget is MathKeyboardHome, which contains the main UI.
// 4. In MathKeyboardHome, a TextField is created with a controller to manage input.
// 5. The default keyboard is disabled, and the math keyboard is shown on tap.
// 6. An ElevatedButton is provided to submit the entered expression.
// 7. When the button is pressed, an AlertDialog displays the entered expression from the text field.
```
