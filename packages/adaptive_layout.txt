# Setting Up the Adaptive Layout Package
==========================================

To use the `adaptive_layout` package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Pubspec File

Add the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  adaptive_layout: ^1.0.0
```
### Step 2: Import the Package

Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:adaptive_layout/adaptive_layout.dart';
```
### Step 3: Create a RealFlutter Widget

Create a `RealFlutter` widget that extends the `AdaptiveLayout` widget:
```dart
class RealFlutter extends AdaptiveLayout {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Your widget tree here
  }
}
```
### Platform-Specific Configurations

To configure platform-specific settings, use the ` AdaptiveLayout` widget's `android` and `ios` properties:
```dart
class RealFlutter extends AdaptiveLayout {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return AdaptiveLayout(
      android: AndroidConfig(
        // Android-specific settings here
      ),
      ios: IOSConfig(
        // iOS-specific settings here
      ),
      child: // Your widget tree here
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:adaptive_layout/adaptive_layout.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Adaptive Layout Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends AdaptiveLayout {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes
    return AdaptiveLayout(
      // Android-specific settings
      android: AndroidConfig(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Adaptive Layout Demo'),
        ),
      ),
      // iOS-specific settings
      ios: IOSConfig(
        tabBar: TabBar(
          tabs: [
            Tab(icon: Icon(Icons.home)),
            Tab(icon: Icon(Icons.settings)),
          ],
        ),
      ),
      // Common widget tree for both Android and iOS
      child: Scaffold(
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Hello, World!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application flow:
// 1. The app starts and runs the `main` function.
// 2. The `main` function creates a `MaterialApp` widget with a `RealFlutter` widget as its home.
// 3. The `RealFlutter` widget creates an `AdaptiveLayout` widget with Android and iOS-specific settings.
// 4. The `AdaptiveLayout` widget creates a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
// 5. The common widget tree is displayed on both Android and iOS devices.

// Summary:
// The code creates a responsive app that adapts to different screen sizes using the `adaptive_layout` package.
// The app uses Android and iOS-specific settings to configure the layout.
// The common widget tree is displayed on both Android and iOS devices.
