# Overview of the ff_annotation_route_library Flutter Package

The `ff_annotation_route_library` is a powerful Flutter package designed to simplify the process of routing and navigation in Flutter applications. It leverages annotations to define routes, making the code cleaner and more maintainable. This package is particularly useful for developers who want to streamline their navigation logic without the boilerplate code typically associated with Flutter's navigation system.

## When to Use This Package
- **Complex Navigation**: When your application has multiple screens and complex navigation flows.
- **Code Maintainability**: If you want to reduce boilerplate code and improve the readability of your routing logic.
- **Dynamic Routing**: When you need to pass parameters between routes easily.

## Key Features
- **Annotation-Based Routing**: Define routes using annotations, which reduces the need for manual route management.
- **Type Safety**: Ensures that the parameters passed between routes are type-checked at compile time.
- **Easy Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing Flutter applications without requiring significant changes to your architecture.

Overall, `ff_annotation_route_library` is an excellent choice for developers looking to enhance their Flutter navigation experience with a more structured and less error-prone approach.

# Setting Up and Using ff_annotation_route_library

## Installation
To get started with `ff_annotation_route_library`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ff_annotation_route_library: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/ff_annotation_route_library).

## Configuration
### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
}
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Podfile`.
2. Ensure that you have the following line uncommented:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Usage
To use the package, you need to create a class that extends `RealFlutter` and annotate your routes. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:ff_annotation_route_library/ff_annotation_route_library.dart';

part 'app_routes.g.dart'; // This is where the generated code will be placed.

@FFRoute(
  name: 'home',
  route: '/',
)
class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Welcome to Home Page')),
    );
  }
}

@FFRoute(
  name: 'details',
  route: '/details',
)
class DetailsPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Details')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Welcome to Details Page')),
    );
  }
}
```

After defining your routes, run the build command to generate the necessary routing code:

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build
```

This command will generate the `app_routes.g.dart` file, which contains the routing logic.

Now, you can navigate between pages using the generated routes:

```dart
Navigator.pushNamed(context, 'details');
```

This setup allows you to manage your routes efficiently and with less boilerplate code.

# Complete Example of Using ff_annotation_route_library

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ff_annotation_route_library/ff_annotation_route_library.dart';

part 'app_routes.g.dart'; // This is where the generated code will be placed.

@FFRoute(
  name: 'home',
  route: '/',
)
class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate to the details page using the generated route
            Navigator.pushNamed(context, 'details');
          },
          child: Text('Go to Details'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

@FFRoute(
  name: 'details',
  route: '/details',
)
class DetailsPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Details')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Welcome to Details Page')),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'FF Annotation Route Example',
      initialRoute: '/',
      onGenerateRoute: FFRouteGenerator.generateRoute, // Use the generated route
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the `main()` function, which runs the `MyApp` widget.
// 2. `MyApp` sets up the MaterialApp with an initial route of '/'.
// 3. The `HomePage` is displayed first, which contains a button.
// 4. When the button is pressed, it triggers navigation to the `DetailsPage` using the generated route.
// 5. The `DetailsPage` is displayed, showing a simple message.
