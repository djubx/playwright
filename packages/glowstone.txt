```
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configurations

## Using Glowstone
To use the Glowstone package, simply import it into your Dart file and create a `Glowstone` widget:
```dart
import 'package:glowstone/glowstone.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: Glowstone(
        child: Center(
          child: Text('Glowstone Demo'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:glowstone/glowstone.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a Glowstone widget with a custom color scheme
    return Glowstone(
      colors: [
        Colors.blue,
        Colors.green,
        Colors.red,
      ],
      child: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Glowstone Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Glowstone Demo'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app, which creates a RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a Glowstone widget with a custom color scheme.
// 3. The Glowstone widget creates an animated background with the specified colors.
// 4. The Scaffold widget is built on top of the Glowstone widget, with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. The Center widget contains a Text widget with the text 'Glowstone Demo'.
// 6. The animated background is displayed behind the Scaffold widget, creating a stunning visual effect.

// In summary, the code flows as follows:
// RealFlutter -> Glowstone -> Scaffold -> AppBar -> Center -> Text
