# Setting Up and Using the `camera_camera` Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `camera_camera` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application. We will cover platform-specific configurations for both Android and iOS.

## Setup

### 1. Add Dependency

Add the `camera_camera` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  camera_camera: ^0.0.1
```

### 2. Android Configuration

For Android, you need to add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```

Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### 3. iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file to request camera and microphone access:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to capture photos and videos.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone to record audio with your videos.</string>
```

## Using the Package

### Initializing the Camera

To use the camera, you need to initialize it within your Flutter application. The `RealFlutter` class will be our main class for handling camera operations.

### Capturing Photos and Videos

The package provides simple methods to capture photos and videos, switch cameras, and control the flash.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:camera_camera/camera_camera.dart';

void main() => runApp(RealFlutterApp());

class RealFlutterApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Camera Camera Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Camera Camera Example'),
      ),
      body: CameraCamera(
        onFile: (file) {
          // This callback is triggered when a photo or video is captured.
          // 'file' is the captured media file.
          print('Captured file: ${file.path}');
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The `RealFlutterApp` class initializes the Flutter application and sets up the main theme and home widget.
// The `RealFlutter` widget is a stateful widget that manages the camera interface.
// The `CameraCamera` widget is used to display the camera preview and handle media capture.
// The `onFile` callback is triggered when a photo or video is captured, providing the file path of the captured media.
