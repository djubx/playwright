# Complete Example of Using Groovin Widgets

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:groovin_widgets/groovin_widgets.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Groovin Widgets Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Groovin Widgets Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: GroovinButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Action to perform when the button is pressed
            ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
              SnackBar(content: Text('Button Pressed!')),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Click Me'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to HomePage, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 4. HomePage builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a GroovinButton is created.
// 6. When the button is pressed, a SnackBar is displayed at the bottom of the screen, indicating that the button was pressed.
```

### Final Summary

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application using the **groovin_widgets** package. The application consists of a button that, when pressed, shows a SnackBar message. The flow of the application is straightforward, starting from the `main` function, which initializes the app, to the `HomePage` widget that contains the Groovin Button. This demonstrates how easy it is to integrate and use the widgets provided by the **groovin_widgets** package in a Flutter application.
