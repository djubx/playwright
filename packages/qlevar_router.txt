<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Overview of the qlevar_router Flutter Package

The `qlevar_router` package is a powerful routing solution for Flutter applications, designed to simplify navigation and enhance the overall user experience. It provides a declarative way to define routes, making it easier to manage complex navigation scenarios.

## When to Use qlevar_router

You should consider using `qlevar_router` in your Flutter projects when:
- You need a flexible routing solution that supports nested routes.
- You want to manage route transitions and animations easily.
- You require a simple way to pass data between routes.
- You are building a large application with multiple screens and complex navigation logic.

## Key Features
- **Declarative Routing**: Define routes in a clear and concise manner.
- **Nested Routes**: Support for nested navigation, allowing for more complex UI structures.
- **Data Passing**: Easily pass data between routes.
- **Custom Transitions**: Define custom animations for route transitions.
- **Deep Linking**: Support for deep linking, enabling users to navigate directly to specific content.

With these features, `qlevar_router` makes it easier to build scalable and maintainable Flutter applications.

## Part 2: Tutorial

# Setting Up and Using qlevar_router

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with `qlevar_router`, add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  qlevar_router: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Basic Setup

After adding the dependency, you need to import the package in your Dart files:

```dart
import 'package:qlevar_router/qlevar_router.dart';
```

## Step 3: Defining Routes

You can define your routes in a centralized location. Hereâ€™s an example of how to set up routes in your application:

```dart
void main() {
  QRouter.init(routes: [
    QRoute(path: '/', builder: (context) => HomeScreen()),
    QRoute(path: '/details/:id', builder: (context) => DetailsScreen()),
  ]);
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android
- Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` is configured correctly to handle deep links if you plan to use them.

#### iOS
- For iOS, make sure to configure your app's Info.plist to support URL schemes if you are implementing deep linking.

## Step 4: Navigating Between Routes

To navigate between routes, you can use the `QRouter.to` method:

```dart
QRouter.to('/details/1'); // Navigates to the details screen with id 1
```

## Step 5: Passing Data Between Routes

You can pass data between routes using route parameters. For example, in the `DetailsScreen`, you can access the passed `id` like this:

```dart
final id = QRouter.param('id');
```

## Step 6: Custom Transitions

To add custom transitions, you can define them in your route configuration:

```dart
QRoute(
  path: '/details/:id',
  builder: (context) => DetailsScreen(),
  transition: Transition.fadeIn,
);
```

With these steps, you can effectively set up and use the `qlevar_router` package in your Flutter application.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
# Complete Example of qlevar_router

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:qlevar_router/qlevar_router.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the router with defined routes
  QRouter.init(routes: [
    QRoute(path: '/', builder: (context) => HomeScreen()),
    QRoute(path: '/details/:id', builder: (context) => DetailsScreen()),
  ]);
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Qlevar Router Example',
      initialRoute: '/',
      // Use QRouter's routing system
      onGenerateRoute: QRouter.generateRoute,
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate to details screen with id 1
            QRouter.to('/details/1');
          },
          child: Text('Go to Details'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DetailsScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Retrieve the id parameter from the route
    final id = QRouter.param('id');
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Details')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Details for item $id'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts in the main function, initializing the QRouter with defined routes.
// 2. The MyApp widget is built, setting up the MaterialApp with QRouter's routing system.
// 3. The HomeScreen is displayed, featuring a button to navigate to the DetailsScreen.
// 4. When the button is pressed, QRouter.to() is called with the path to the DetailsScreen, passing an id parameter.
// 5. The DetailsScreen retrieves the id parameter using QRouter.param() and displays it on the screen.
```
