# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Video Compress Plus

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `video_compress_plus` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  video_compress_plus: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the current version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version required
    }
}
```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to select videos.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to record videos.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone to record audio.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that the package is set up, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to compress a video.

# Complete Example of Using Video Compress Plus

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:video_compress_plus/video_compress_plus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Video Compress Plus Example',
      home: VideoCompressPage(),
    );
  }
}

class VideoCompressPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _VideoCompressPageState createState() => _VideoCompressPageState();
}

class _VideoCompressPageState extends State<VideoCompressPage> {
  String? _compressedVideoPath;

  // Function to compress video
  Future<void> _compressVideo(String videoPath) async {
    // Start the compression process
    final compressedVideo = await VideoCompress.compressVideo(
      videoPath,
      quality: VideoQuality.MediumQuality, // Set the quality
      deleteOrigin: false, // Keep the original video
    );

    // Update the state with the compressed video path
    setState(() {
      _compressedVideoPath = compressedVideo?.path;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Video Compress Plus Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () async {
                // Replace with the path of the video you want to compress
                String videoPath = 'path_to_your_video.mp4';
                await _compressVideo(videoPath);
              },
              child: Text('Compress Video'),
            ),
            if (_compressedVideoPath != null) 
              Text('Compressed Video Path: $_compressedVideoPath'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home page (VideoCompressPage).
// 3. VideoCompressPage is a stateful widget that manages the state of the video compression process.
// 4. When the "Compress Video" button is pressed, it triggers the _compressVideo function.
// 5. The _compressVideo function calls the compressVideo method from the video_compress_plus package,
//    specifying the video path and desired quality.
// 6. Once the compression is complete, the state is updated with the path of the compressed video,
//    which is displayed on the screen.
```
