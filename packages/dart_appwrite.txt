# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Dart Appwrite

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `dart_appwrite` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `dart_appwrite` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dart_appwrite: ^0.9.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Configure Appwrite

### 2.1 Create an Appwrite Project

1. Go to the [Appwrite console](https://appwrite.io/).
2. Create a new project and note the project ID and API endpoint.

### 2.2 Set Up API Keys

1. In the Appwrite console, navigate to the "API Keys" section.
2. Create a new API key with the necessary permissions for your application.

### 2.3 Configure Android

For Android, ensure you have the following in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<manifest>
    <application>
        <meta-data
            android:name="appwrite.api.endpoint"
            android:value="https://YOUR_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT/v1" />
        <meta-data
            android:name="appwrite.project.id"
            android:value="YOUR_PROJECT_ID" />
    </application>
</manifest>
```

### 2.4 Configure iOS

For iOS, add the following to your `Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>appwrite.api.endpoint</key>
<string>https://YOUR_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT/v1</string>
<key>appwrite.project.id</key>
<string>YOUR_PROJECT_ID</string>
```

## Step 3: Initialize the Appwrite Client

In your Flutter application, initialize the Appwrite client in the `main.dart` file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dart_appwrite/dart_appwrite.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the Appwrite client
  Client client = Client()
      .setEndpoint('https://YOUR_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT/v1') // Your API Endpoint
      .setProject('YOUR_PROJECT_ID'); // Your project ID

  runApp(MyApp(client: client));
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  final Client client;

  MyApp({required this.client});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dart Appwrite Example',
      home: HomeScreen(client: client),
    );
  }
}
```

Now you can use the `client` instance to interact with Appwrite services.

# Complete Example: Dart Appwrite Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dart_appwrite/dart_appwrite.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the Appwrite client
  Client client = Client()
      .setEndpoint('https://YOUR_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT/v1') // Your API Endpoint
      .setProject('YOUR_PROJECT_ID'); // Your project ID

  runApp(MyApp(client: client));
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  final Client client;

  MyApp({required this.client});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dart Appwrite Example',
      home: HomeScreen(client: client),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  final Client client;

  HomeScreen({required this.client});

  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  late Account account; // Account service for user management
  late String userName; // Variable to hold the user's name

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    account = Account(widget.client); // Initialize the Account service
    userName = ''; // Initialize userName
  }

  // Function to sign in the user
  Future<void> signIn() async {
    try {
      // Replace with your own user credentials
      final user = await account.create('user@example.com', 'password');
      setState(() {
        userName = user.name; // Set the user's name
      });
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error signing in: $e'); // Handle errors
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Dart Appwrite Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              userName.isNotEmpty ? 'Hello, $userName!' : 'Please sign in.',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: signIn, // Call signIn function on button press
              child: Text('Sign In'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Appwrite client with the API endpoint and project ID.
// 2. MyApp is the root widget that sets up the MaterialApp and passes the client to HomeScreen.
// 3. HomeScreen initializes the Account service and manages user sign-in.
// 4. The signIn function attempts to create a user account and updates the UI with the user's name.
// 5. The UI displays a greeting message or prompts the user to sign in, depending on the authentication state.
```
