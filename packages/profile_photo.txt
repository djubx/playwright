# Profile Photo Flutter Package

The **profile_photo** Flutter package is a versatile and user-friendly library designed to simplify the process of displaying user profile images in Flutter applications. It provides a range of features that enhance the user experience, such as customizable placeholders, error handling, and support for various image sources.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the **profile_photo** package in scenarios where:
- You need to display user profile images in your app, such as in social media applications, messaging apps, or user account settings.

- You require customization options for the appearance of the profile images, including shapes, borders, and sizes.

## Key Features
- **Customizable Placeholder**: Easily set a default image to display when the user's profile photo is unavailable.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Profile Photo Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **profile_photo** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **profile_photo** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  profile_photo: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to access the internet if you are loading images from a URL. Add the following line inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add permissions for network access in your `Info.plist` file. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Profile Photo Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the **profile_photo** widget.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:profile_photo/profile_photo.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Profile Photo Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ProfilePhoto(
            name: 'John Doe', // User's name for the placeholder
            image: NetworkImage('https://example.com/profile.jpg'), // User's profile image URL
            size: 100.0, // Size of the profile photo
            shape: BoxShape.circle, // Shape of the profile photo
            backgroundColor: Colors.grey[300], // Background color for the placeholder
            errorWidget: Icon(Icons.error), // Widget to display on error
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays a user's profile photo. The `ProfilePhoto` widget takes several parameters, including the user's name, image source, size, shape, background color, and an error widget.

# Complete Example of Using the Profile Photo Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:profile_photo/profile_photo.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Profile Photo Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ProfilePhoto(
            name: 'John Doe', // User's name for the placeholder
            image: NetworkImage('https://example.com/profile.jpg'), // User's profile image URL
            size: 100.0, // Size of the profile photo
            shape: BoxShape.circle, // Shape of the profile photo
            backgroundColor: Colors.grey[300], // Background color for the placeholder
            errorWidget: Icon(Icons.error), // Widget to display on error
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application, which calls runApp() to start the app.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the main UI of the app.
// 3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. The Center widget holds the ProfilePhoto widget, which displays the user's profile image.
// 5. The ProfilePhoto widget takes parameters such as name, image source, size, shape, background color, and error widget.
// 6. If the image loads successfully, it displays the profile photo; if it fails, it shows the error widget (an error icon).
// 7. The app runs and displays the profile photo in the center of the screen.
