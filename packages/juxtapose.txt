# Setting Up and Using Juxtapose
=============================

### Step 1: Add the Juxtapose Package to Your Flutter Project

Add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  juxtapose: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Juxtapose Package

Import the Juxtapose package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:juxtapose/juxtapose.dart';
```

### Step 3: Create a Juxtapose Widget

Create a Juxtapose widget and pass in the two images or widgets you want to compare:

```dart
Juxtapose(
  leftChild: Image.asset('assets/image1.jpg'),
  rightChild: Image.asset('assets/image2.jpg'),
)
```

### Step 4: Customize the Juxtapose Widget (Optional)

You can customize the Juxtapose widget by passing in additional properties, such as the slider color and the layout:

```dart
Juxtapose(
  leftChild: Image.asset('assets/image1.jpg'),
  rightChild: Image.asset('assets/image2.jpg'),
  sliderColor: Colors.blue,
  layout: JuxtaposeLayout.horizontal,
)
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:juxtapose/juxtapose.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Juxtapose Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Juxtapose Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Juxtapose(
          // Pass in the two images to compare
          leftChild: Image.asset('assets/image1.jpg'),
          rightChild: Image.asset('assets/image2.jpg'),
          // Customize the slider color
          sliderColor: Colors.blue,
          // Customize the layout
          layout: JuxtaposeLayout.horizontal,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a Juxtapose widget.
// 2. The Juxtapose widget displays two images side-by-side.
// 3. The user can interact with the slider to compare the differences between the two images.
// 4. The slider can be moved horizontally to compare the images.
// 5. The application displays the differences between the two images in real-time.

// In summary, this code creates a simple Juxtapose demo app that allows users to compare two images side-by-side using an interactive slider.
