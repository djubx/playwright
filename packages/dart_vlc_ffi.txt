### Description

The `dart_vlc_ffi` package is a powerful Flutter plugin that provides bindings to the VLC media player library using Foreign Function Interface (FFI). This package allows developers to integrate VLC's extensive media playback capabilities directly into their Flutter applications, enabling support for a wide range of audio and video formats.

### When to Use

You might consider using `dart_vlc_ffi` in scenarios such as:
- Building a media player application that requires support for various file formats.
- Creating a video streaming app that needs robust playback features.
- Developing applications that require advanced media controls, such as seeking, pausing, and volume adjustments.

### Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS, leveraging the native capabilities of VLC.
- **Media Playback**: Supports a wide range of audio and video formats.
- **Control Features**: Provides methods for play, pause, stop, seek, and volume control.

### Tutorial

To get started with the `dart_vlc_ffi` package, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the `dart_vlc_ffi` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dart_vlc_ffi: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/dart_vlc_ffi).

#### Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

**For Android:**
1. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Add the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

**For iOS:**
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to play videos.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio playback.</string>
```

#### Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:dart_vlc_ffi/dart_vlc_ffi.dart';
```

#### Step 4: Initialize VLC

Before using the package, initialize VLC in your main application file:

```dart
void main() {
  DartVLC.initialize();
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

### Usage Example

You can now use the `dart_vlc_ffi` package to create a simple media player. Refer to the complete example below for a practical implementation.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dart_vlc_ffi/dart_vlc_ffi.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the Dart VLC library
  DartVLC.initialize();
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Create a VLC media player instance
  late final MediaPlayer _mediaPlayer;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the media player with a media source
    _mediaPlayer = MediaPlayer(
      Media.file('path_to_your_media_file.mp4'), // Replace with your media file path
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the media player when the widget is removed
    _mediaPlayer.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Dart VLC FFI Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Play the media
                  _mediaPlayer.play();
                },
                child: Text('Play'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Pause the media
                  _mediaPlayer.pause();
                },
                child: Text('Pause'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Stop the media
                  _mediaPlayer.stop();
                },
                child: Text('Stop'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Seek to 10 seconds
                  _mediaPlayer.seek(Duration(seconds: 10));
                },
                child: Text('Seek to 10s'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation

// The application starts by initializing the Dart VLC library in the main function.
// A stateful widget `RealFlutter` is created to manage the media player state.
// In the `initState` method, a `MediaPlayer` instance is initialized with a media file.
// The `dispose` method ensures that the media player is properly disposed of when the widget is removed.
// The UI consists of a simple layout with buttons to control media playback: Play, Pause, Stop, and Seek.
// Each button triggers the corresponding method on the `_mediaPlayer` instance to control playback.
// The media file path should be replaced with a valid path to test the functionality.
