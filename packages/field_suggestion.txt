# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Field Suggestion Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **field_suggestion** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **field_suggestion** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  field_suggestion: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that the package is set up, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a suggestion field using the **field_suggestion** package.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:field_suggestion/field_suggestion.dart';
```

2. Create a StatefulWidget to manage the state of the suggestion field.

3. Use the `FieldSuggestion` widget to display suggestions based on user input.

This will be demonstrated in the complete example section below.

# Complete Example of Using Field Suggestion

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:field_suggestion/field_suggestion.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Field Suggestion Example',
      home: SuggestionPage(),
    );
  }
}

class SuggestionPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SuggestionPageState createState() => _SuggestionPageState();
}

class _SuggestionPageState extends State<SuggestionPage> {
  // List of suggestions to display
  final List<String> _suggestions = [
    'Apple',
    'Banana',
    'Cherry',
    'Date',
    'Elderberry',
    'Fig',
    'Grape',
  ];

  // Controller for the text field
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController();

  // Variable to hold the filtered suggestions
  List<String> _filteredSuggestions = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the filtered suggestions with all suggestions
    _filteredSuggestions = _suggestions;
  }

  // Method to filter suggestions based on user input
  void _filterSuggestions(String query) {
    if (query.isEmpty) {
      // If the query is empty, show all suggestions
      setState(() {
        _filteredSuggestions = _suggestions;
      });
    } else {
      // Filter suggestions based on the query
      setState(() {
        _filteredSuggestions = _suggestions
            .where((suggestion) =>
                suggestion.toLowerCase().contains(query.toLowerCase()))
            .toList();
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Field Suggestion Example'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            // Text field for user input
            TextField(
              controller: _controller,
              onChanged: _filterSuggestions, // Call filter method on change
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Type a fruit',
                border: OutlineInputBorder(),
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 10),
            // Displaying the filtered suggestions
            Expanded(
              child: ListView.builder(
                itemCount: _filteredSuggestions.length,
                itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                  return ListTile(
                    title: Text(_filteredSuggestions[index]),
                    onTap: () {
                      // Set the selected suggestion in the text field
                      _controller.text = _filteredSuggestions[index];
                      // Clear suggestions after selection
                      setState(() {
                        _filteredSuggestions = _suggestions;
                      });
                    },
                  );
                },
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and home page set to SuggestionPage.
// 3. SuggestionPage is a StatefulWidget that manages the state of the suggestion field.
// 4. It initializes a list of suggestions and a TextEditingController.
// 5. The _filterSuggestions method filters the suggestions based on user input.
// 6. The build method creates a TextField for user input and a ListView to display filtered suggestions.
// 7. When the user types in the TextField, the _filterSuggestions method is called to update the suggestions.
// 8. Tapping on a suggestion sets it in the TextField and resets the suggestions list.
