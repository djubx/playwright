# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using h_alert_dialog

## Installation
To get started with the `h_alert_dialog` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  h_alert_dialog: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Usage
### Basic Setup
To use the `h_alert_dialog` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:h_alert_dialog/h_alert_dialog.dart';
```

### Displaying a Simple Alert Dialog
You can display a simple alert dialog using the following code snippet:

```dart
void showAlert(BuildContext context) {
  HAlertDialog(
    title: 'Alert',
    content: 'This is a simple alert dialog.',
    onConfirm: () {
      Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
    },
  ).show(context);
}
```

### Platform-Specific Considerations
- **Android**: Ensure that your app has the necessary permissions if you are using dialogs that require user input or confirmation.
- **iOS**: Make sure to test the dialogs on actual devices, as the appearance may differ from the simulator.

### Customization Options
You can customize the dialog's appearance by providing additional parameters such as `backgroundColor`, `titleStyle`, and `contentStyle`.

```dart
HAlertDialog(
  title: 'Custom Alert',
  content: 'This dialog has a custom style.',
  backgroundColor: Colors.white,
  titleStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.blue, fontSize: 20),
  contentStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.black54),
  onConfirm: () {
    Navigator.of(context).pop();
  },
).show(context);
```

# Complete Example of h_alert_dialog

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:h_alert_dialog/h_alert_dialog.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'h_alert_dialog Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('h_alert_dialog Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Trigger the alert dialog when the button is pressed
              showAlert(context);
            },
            child: Text('Show Alert Dialog'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void showAlert(BuildContext context) {
    // Create and show the alert dialog
    HAlertDialog(
      title: 'Alert',
      content: 'This is a simple alert dialog.',
      onConfirm: () {
        // Close the dialog when confirmed
        Navigator.of(context).pop();
      },
    ).show(context);
  }
}
```

// The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// Inside the Scaffold, there's an AppBar with the title 'h_alert_dialog Example'.
// The body contains a Center widget with an ElevatedButton.
// When the button is pressed, the showAlert function is called, which creates and displays an HAlertDialog.
// The dialog has a title and content, and when the user confirms, it closes the dialog using Navigator.pop().
