// This code creates a basic Flutter application with a button that displays an alert dialog when pressed.
// The alert dialog is created using the HAlertDialog widget and displays a title, content, and an OK button.
// When the OK button is pressed, the alert dialog is dismissed.
// The code demonstrates how to use the h_alert_dialog package to display an alert dialog in a Flutter application.

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user presses the "Show Alert Dialog" button.
// 2. The HAlertDialog widget is created and displayed.
// 3. The user presses the OK button.
// 4. The alert dialog is dismissed.
