# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Widget to Marker Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `widget_to_marker` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  widget_to_marker: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request location permissions:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your location.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your location.</string>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to convert a widget into a marker.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:widget_to_marker/widget_to_marker.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a simple widget to use as a marker
    final markerWidget = Container(
      padding: EdgeInsets.all(8),
      decoration: BoxDecoration(
        color: Colors.blue,
        borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(10),
      ),
      child: Text(
        'Marker',
        style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
      ),
    );

    // Convert the widget to a marker
    final marker = WidgetToMarker.convert(markerWidget);

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Widget to Marker Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: marker, // Display the marker
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple blue container with text and convert it into a marker using the `WidgetToMarker.convert` method.

# Complete Example of Using Widget to Marker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:widget_to_marker/widget_to_marker.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Step 1: Create a widget to use as a marker
    final markerWidget = Container(
      padding: EdgeInsets.all(8),
      decoration: BoxDecoration(
        color: Colors.blue,
        borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(10),
      ),
      child: Text(
        'Marker',
        style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
      ),
    );

    // Step 2: Convert the widget to a marker
    final marker = WidgetToMarker.convert(markerWidget);

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Widget to Marker Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: marker, // Step 3: Display the marker
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    home: RealFlutter(),
  ));
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget, we create a custom marker widget using a Container with padding and a blue background.
// 3. We convert this widget into a marker using the WidgetToMarker.convert method.
// 4. Finally, we display the marker in the center of the screen within a Scaffold.
// 5. This setup allows for easy customization of the marker's appearance and behavior.
```
