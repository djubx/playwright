## Basic Usage
To use the `flappy_search_bar_ns` package, you need to create a search bar and integrate it with a list of items. Below is a simple example of how to implement it in your Flutter app.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flappy_search_bar_ns/flappy_search_bar_ns.dart';
```

2. Create a stateful widget that will hold the search bar and the list of items.

3. Implement the search logic to fetch and filter the data based on user input.

This setup will allow you to create a functional search bar that enhances user experience in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Flappy Search Bar NS

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flappy_search_bar_ns/flappy_search_bar_ns.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flappy Search Bar NS Example',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: SearchPage(),
    );
  }
}

class SearchPage extends StatelessWidget {
  // Sample data to search through
  final List<String> items = [
    "Apple",
    "Banana",
    "Cherry",
    "Date",
    "Elderberry",
    "Fig",
    "Grape",
    "Honeydew"
  ];

  // Function to perform the search
  Future<List<String>> search(String query) async {
    // Simulate a delay for fetching data
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1));
    // Filter the items based on the query
    return items
        .where((item) => item.toLowerCase().contains(query.toLowerCase()))
        .toList();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flappy Search Bar NS')),
      body: SearchBar<String>(
        onSearch: search, // Assign the search function
        onItemFound: (String item) {
          // Display each found item
          return ListTile(
            title: Text(item),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to SearchPage.
// 4. In SearchPage, a list of sample items is defined.
// 5. The search function filters the items based on the user's query.
// 6. The SearchBar widget is created, which takes the search function and a callback for displaying found items.
// 7. When the user types in the search bar, the search function is called, and the results are displayed in a ListTile format.
