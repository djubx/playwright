In summary, the code flows as follows: The user opens the app and is presented with a search bar. The user types in a search query and the `onSearch` callback is called. The `onSearch` callback handles the search input and prints it to the console. The user is presented with search suggestions below the search bar. The user taps on a search suggestion and the `onTap` callback is called. The `onTap` callback handles the suggestion tap and prints a message to the console.
