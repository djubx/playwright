# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Adjusted HTML View Web

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `adjusted_html_view_web` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter web application.

## Step 1: Adding the Package to Your Project
To get started, you need to add the `adjusted_html_view_web` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  adjusted_html_view_web: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/adjusted_html_view_web).

## Step 2: Running Flutter Pub Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package
In your Dart file where you want to use the package, import it as follows:

```dart
import 'package:adjusted_html_view_web/adjusted_html_view_web.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package
You can now use the `AdjustedHtmlView` widget to display HTML content. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
AdjustedHtmlView(
  data: '<h1>Hello, World!</h1><p>This is a sample HTML content.</p>',
  style: {
    "h1": Style(color: Colors.blue),
    "p": Style(fontSize: FontSize(16)),
  },
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details
- **Web**: The package is optimized for web applications, ensuring that HTML content is rendered correctly across different browsers.
- **No Additional Configuration Needed**: For web applications, no additional configurations are required beyond adding the package.

## Step 5: Testing Your Application
Run your Flutter web application using the following command:

```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

This will launch your application in the Chrome browser, where you can see the rendered HTML content.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate and use the `adjusted_html_view_web` package in your Flutter web applications effectively.

# Complete Example of Using Adjusted HTML View Web

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:adjusted_html_view_web/adjusted_html_view_web.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Adjusted HTML View Web Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('HTML View Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: AdjustedHtmlView(
            // The HTML content to be displayed
            data: '<h1>Hello, World!</h1><p>This is a sample HTML content.</p>',
            // Custom styles for the HTML elements
            style: {
              "h1": Style(color: Colors.blue), // Style for h1 elements
              "p": Style(fontSize: FontSize(16)), // Style for p elements
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'HTML View Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains the AdjustedHtmlView widget.
// 5. The AdjustedHtmlView widget takes HTML data as a string and applies custom styles to the h1 and p elements.
// 6. When the application runs, it displays the HTML content with the specified styles in the center of the screen.
