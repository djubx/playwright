# Vibration Web Flutter Package

The `vibration_web` package is a Flutter plugin that allows developers to utilize vibration feedback in web applications. This package is particularly useful for enhancing user experience by providing tactile feedback during interactions, such as button presses or notifications. 

## When to Use This Package
- **User Feedback**: To provide immediate feedback to users when they perform actions, such as tapping buttons or completing tasks.
- **Game Development**: To enhance the gaming experience by adding vibration effects during gameplay.
- **Accessibility**: To improve accessibility by providing additional sensory feedback for users with visual impairments.

## Features
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly across web platforms.
- **Simple API**: Easy to integrate and use within Flutter applications.
- **Customizable Vibration Patterns**: Allows developers to define specific vibration patterns for different actions.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Vibration Web

## Installation
To get started with the `vibration_web` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  vibration_web: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/vibration_web).

## Platform-Specific Details
### Web Configuration
For web applications, ensure that your project is set up to support the necessary permissions for vibration. Most modern browsers support the Vibration API, but it's good practice to check compatibility.

### Permissions
No special permissions are required for web applications, but users should be aware that vibration may not work on all devices or browsers.

## Using the Package
To use the `vibration_web` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:vibration_web/vibration_web.dart';
```

You can then call the vibration methods provided by the package. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to trigger a vibration:

```dart
void triggerVibration() {
  Vibration.vibrate(duration: 500); // Vibrate for 500 milliseconds
}
```

This method can be called in response to user interactions, such as button presses.

# Complete Example of Vibration Web in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:vibration_web/vibration_web.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Vibration Web Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Vibration Web Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Trigger vibration when the button is pressed
              triggerVibration();
            },
            child: Text('Vibrate'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to trigger vibration
  void triggerVibration() {
    // Check if vibration is supported
    if (Vibration.hasVibrator()) {
      // Vibrate for 500 milliseconds
      Vibration.vibrate(duration: 500);
    } else {
      // Handle the case where vibration is not supported
      print('Vibration not supported on this device.');
    }
  }
}
```

```
// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Vibration Web Example'.
// 4. In the body of the Scaffold, a Center widget is used to center the content.
// 5. An ElevatedButton is created, which triggers the triggerVibration() function when pressed.
// 6. The triggerVibration() function checks if the device has a vibrator using Vibration.hasVibrator().
// 7. If vibration is supported, it calls Vibration.vibrate(duration: 500) to vibrate for 500 milliseconds.
// 8. If vibration is not supported, it prints a message to the console.
