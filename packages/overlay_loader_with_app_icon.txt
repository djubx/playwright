# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Overlay Loader with App Icon

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `overlay_loader_with_app_icon` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  overlay_loader_with_app_icon: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:overlay_loader_with_app_icon/overlay_loader_with_app_icon.dart';
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions if you are performing network operations:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you are accessing the internet:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Using the Overlay Loader

You can now use the overlay loader in your application. Here’s a simple example of how to show the loader while performing a network request:

```dart
void fetchData() async {
  // Show the overlay loader with the app icon
  OverlayLoader.show();
  
  // Simulate a network request
  await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3));
  
  // Hide the overlay loader
  OverlayLoader.hide();
}
```

## Step 5: Customizing the Loader

You can customize the loader by passing parameters such as the icon and message:

```dart
OverlayLoader.show(
  icon: Icons.cloud_download,
  message: "Loading data...",
);
```

With these steps, you can effectively integrate the `overlay_loader_with_app_icon` package into your Flutter application, providing a smooth user experience during loading times.

# Complete Example of Overlay Loader with App Icon

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:overlay_loader_with_app_icon/overlay_loader_with_app_icon.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Overlay Loader Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Overlay Loader Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: fetchData, // Trigger the fetchData function on button press
            child: Text('Fetch Data'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to simulate data fetching
  void fetchData() async {
    // Show the overlay loader with the app icon
    OverlayLoader.show(
      icon: Icons.cloud_download, // Custom icon for the loader
      message: "Loading data...", // Custom message for the loader
    );
    
    // Simulate a network request with a delay
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3));
    
    // Hide the overlay loader after the task is complete
    OverlayLoader.hide();
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, there's an AppBar and a Center widget containing an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the fetchData function is called.
// 5. The fetchData function shows the overlay loader with a custom icon and message.
// 6. It then simulates a network request with a 3-second delay.
// 7. After the delay, the overlay loader is hidden, indicating that the loading process is complete.
