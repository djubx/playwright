# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Reactive File Picker

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `reactive_file_picker` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the `reactive_file_picker` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  reactive_file_picker: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/reactive_file_picker).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
For Android, you need to ensure that you have the necessary permissions to read external storage. Open the `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration
For iOS, you need to add a usage description for accessing the photo library. Open the `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following key:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your photo library to select images.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the file picker.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:reactive_file_picker/reactive_file_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Reactive File Picker Example',
      home: FilePickerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class FilePickerScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('File Picker Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () async {
            // Trigger the file picker when the button is pressed
            final result = await ReactiveFilePicker.pickFile();
            if (result != null) {
              // If a file is selected, display its path
              showDialog(
                context: context,
                builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                  title: Text('File Selected'),
                  content: Text('File path: ${result.path}'),
                  actions: [
                    TextButton(
                      onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                      child: Text('OK'),
                    ),
                  ],
                ),
              );
            }
          },
          child: Text('Pick a File'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (FilePickerScreen).
// 3. FilePickerScreen contains a button that, when pressed, triggers the file picker.
// 4. The file picker opens, allowing the user to select a file.
// 5. If a file is selected, its path is displayed in a dialog box.
// 6. The user can dismiss the dialog by pressing the 'OK' button.
```
