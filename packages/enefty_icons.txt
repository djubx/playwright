# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `enefty_icons`

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up the `enefty_icons` package in a Flutter project and demonstrate how to use it effectively.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `enefty_icons` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  enefty_icons: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the icons, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:enefty_icons/enefty_icons.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Icons

You can now use the icons in your Flutter widgets. Hereâ€™s an example of how to use an icon from the `enefty_icons` package:

```dart
Icon(
  EnefityIcons.exampleIcon, // Replace with the actual icon name
  size: 30.0, // Set the size of the icon
  color: Colors.blue, // Set the color of the icon
)
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Optimizations

To optimize the performance of your app when using custom icons, consider the following:
- Use vector graphics where possible to reduce the size of your assets.
- Cache icons if they are used frequently to improve loading times.

By following these steps, you can successfully integrate and utilize the `enefty_icons` package in your Flutter application.

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:enefty_icons/enefty_icons.dart'; // Importing the package

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp()); // Running the main application
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Enefty Icons Example', // Title of the application
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue, // Setting the primary color
      ),
      home: HomePage(), // Setting the home page
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Enefty Icons Demo'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center, // Centering the column
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Using Enefty Icons:', // Text label
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20), // Text style
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space
            Icon(
              EnefityIcons.exampleIcon, // Using an icon from the package
              size: 50.0, // Setting the icon size
              color: Colors.blue, // Setting the icon color
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action when button is pressed
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Button Pressed!')), // SnackBar message
                );
              },
              child: Text('Press Me'), // Button label
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with MyApp().
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp has a title and a theme, and it sets HomePage as the home widget.
// 4. HomePage is a StatelessWidget that builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the Text, Icon, and ElevatedButton vertically.
// 6. The Icon widget displays an icon from the enefty_icons package, styled with size and color.
// 7. The ElevatedButton shows a SnackBar message when pressed, providing user feedback.
