# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Non-Uniform Border Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **non_uniform_border** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  non_uniform_border: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:non_uniform_border/non_uniform_border.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using Non-Uniform Borders

You can now use the `NonUniformBorder` widget to create custom borders. Below is an example of how to implement it in a Flutter application.

### Platform-Specific Details

- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid compatibility issues.
  
  ```gradle
  android {
      ...
      defaultConfig {
          ...
          minSdkVersion 21
      }
  }
  ```

- **iOS**: No specific configurations are required for iOS, but ensure that your deployment target is set appropriately in `ios/Podfile`.

## Step 4: Example Usage

You can use the `NonUniformBorder` widget as follows:

```dart
NonUniformBorder(
  top: BorderSide(width: 5.0, color: Colors.red),
  right: BorderSide(width: 2.0, color: Colors.green),
  bottom: BorderSide(width: 3.0, color: Colors.blue),
  left: BorderSide(width: 1.0, color: Colors.yellow),
  child: Container(
    padding: EdgeInsets.all(20.0),
    child: Text('Hello, Non-Uniform Border!'),
  ),
);
```

This code snippet creates a container with a non-uniform border, where each side has a different color and width.

With these steps, you can easily set up and start using the **non_uniform_border** package in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Non-Uniform Border in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:non_uniform_border/non_uniform_border.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Non-Uniform Border Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Non-Uniform Border Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: NonUniformBorder(
            // Setting different border styles for each side
            top: BorderSide(width: 5.0, color: Colors.red), // Top border
            right: BorderSide(width: 2.0, color: Colors.green), // Right border
            bottom: BorderSide(width: 3.0, color: Colors.blue), // Bottom border
            left: BorderSide(width: 1.0, color: Colors.yellow), // Left border
            child: Container(
              // Inner container with padding and background color
              padding: EdgeInsets.all(20.0),
              color: Colors.white,
              child: Text(
                'Hello, Non-Uniform Border!',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the Flutter application by calling runApp() with MyApp().
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, we use the NonUniformBorder widget to create a custom border.
// 5. Each side of the border is defined with different colors and widths.
// 6. The child of the NonUniformBorder is a Container that holds a Text widget.
// 7. The Container has padding and a white background, making the text readable.
// 8. The result is a visually appealing widget with a non-uniform border that enhances the UI.
```
