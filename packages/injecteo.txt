# Overview of the Injecteo Flutter Package

The **Injecteo** package is a powerful dependency injection library for Flutter that simplifies the management of dependencies in your applications. It allows developers to easily manage the lifecycle of their objects, making it easier to write clean, maintainable, and testable code. 

## When to Use Injecteo
Injecteo is particularly useful in scenarios where:
- You have multiple classes that depend on shared resources or services.
- You want to decouple your code to improve testability.
- You need to manage the lifecycle of your objects efficiently.

## Key Features
- **Simple API**: Injecteo provides a straightforward API for registering and resolving dependencies.
- **Scoped Instances**: You can create scoped instances that are only available within a specific context.
- **Lazy Loading**: Dependencies can be lazily loaded, improving performance by only creating instances when needed.
- **Support for Async Initialization**: Injecteo supports asynchronous initialization of dependencies, which is crucial for network calls or database connections.

Overall, Injecteo is an excellent choice for Flutter developers looking to implement dependency injection in a clean and efficient manner.

# Setting Up and Using Injecteo

## Installation
To add Injecteo to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  injecteo: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/injecteo).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
Injecteo does not require any specific platform configurations for Android or iOS. However, ensure that your Flutter environment is set up correctly for both platforms.

## Basic Usage
1. **Creating a Service**: Define a service that you want to inject.

```dart
class ApiService {
  void fetchData() {
    // Simulate fetching data from an API
    print("Data fetched from API");
  }
}
```

2. **Registering the Service**: Use Injecteo to register your service.

```dart
import 'package:injecteo/injecteo.dart';

void main() {
  // Register the ApiService
  Injecteo.register<ApiService>(() => ApiService());
}
```

3. **Injecting the Service**: Now you can inject the service into your classes.

```dart
class RealFlutter {
  final ApiService apiService;

  RealFlutter(this.apiService);

  void performAction() {
    apiService.fetchData();
  }
}
```

4. **Using the Injected Service**: Finally, create an instance of `RealFlutter` and use it.

```dart
void main() {
  Injecteo.register<ApiService>(() => ApiService());
  
  final apiService = Injecteo.get<ApiService>();
  final app = RealFlutter(apiService);
  app.performAction(); // This will print "Data fetched from API"
}
```

With these steps, you can easily set up and use Injecteo in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Injecteo in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:injecteo/injecteo.dart';

// Define a simple service class
class ApiService {
  void fetchData() {
    // Simulate fetching data from an API
    print("Data fetched from API");
  }
}

// Main application class
class RealFlutter {
  final ApiService apiService;

  // Constructor that takes an ApiService instance
  RealFlutter(this.apiService);

  // Method to perform an action using the injected service
  void performAction() {
    apiService.fetchData();
  }
}

// Main function to run the app
void main() {
  // Register the ApiService with Injecteo
  Injecteo.register<ApiService>(() => ApiService());

  // Create an instance of ApiService using Injecteo
  final apiService = Injecteo.get<ApiService>();

  // Create an instance of RealFlutter with the injected ApiService
  final app = RealFlutter(apiService);

  // Perform an action that uses the ApiService
  app.performAction(); // This will print "Data fetched from API"

  // Run the Flutter app
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// Define a simple Flutter app
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Injecteo Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Injecteo Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Check the console for output!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts by registering the ApiService with Injecteo.
// 2. It then retrieves an instance of ApiService using Injecteo.get<ApiService>().
// 3. An instance of RealFlutter is created, passing the ApiService instance to it.
// 4. The performAction method is called, which in turn calls fetchData on the ApiService.
// 5. The fetchData method simulates an API call and prints a message to the console.
// 6. Finally, the Flutter app is run, displaying a simple UI with a message.
