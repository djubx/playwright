# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using ccp_dialog

## Installation
To get started with the `ccp_dialog` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ccp_dialog: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/ccp_dialog).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` file to allow for certain dialog functionalities, especially if you are using features that require permissions.

## Basic Usage
To use the `ccp_dialog` package, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:ccp_dialog/ccp_dialog.dart';
```

You can then create and show a dialog using the following code snippet:

```dart
void showAlertDialog(BuildContext context) {
  CcpDialog.alert(
    context: context,
    title: 'Alert Title',
    message: 'This is an alert message.',
    onConfirm: () {
      // Handle confirmation action
    },
  );
}
```

This function can be called from anywhere in your widget tree, such as in response to a button press.

# Complete Example of ccp_dialog in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ccp_dialog/ccp_dialog.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'ccp_dialog Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('ccp_dialog Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Show the alert dialog when the button is pressed
              showAlertDialog(context);
            },
            child: Text('Show Alert Dialog'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void showAlertDialog(BuildContext context) {
    // Create and show an alert dialog using ccp_dialog
    CcpDialog.alert(
      context: context,
      title: 'Alert Title',
      message: 'This is an alert message.',
      onConfirm: () {
        // Action to perform on confirmation
        print('Confirmed!');
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'ccp_dialog Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 5. An ElevatedButton is displayed, which, when pressed, triggers the showAlertDialog function.
// 6. The showAlertDialog function creates an alert dialog using the ccp_dialog package.
// 7. The dialog displays a title and message, and it has a confirmation action that prints 'Confirmed!' to the console when the user confirms.
