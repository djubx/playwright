# Complete Example of tbib_downloader

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tbib_downloader/tbib_downloader.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to hold the download progress
  double _progress = 0.0;

  // Function to start the download
  void _startDownload() async {
    // URL of the file to download
    String url = 'https://example.com/file.pdf';
    // Destination path for the downloaded file
    String destination = '/storage/emulated/0/Download/file.pdf';

    // Start the download
    tbib_downloader.downloadFile(
      url: url,
      destination: destination,
      onReceiveProgress: (received, total) {
        // Update the progress variable
        setState(() {
          _progress = received / total;
        });
      },
    ).then((value) {
      // Show a success message when the download is complete
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Download completed!')),
      );
    }).catchError((error) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during the download
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Download failed: $error')),
      );
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('tbib_downloader Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Display the download progress
              LinearProgressIndicator(value: _progress),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Button to start the download
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _startDownload,
                child: Text('Download File'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatefulWidget that maintains the download progress.
// 3. When the user presses the "Download File" button, the _startDownload function is called.
// 4. This function initiates the file download using the tbib_downloader package.
// 5. The download progress is updated in real-time using the onReceiveProgress callback.
// 6. Once the download is complete, a success message is displayed; if it fails, an error message is shown.
```
