# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_exit_app

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_exit_app` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_exit_app` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_exit_app: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, you typically do not need to make any additional configurations. The package should work out of the box. However, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the correct permissions and configurations.

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to ensure that your app's Info.plist file is configured correctly. You might want to add any necessary permissions or configurations based on your app's requirements.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the exit functionality.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_exit_app/flutter_exit_app.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Exit App Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Call the exit app method
              FlutterExitApp.exitApp();
            },
            child: Text('Exit App'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, when the user presses the "Exit App" button, the application will exit gracefully.

# Complete Example of flutter_exit_app

Below is a complete example of a Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the `flutter_exit_app` package. The code includes detailed comments explaining each part of the application.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_exit_app/flutter_exit_app.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Exit App Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Call the exit app method when the button is pressed
              FlutterExitApp.exitApp();
            },
            child: Text('Exit App'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  // Run the RealFlutter application
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The runApp function initializes the app and displays the RealFlutter widget.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 4. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Flutter Exit App Example'.
// 5. In the body of the Scaffold, there is a Center widget that centers its child.
// 6. The child is an ElevatedButton that, when pressed, calls FlutterExitApp.exitApp().
// 7. This method triggers the exit process, closing the application gracefully.
```
