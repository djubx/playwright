# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Camera Android CameraX Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `camera_android_camerax` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `camera_android_camerax` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  camera_android_camerax: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
   ```

2. **Enable CameraX**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open your `Info.plist` file located in `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request camera permissions:

   ```xml
   <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your camera to take photos.</string>
   <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your photo library to save photos.</string>
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. Below is a complete example demonstrating how to implement camera functionalities.

# Complete Example: Implementing Camera Functionality

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:camera_android_camerax/camera_android_camerax.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  CameraController? _controller; // Controller for managing camera
  bool _isCameraInitialized = false; // Flag to check if camera is initialized

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _initializeCamera(); // Initialize the camera when the app starts
  }

  // Method to initialize the camera
  Future<void> _initializeCamera() async {
    // Get the available cameras
    final cameras = await availableCameras();
    // Select the first camera
    final camera = cameras.first;

    // Create a CameraController
    _controller = CameraController(
      camera,
      ResolutionPreset.high, // Set the resolution
    );

    // Initialize the controller
    await _controller!.initialize();
    setState(() {
      _isCameraInitialized = true; // Update the state to reflect camera initialization
    });
  }

  // Method to capture an image
  Future<void> _captureImage() async {
    if (_controller != null && _controller!.value.isInitialized) {
      try {
        // Capture the image
        final image = await _controller!.takePicture();
        // Display the captured image
        showDialog(
          context: context,
          builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
            title: Text('Captured Image'),
            content: Image.file(File(image.path)), // Display the image
            actions: [
              TextButton(
                onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                child: Text('Close'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        );
      } catch (e) {
        print('Error capturing image: $e'); // Handle any errors
      }
    }
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _controller?.dispose(); // Dispose of the controller when not in use
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Camera Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: _isCameraInitialized
              ? Column(
                  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
                  children: [
                    // Display the camera preview
                    AspectRatio(
                      aspectRatio: _controller!.value.aspectRatio,
                      child: CameraPreview(_controller!),
                    ),
                    SizedBox(height: 20),
                    ElevatedButton(
                      onPressed: _captureImage, // Capture image on button press
                      child: Text('Capture Image'),
                    ),
                  ],
                )
              : CircularProgressIndicator(), // Show loading indicator while initializing
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application that integrates the camera functionality using the camera_android_camerax package. 
// Here's a step-by-step explanation of the application flow:

// 1. **Main Function**: The app starts with the `main()` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` widget.
// 2. **Stateful Widget**: `RealFlutter` is a stateful widget that maintains the state of the camera controller and its initialization status.
// 3. **initState**: In the `initState()` method, the `_initializeCamera()` method is called to set up the camera when the widget is first created.
// 4. **Camera Initialization**: The `_initializeCamera()` method retrieves the available cameras, selects the first one, and initializes the `CameraController` with high resolution. Once initialized, it updates the state to reflect that the camera is ready.
// 5. **Capture Image**: The `_captureImage()` method captures an image when the button is pressed. It displays the captured image in a dialog.
// 6. **Dispose**: The `dispose()` method ensures that the camera controller is properly disposed of when the widget is removed from the widget tree.
// 7. **Build Method**: The `build()` method constructs the UI, showing a camera preview and a button to capture images. If the camera is not initialized, a loading indicator is displayed.
