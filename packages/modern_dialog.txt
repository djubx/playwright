# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Modern Dialog

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the `modern_dialog` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  modern_dialog: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, make sure to enable the necessary permissions in your `Info.plist` if your dialogs require any specific permissions (like camera or location).

## Step 4: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:modern_dialog/modern_dialog.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Dialog
You can now use the `modern_dialog` package to create and display dialogs. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to show a basic alert dialog:

```dart
ModernDialog.show(
  context: context,
  title: 'Alert',
  content: 'This is a modern alert dialog!',
  actions: [
    ModernDialogAction(
      label: 'OK',
      onPressed: () {
        Navigator.of(context).pop();
      },
    ),
  ],
);
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to create a simple alert dialog with an "OK" button that dismisses the dialog when pressed.

# Complete Example of Modern Dialog

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:modern_dialog/modern_dialog.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Modern Dialog Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Modern Dialog Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Show a modern dialog when the button is pressed
              ModernDialog.show(
                context: context,
                title: 'Welcome',
                content: 'This is a modern dialog example.',
                actions: [
                  ModernDialogAction(
                    label: 'Close',
                    onPressed: () {
                      // Close the dialog when the button is pressed
                      Navigator.of(context).pop();
                    },
                  ),
                ],
              );
            },
            child: Text('Show Dialog'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget with an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, it triggers the ModernDialog.show method.
// 5. The dialog displays a title and content, along with a Close button.
// 6. Pressing the Close button dismisses the dialog by calling Navigator.of(context).pop().
