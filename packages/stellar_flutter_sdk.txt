# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Stellar Flutter SDK

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **stellar_flutter_sdk** and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **stellar_flutter_sdk** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  stellar_flutter_sdk: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/stellar_flutter_sdk).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add internet permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following to allow network requests:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in our Flutter application.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

   ```dart
   import 'package:stellar_flutter_sdk/stellar_flutter_sdk.dart';
   ```

2. Initialize the Stellar SDK and create a new account:

   ```dart
   void createAccount() async {
       // Create a new key pair
       KeyPair keyPair = KeyPair.random();
       String publicKey = keyPair.accountId;
       String secretKey = keyPair.secret;

       // Create a new account on the Stellar network
       final server = StellarSDK.getTestNetServer();
       await server.accounts.createAccount(publicKey, secretKey);
       print('Account created: $publicKey');
   }
   ```

3. Send a payment:

   ```dart
   void sendPayment(String destination, String amount) async {
       final server = StellarSDK.getTestNetServer();
       final sourceKeyPair = KeyPair.fromSecret('YOUR_SECRET_KEY');

       // Create a transaction
       Transaction transaction = TransactionBuilder(
           sourceKeyPair: sourceKeyPair,
           network: Network.testnet,
       )
       .addOperation(
           PaymentOperationBuilder(destination, Asset.native(), amount).build(),
       )
       .build();

       // Sign the transaction
       transaction.sign(sourceKeyPair);

       // Submit the transaction
       try {
           final response = await server.submitTransaction(transaction);
           print('Payment successful: ${response.hash}');
       } catch (e) {
           print('Payment failed: $e');
       }
   }
   ```

This setup allows you to create accounts and send payments on the Stellar network using the **stellar_flutter_sdk**.

# Complete Example: Stellar Flutter SDK in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:stellar_flutter_sdk/stellar_flutter_sdk.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Stellar Flutter SDK Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Stellar SDK Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              createAccount();
            },
            child: Text('Create Account'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to create a new Stellar account
  void createAccount() async {
    // Generate a new key pair
    KeyPair keyPair = KeyPair.random();
    String publicKey = keyPair.accountId;
    String secretKey = keyPair.secret;

    // Initialize the Stellar test network server
    final server = StellarSDK.getTestNetServer();

    // Create a new account on the Stellar network
    await server.accounts.createAccount(publicKey, secretKey);
    print('Account created: $publicKey');

    // After account creation, you can send a payment
    sendPayment(publicKey, '10'); // Sending 10 lumens to the new account
  }

  // Function to send a payment to a specified destination
  void sendPayment(String destination, String amount) async {
    // Initialize the Stellar test network server
    final server = StellarSDK.getTestNetServer();
    final sourceKeyPair = KeyPair.fromSecret('YOUR_SECRET_KEY'); // Replace with your secret key

    // Create a transaction to send payment
    Transaction transaction = TransactionBuilder(
      sourceKeyPair: sourceKeyPair,
      network: Network.testnet,
    )
    .addOperation(
      PaymentOperationBuilder(destination, Asset.native(), amount).build(),
    )
    .build();

    // Sign the transaction with the source key pair
    transaction.sign(sourceKeyPair);

    // Submit the transaction to the Stellar network
    try {
      final response = await server.submitTransaction(transaction);
      print('Payment successful: ${response.hash}');
    } catch (e) {
      print('Payment failed: $e');
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and displays a button to create a Stellar account.
// 2. When the button is pressed, the createAccount function is called.
// 3. A new key pair is generated, and a new account is created on the Stellar test network.
// 4. After the account is created, the sendPayment function is called to send 10 lumens to the new account.
// 5. A transaction is built, signed, and submitted to the Stellar network.
// 6. The result of the payment transaction is printed to the console.
```
