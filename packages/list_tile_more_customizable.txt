## Setup Process

To get started with the `list_tile_more_customizable` package, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     list_tile_more_customizable: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
   ```

2. **Install the Package**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

     ```groovy
     android {
         ...
         defaultConfig {
             ...
             minSdkVersion 21
         }
     }
     ```

   - **iOS**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and ensure you have the necessary permissions if you are using images from the internet. Add the following key if needed:

     ```xml
     <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
     <dict>
         <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
         <true/>
     </dict>
     ```

## Using the Package

To use the `list_tile_more_customizable` package, you can create a simple list view in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:list_tile_more_customizable/list_tile_more_customizable.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Customizable List Tile Example'),
        ),
        body: ListView(
          children: [
            CustomListTile(
              title: 'Item 1',
              subtitle: 'This is the first item',
              leading: Icon(Icons.star),
              trailing: Icon(Icons.arrow_forward),
            ),
            CustomListTile(
              title: 'Item 2',
              subtitle: 'This is the second item',
              leading: Image.network('https://via.placeholder.com/150'),
              trailing: Icon(Icons.arrow_forward),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple list view with two customizable list tiles. The first tile includes an icon, while the second tile includes an image.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:list_tile_more_customizable/list_tile_more_customizable.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Customizable List Tile Example'), // Title of the app bar
        ),
        body: ListView(
          children: [
            // First customizable list tile
            CustomListTile(
              title: 'Item 1', // Title of the first item
              subtitle: 'This is the first item', // Subtitle of the first item
              leading: Icon(Icons.star), // Leading icon for the first item
              trailing: Icon(Icons.arrow_forward), // Trailing icon for the first item
            ),
            // Second customizable list tile
            CustomListTile(
              title: 'Item 2', // Title of the second item
              subtitle: 'This is the second item', // Subtitle of the second item
              leading: Image.network('https://via.placeholder.com/150'), // Leading image for the second item
              trailing: Icon(Icons.arrow_forward), // Trailing icon for the second item
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the `RealFlutter` class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The `MaterialApp` widget is created, providing the basic material design structure.
// 3. A `Scaffold` widget is used to create the app's layout, including an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The AppBar displays the title "Customizable List Tile Example".
// 5. The body contains a `ListView`, which allows for scrolling through a list of items.
// 6. Two `CustomListTile` widgets are added to the ListView, each with a title, subtitle, leading widget (icon or image), and trailing icon.
// 7. The first tile displays a star icon, while the second tile displays an image from the internet.
