# Pusher Client Flutter Package

The **Pusher Client** Flutter package is a powerful tool that allows developers to integrate real-time communication into their Flutter applications. It leverages the Pusher service, which provides a simple way to send and receive messages in real-time, making it ideal for applications that require instant updates, such as chat applications, live notifications, and collaborative tools.

## When to Use Pusher Client

You should consider using the Pusher Client package in scenarios such as:

- **Chat Applications**: To enable real-time messaging between users.
- **Live Notifications**: For applications that need to push updates to users instantly, like social media apps or news apps.
- **Collaborative Tools**: For applications that require real-time collaboration, such as document editing or project management tools.

## Features

- **Real-time Messaging**: Send and receive messages instantly.
- **Presence Channels**: Track users who are online and offline.
- **Event Broadcasting**: Broadcast events to multiple clients.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup and integration with Flutter applications.

The Pusher Client package is a robust solution for any Flutter developer looking to add real-time capabilities to their applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up Pusher Client in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the Pusher Client Flutter package and demonstrate how to use it in your application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the Pusher Client package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  pusher_client: ^0.1.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Configure for Android

For Android, you need to ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

## Step 3: Configure for iOS

For iOS, you need to enable the necessary capabilities. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Initialize Pusher Client

Now, you can initialize the Pusher Client in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

```dart
import 'package:pusher_client/pusher_client.dart';

class RealFlutter {
  late PusherClient pusher;

  void initPusher() {
    // Initialize Pusher Client with your app key and cluster
    pusher = PusherClient(
      'YOUR_APP_KEY',
      PusherOptions(cluster: 'YOUR_APP_CLUSTER'),
      autoConnect: true,
    );
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Subscribe to Channels

You can subscribe to channels and listen for events as follows:

```dart
void subscribeToChannel() {
  // Subscribe to a channel
  Channel channel = pusher.subscribe('my-channel');

  // Bind to an event
  channel.bind('my-event', (PusherEvent event) {
    print('Received event: ${event.data}');
  });
}
```

## Step 6: Trigger Events

To trigger events, you can use the Pusher REST API or any backend service that you have set up to send events to Pusher.

## Conclusion

You have now set up the Pusher Client in your Flutter application. You can subscribe to channels and listen for events, enabling real-time communication in your app.

# Complete Example of Pusher Client in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pusher_client/pusher_client.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late PusherClient pusher;
  late Channel channel;
  String message = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    initPusher(); // Initialize Pusher Client
    subscribeToChannel(); // Subscribe to a channel
  }

  void initPusher() {
    // Initialize Pusher Client with your app key and cluster
    pusher = PusherClient(
      'YOUR_APP_KEY',
      PusherOptions(cluster: 'YOUR_APP_CLUSTER'),
      autoConnect: true,
    );
  }

  void subscribeToChannel() {
    // Subscribe to a channel
    channel = pusher.subscribe('my-channel');

    // Bind to an event
    channel.bind('my-event', (PusherEvent event) {
      // Update the message state when an event is received
      setState(() {
        message = event.data; // Store the received message
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Pusher Client Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(
            message.isEmpty ? 'Waiting for messages...' : message,
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

```dart
// Explanation of the application flow:

// 1. The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` widget.
// 2. In the `RealFlutter` widget, the `initState` method is called, which initializes the Pusher client and subscribes to a channel.
// 3. The `initPusher` method sets up the Pusher client with the provided app key and cluster.
// 4. The `subscribeToChannel` method subscribes to 'my-channel' and binds to 'my-event'.
// 5. When an event is received, the `setState` method is called to update the UI with the new message.
// 6. The UI displays either a waiting message or the received message in the center of the screen.
```
