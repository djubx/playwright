# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Reflection Effect Package

## Installation
To use the `reflection_effect` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  reflection_effect: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if you are loading images from the network. You may need to add:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Using the Package
To use the `reflection_effect` package, you can wrap your image or widget with the `ReflectionEffect` widget. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:reflection_effect/reflection_effect.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Reflection Effect Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ReflectionEffect(
          child: Image.network(
            'https://example.com/image.jpg',
            height: 200,
            width: 200,
            fit: BoxFit.cover,
          ),
          reflectionHeight: 100, // Height of the reflection
          reflectionOpacity: 0.5, // Opacity of the reflection
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to create a reflection effect on an image. You can customize the `reflectionHeight` and `reflectionOpacity` properties to achieve the desired look.

# Complete Example of Using Reflection Effect

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:reflection_effect/reflection_effect.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Reflection Effect Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Reflection Effect Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ReflectionEffect(
            child: Image.network(
              'https://example.com/image.jpg', // Image URL
              height: 200, // Height of the image
              width: 200, // Width of the image
              fit: BoxFit.cover, // Fit the image within the bounds
            ),
            reflectionHeight: 100, // Set the height of the reflection
            reflectionOpacity: 0.5, // Set the opacity of the reflection
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, we use the ReflectionEffect widget.
// 5. The ReflectionEffect wraps an Image widget that loads an image from a URL.
// 6. The reflectionHeight and reflectionOpacity properties are set to customize the reflection's appearance.
// 7. The app displays the image with a reflection below it, creating a visually appealing effect.
