# Network Capture Flutter Package

The `network_capture` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that allows for the interception and logging of network requests and responses. This package is particularly useful for debugging and monitoring network activity in applications, making it easier to identify issues with API calls and data handling.

## When to Use

- **Debugging**: When you need to troubleshoot network issues in your Flutter application.
- **Monitoring**: To keep track of network requests and responses for analytics or performance monitoring.
- **Testing**: When writing tests that require verification of network interactions.

## Features

- **Interception of HTTP Requests**: Capture all outgoing HTTP requests made by the application.
- **Logging of Responses**: Log the responses received from the server, including status codes and response bodies.
- **Customizable Filters**: Apply filters to capture only specific requests or responses based on URL patterns or request methods.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup process that integrates seamlessly with existing Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Network Capture Package

## Installation

To get started with the `network_capture` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  network_capture: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/network_capture).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

### iOS

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to allow arbitrary loads (for development purposes):

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage

To start capturing network requests, you need to initialize the `NetworkCapture` class in your application. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:network_capture/network_capture.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Initialize the network capture
    NetworkCapture.init();

    return MaterialApp(
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}
```

In the above code, we initialize the `NetworkCapture` in the `main` function before running the app. This ensures that all network requests made by the app are captured.

# Complete Example of Using Network Capture

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:network_capture/network_capture.dart';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Initialize the network capture
    NetworkCapture.init();

    return MaterialApp(
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _response = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Start capturing network requests
    NetworkCapture.startCapture();
  }

  Future<void> _makeRequest() async {
    // Make a sample HTTP GET request
    final response = await http.get(Uri.parse('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1'));

    // Update the state with the response body
    setState(() {
      _response = response.body;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Network Capture Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _makeRequest,
              child: Text('Make Network Request'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text('Response: $_response'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Stop capturing network requests
    NetworkCapture.stopCapture();
    super.dispose();
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts by initializing the NetworkCapture in the main function.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which starts capturing network requests in its initState.
// 3. When the user presses the "Make Network Request" button, an HTTP GET request is made to a sample API.
// 4. The response from the API is displayed on the screen.
// 5. When the widget is disposed, network capturing is stopped to clean up resources.
