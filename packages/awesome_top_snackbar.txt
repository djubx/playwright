# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Awesome Top Snackbar

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **awesome_top_snackbar** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  awesome_top_snackbar: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that the package is set up, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to display a top snackbar.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:awesome_top_snackbar/awesome_top_snackbar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Awesome Top Snackbar Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Show the top snackbar when the button is pressed
            showTopSnackBar(
              context,
              CustomSnackBar.success(
                message: "This is a success message!",
              ),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Show Snackbar'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, a success snackbar will appear at the top of the screen.

# Complete Example of Awesome Top Snackbar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:awesome_top_snackbar/awesome_top_snackbar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Start the application with the main widget
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Awesome Top Snackbar Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(); // Set the home screen of the app
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home')), // App bar with title
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Show the top snackbar when the button is pressed
            showTopSnackBar(
              context,
              CustomSnackBar.success(
                message: "This is a success message!", // Message to display
              ),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Show Snackbar'), // Button text
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets HomeScreen as the home widget.
// 3. HomeScreen contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, there is an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the showTopSnackBar function is called.
// 6. This function displays a success snackbar at the top of the screen with the specified message.
// 7. The snackbar appears smoothly, providing feedback to the user without obstructing the main content.
