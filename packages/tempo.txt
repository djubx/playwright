# Tempo Flutter Package: A Comprehensive Overview

The **Tempo** package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who need to manage and manipulate time-based data efficiently. It provides a simple and intuitive API for handling various time-related functionalities, making it ideal for applications that require scheduling, timers, or any form of time management.

## When to Use Tempo
- **Scheduling Events**: If your application needs to schedule tasks or events, Tempo can help manage these efficiently.
- **Timers and Countdown**: For applications that require countdowns or timers, Tempo provides easy-to-use methods to implement these features.
- **Time Manipulation**: Tempo allows for easy manipulation of time data, making it suitable for applications that need to calculate durations or intervals.

## Key Features
- **Easy Time Manipulation**: Provides methods to add, subtract, and compare time intervals.
- **Event Scheduling**: Schedule events with specific time intervals and manage them effectively.
- **Timer Functionality**: Built-in support for creating timers and countdowns.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

With these features, Tempo stands out as a versatile package for any Flutter application that requires robust time management capabilities.

# Tempo Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the Tempo package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  tempo: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, make sure to enable the necessary permissions in your `Info.plist` if your application requires background processing for timers or scheduling.

## Basic Usage
Hereâ€™s how to use the Tempo package in your Flutter application:

1. **Import the Package**:
   At the top of your Dart file, import the Tempo package:

   ```dart
   import 'package:tempo/tempo.dart';
   ```

2. **Creating a Timer**:
   You can create a simple timer using the following code:

   ```dart
   void startTimer() {
       Timer(Duration(seconds: 10), () {
           print("Timer completed!");
       });
   }
   ```

3. **Scheduling an Event**:
   To schedule an event, you can use the `scheduleEvent` method:

   ```dart
   void scheduleMyEvent() {
       final eventTime = DateTime.now().add(Duration(hours: 1));
       Tempo.scheduleEvent(eventTime, () {
           print("Event triggered!");
       });
   }
   ```

With these steps, you can easily integrate the Tempo package into your Flutter application and start managing time effectively.

# Complete Example of Tempo Package in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tempo/tempo.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Tempo Example',
      home: TempoHome(),
    );
  }
}

class TempoHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _TempoHomeState createState() => _TempoHomeState();
}

class _TempoHomeState extends State<TempoHome> {
  String _timerMessage = "Timer not started";

  // Function to start a timer
  void startTimer() {
    // Start a timer for 10 seconds
    Timer(Duration(seconds: 10), () {
      // Update the state when the timer completes
      setState(() {
        _timerMessage = "Timer completed!";
      });
    });
  }

  // Function to schedule an event
  void scheduleMyEvent() {
    // Schedule an event for 1 hour from now
    final eventTime = DateTime.now().add(Duration(hours: 1));
    Tempo.scheduleEvent(eventTime, () {
      // This will be executed when the event time is reached
      print("Event triggered!");
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Tempo Package Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(_timerMessage), // Display the timer message
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: startTimer, // Start the timer when pressed
              child: Text('Start Timer'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: scheduleMyEvent, // Schedule an event when pressed
              child: Text('Schedule Event'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget (TempoHome).
// 3. TempoHome is a stateful widget that manages the timer message and event scheduling.
// 4. When the "Start Timer" button is pressed, the startTimer function is called.
// 5. This function sets a timer for 10 seconds, after which the message is updated.
// 6. When the "Schedule Event" button is pressed, the scheduleMyEvent function is called.
// 7. This function schedules an event to trigger in 1 hour, printing a message to the console.
// 8. The UI updates accordingly based on the timer's state and user interactions.
