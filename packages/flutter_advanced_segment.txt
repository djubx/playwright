# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_advanced_segment

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `flutter_advanced_segment` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_advanced_segment: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the segmented control, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_advanced_segment/flutter_advanced_segment.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

You can now use the `AdvancedSegment` widget in your Flutter application. Here’s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
AdvancedSegment(
  segments: ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3'],
  onValueChanged: (value) {
    // Handle the value change
    print('Selected: $value');
  },
)
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Customization

You can customize the appearance of the `AdvancedSegment` widget by using various properties such as `activeColor`, `inactiveColor`, and `borderRadius`. Here’s an example:

```dart
AdvancedSegment(
  segments: ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3'],
  onValueChanged: (value) {
    print('Selected: $value');
  },
  activeColor: Colors.blue,
  inactiveColor: Colors.grey,
  borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(10),
)
```

This customization allows you to match the segmented control with your app's theme and design.

# Complete Example of flutter_advanced_segment

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_advanced_segment/flutter_advanced_segment.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Advanced Segment Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to hold the selected segment value
  String selectedSegment = 'Option 1';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Advanced Segment Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // AdvancedSegment widget to allow users to select an option
            AdvancedSegment(
              segments: ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3'],
              onValueChanged: (value) {
                // Update the selected segment when the user changes the selection
                setState(() {
                  selectedSegment = value;
                });
              },
              activeColor: Colors.blue,
              inactiveColor: Colors.grey,
              borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(10),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Display the currently selected option
            Text(
              'Selected: $selectedSegment',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets MyApp as the home widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home screen.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the selected segment.
// 4. The build method of _RealFlutterState creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, an AdvancedSegment is created with three options.
// 6. When the user selects an option, the onValueChanged callback updates the selectedSegment state.
// 7. The currently selected option is displayed below the segmented control, updating in real-time as the user makes selections.
