# Setting Up the sunmi_printer Package

To get started with the `sunmi_printer` package, follow these steps:

## Installation

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `sunmi_printer` package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     sunmi_printer: ^latest_version
   ```

   Replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/sunmi_printer).

2. **Run Flutter Packages Get**: After saving the `pubspec.yaml` file, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
- Ensure that your Android project has the necessary permissions to access Bluetooth and network features. Add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS
- For iOS, you may need to configure your app's Info.plist to allow Bluetooth access. Add the following keys:

   ```xml
   <key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
   <string>This app requires Bluetooth access to connect to printers.</string>
   ```

## Using the Package

Once the package is installed and configured, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initialize the printer and print a receipt.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sunmi_printer/sunmi_printer.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  SunmiPrinter printer = SunmiPrinter();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the printer
    printer.connect();
  }

  void printReceipt() async {
    // Print a simple receipt
    await printer.printText("Receipt Title", styles: PosStyles(align: PosAlign.center, bold: true));
    await printer.printText("Item 1: \$10.00");
    await printer.printText("Item 2: \$15.00");
    await printer.printText("Total: \$25.00", styles: PosStyles(align: PosAlign.right));
    await printer.cutPaper();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Sunmi Printer Example")),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: printReceipt,
          child: Text("Print Receipt"),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code initializes the printer and provides a button to print a simple receipt when pressed.

# Complete Example of sunmi_printer in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sunmi_printer/sunmi_printer.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  SunmiPrinter printer = SunmiPrinter();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the printer connection
    printer.connect();
  }

  void printReceipt() async {
    // Start printing the receipt
    await printer.printText("Receipt Title", styles: PosStyles(align: PosAlign.center, bold: true));
    // Print items with their prices
    await printer.printText("Item 1: \$10.00");
    await printer.printText("Item 2: \$15.00");
    // Print the total amount
    await printer.printText("Total: \$25.00", styles: PosStyles(align: PosAlign.right));
    // Cut the paper after printing
    await printer.cutPaper();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Sunmi Printer Example")),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: printReceipt, // Call printReceipt when button is pressed
          child: Text("Print Receipt"),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the initState method, the printer connection is established.
// 3. The build method creates a simple UI with a button.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the printReceipt method is called.
// 5. The printReceipt method sends commands to the printer to print the receipt.
// 6. It prints the title, items, and total amount, and finally cuts the paper.
