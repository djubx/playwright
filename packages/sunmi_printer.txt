// This is the main entry point of the app.
// The MyApp widget is the root of the app.
// The MyHomePage widget is the home page of the app.
// The _MyHomePageState class is the state of the MyHomePage widget.
// The SunmiPrinter object is created and connected to the printer in the initState method.
// The printText, printImage, and printBarcode methods are called when the corresponding buttons are pressed.

// The app uses the SunmiPrinter package to print text, images, and barcodes.
// The package is initialized and connected to the printer in the initState method.
// The print methods are called when the corresponding buttons are pressed.

// This is a basic example of how to use the SunmiPrinter package in a Flutter app.
// You can customize the app to suit your needs and add more features as required.
