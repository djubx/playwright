# Setting Up flutter_animated_icon_button

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To use the `flutter_animated_icon_button` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_animated_icon_button: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install the Package

Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_animated_icon_button/flutter_animated_icon_button.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Animated Icon Button

You can now use the `AnimatedIconButton` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
AnimatedIconButton(
  icons: [
    Icon(Icons.favorite_border),
    Icon(Icons.favorite),
  ],
  onPressed: () {
    // Handle button press
  },
  duration: Duration(milliseconds: 300),
  size: 50.0,
  color: Colors.red,
);
```

This code snippet creates an animated button that toggles between a heart outline and a filled heart when pressed.

With these steps, you are now ready to use the `flutter_animated_icon_button` package in your Flutter applications!

<!-- START_MAIN -->
# Complete Example of flutter_animated_icon_button

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_animated_icon_button/flutter_animated_icon_button.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animated Icon Button Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Animated Icon Button Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: AnimatedIconButtonExample(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class AnimatedIconButtonExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _AnimatedIconButtonExampleState createState() => _AnimatedIconButtonExampleState();
}

class _AnimatedIconButtonExampleState extends State<AnimatedIconButtonExample> {
  // State variable to track the button's state
  bool _isFavorite = false;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return AnimatedIconButton(
      icons: [
        Icon(Icons.favorite_border), // Icon when not favorite
        Icon(Icons.favorite), // Icon when favorite
      ],
      onPressed: () {
        // Toggle the favorite state
        setState(() {
          _isFavorite = !_isFavorite; // Update the state
        });
      },
      duration: Duration(milliseconds: 300), // Animation duration
      size: 100.0, // Size of the button
      color: Colors.red, // Color of the icons
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp and Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds the AnimatedIconButtonExample.
// 4. AnimatedIconButtonExample is a StatefulWidget that manages the state of the button.
// 5. The _isFavorite boolean variable tracks whether the button is in the favorite state.
// 6. When the button is pressed, the onPressed callback toggles the _isFavorite state and rebuilds the widget.
// 7. The AnimatedIconButton displays different icons based on the _isFavorite state, providing visual feedback to the user.
