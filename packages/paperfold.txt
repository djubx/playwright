# Setting Up the Paperfold Package

To get started with the paperfold package, follow these steps:

## Installation
1. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file.
2. Add the paperfold package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     paperfold: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
   ```

3. Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
- Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS
- No specific configurations are required for iOS, but ensure you have the latest version of Xcode for compatibility.

## Basic Usage
To use the paperfold package, you need to wrap your widget with the `PaperFold` widget provided by the package. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:paperfold/paperfold.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Paperfold Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: PaperFold(
            child: Container(
              width: 200,
              height: 200,
              color: Colors.blue,
              child: Center(child: Text('Fold Me!', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white))),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code creates a simple application with a foldable blue box that says "Fold Me!" in the center. You can customize the `PaperFold` widget to adjust the folding effects as needed.

With these steps, you are now ready to implement the paperfold package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of the Paperfold Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:paperfold/paperfold.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Paperfold Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Paperfold Animation'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          // Wrapping the Container with PaperFold to enable folding effect
          child: PaperFold(
            // Setting the folding angle and duration
            foldAngle: 0.5, // Adjust the angle of the fold
            duration: Duration(milliseconds: 300), // Duration of the animation
            child: Container(
              width: 300, // Width of the foldable container
              height: 300, // Height of the foldable container
              color: Colors.blue, // Background color of the container
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'Tap to Fold',
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Paperfold Animation'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers a PaperFold widget.
// 5. The PaperFold widget wraps a Container that has a blue background and a text 'Tap to Fold'.
// 6. The foldAngle and duration properties of PaperFold control the folding effect.
// 7. When the user taps on the container, the folding animation is triggered, creating an engaging visual effect.
