// The app starts by importing the necessary packages and creating a new instance of the InstaPublicApi class.
// Then, it fetches the user's profile information and media using the getUser and getMedia methods.
// Next, it fetches the latest stories posted by the user using the getStories method.
// After that, it creates a new Flutter app with the fetched data using the RealFlutterApp class.
// The RealFlutterApp class creates a new MaterialApp with a Scaffold and an AppBar.
// The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget with a Column widget.
// The Column widget contains three Text widgets that display the user's username, the number of media posted, and the number of stories posted.
// Finally, the app runs the RealFlutterApp using the runApp function.
