# Overview of the jfullinfo Flutter Package

The **jfullinfo** package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who need to access detailed information about the device and its environment. This package provides a comprehensive set of features that allow developers to retrieve various system information, such as device model, operating system version, battery status, and more. 

## When to Use jfullinfo

You might consider using the jfullinfo package in scenarios such as:
- Building applications that require device-specific optimizations.
- Creating analytics tools that track device information.
- Developing apps that need to display system information to users.

## Key Features
- **Device Information**: Retrieve details about the device model, manufacturer, and OS version.
- **Battery Status**: Access real-time battery information, including level and charging status.
- **Network Information**: Get details about the current network connection type and status.
- **User-Friendly API**: Simple and intuitive API for easy integration into your Flutter applications.

Overall, jfullinfo is an essential package for developers looking to enhance their applications with device-specific information.

# Setting Up and Using jfullinfo

## Installation

To add the jfullinfo package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  jfullinfo: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/jfullinfo).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to access device information. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BATTERY_STATS"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add specific keys to your `Info.plist` file to request permission for accessing certain device features. However, jfullinfo typically does not require additional permissions for basic functionality.

## Using jfullinfo

To use the jfullinfo package, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:jfullinfo/jfullinfo.dart';
```

You can then create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class and call its methods to retrieve device information.

```dart
void main() async {
  // Initialize the package
  await RealFlutter.initialize();

  // Fetch device information
  var deviceInfo = await RealFlutter.getDeviceInfo();
  print(deviceInfo);
}
```

This setup will allow you to access various device details and utilize them in your application.

# Complete Example of jfullinfo in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:jfullinfo/jfullinfo.dart';

void main() async {
  // Ensure that Flutter is initialized before running the app
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  
  // Initialize the jfullinfo package
  await RealFlutter.initialize();
  
  // Run the Flutter application
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'jfullinfo Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  String deviceInfo = "Fetching device info...";

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Fetch device information when the screen initializes
    _fetchDeviceInfo();
  }

  Future<void> _fetchDeviceInfo() async {
    // Get device information using jfullinfo
    var info = await RealFlutter.getDeviceInfo();
    
    // Update the state with the fetched information
    setState(() {
      deviceInfo = info.toString();
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Device Information'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          deviceInfo, // Display the device information
          textAlign: TextAlign.center,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter framework and the jfullinfo package.
// 2. The MyApp widget is created, which sets up the MaterialApp and HomeScreen.
// 3. In HomeScreen, the _fetchDeviceInfo method is called during initState to retrieve device information.
// 4. The device information is fetched asynchronously and stored in the deviceInfo variable.
// 5. The UI is updated to display the fetched device information on the screen.
