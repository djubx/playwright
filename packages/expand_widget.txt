# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Expand Widget Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `expand_widget` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  expand_widget: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Expand Widget

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement an expandable widget.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:expand_widget/expand_widget.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Expand Widget Example'),
        ),
        body: ListView(
          children: [
            ExpandablePanel(
              header: Text('Header 1'),
              expanded: Text('This is the expanded content for header 1.'),
            ),
            ExpandablePanel(
              header: Text('Header 2'),
              expanded: Text('This is the expanded content for header 2.'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple app with two expandable panels. Each panel has a header and an expanded section that reveals more content when tapped.

# Complete Example of Expand Widget

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:expand_widget/expand_widget.dart';

// Main class of the Flutter application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Expand Widget Example'), // Title of the app
        ),
        body: ListView(
          children: [
            // First expandable panel
            ExpandablePanel(
              header: Text('Header 1'), // Header of the panel
              expanded: Text('This is the expanded content for header 1.'), // Content shown when expanded
            ),
            // Second expandable panel
            ExpandablePanel(
              header: Text('Header 2'), // Header of the panel
              expanded: Text('This is the expanded content for header 2.'), // Content shown when expanded
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a ListView.
3. The ListView contains two ExpandablePanel widgets.
4. Each ExpandablePanel has a header and an expanded section.
5. When a user taps on a header, the corresponding expanded content is revealed with a smooth animation.
6. This allows users to view additional information without navigating away from the main screen, enhancing the user experience.

In summary, the `expand_widget` package provides a simple yet effective way to create expandable and collapsible widgets in Flutter applications. The example above demonstrates how to set up the package, create expandable panels, and explains the flow of the application step-by-step. This package is a great addition to any Flutter developer's toolkit, allowing for cleaner and more interactive user interfaces.
