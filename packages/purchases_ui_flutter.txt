# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `purchases_ui_flutter`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `purchases_ui_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  purchases_ui_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/purchases_ui_flutter).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update `AndroidManifest.xml`**: Add the necessary permissions and metadata in your `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file:

   ```xml
   <manifest>
       <application>
           <meta-data
               android:name="com.revenuecat.purchases.apiKey"
               android:value="YOUR_REVENUECAT_API_KEY" />
       </application>
   </manifest>
   ```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure your `android/build.gradle` file includes the Google services classpath:

   ```groovy
   buildscript {
       dependencies {
           classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.10' // Check for the latest version
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update `Info.plist`**: Add the following keys to your `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   <key>REVENUECAT_API_KEY</key>
   <string>YOUR_REVENUECAT_API_KEY</string>
   ```

2. **CocoaPods**: Ensure you have the latest version of CocoaPods installed and run:

   ```bash
   cd ios
   pod install
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the purchasing UI.

# Complete Example of Using `purchases_ui_flutter`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:purchases_ui_flutter/purchases_ui_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Purchases UI Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: PurchaseScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PurchaseScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PurchaseScreenState createState() => _PurchaseScreenState();
}

class _PurchaseScreenState extends State<PurchaseScreen> {
  // This will hold the available products for purchase
  List<Product> _products = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Fetch available products when the screen initializes
    _fetchProducts();
  }

  // Function to fetch products from the RevenueCat backend
  Future<void> _fetchProducts() async {
    try {
      // Fetch products and update the state
      final products = await Purchases.getProducts(['product_id_1', 'product_id_2']);
      setState(() {
        _products = products;
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during product fetching
      print('Error fetching products: $e');
    }
  }

  // Function to handle purchase
  Future<void> _purchaseProduct(Product product) async {
    try {
      // Initiate the purchase process
      await Purchases.purchaseProduct(product.identifier);
      // Show success message
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(SnackBar(content: Text('Purchase successful!')));
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during the purchase
      print('Error purchasing product: $e');
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(SnackBar(content: Text('Purchase failed!')));
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('In-App Purchases'),
      ),
      body: _products.isEmpty
          ? Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator()) // Show loading indicator while fetching products
          : ListView.builder(
              itemCount: _products.length,
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                final product = _products[index];
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text(product.title), // Display product title
                  subtitle: Text(product.description), // Display product description
                  trailing: Text('\$${product.price}'), // Display product price
                  onTap: () => _purchaseProduct(product), // Handle product tap
                );
              },
            ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home screen as PurchaseScreen.
// 3. In PurchaseScreen, the _fetchProducts method is called during initialization to retrieve available products from RevenueCat.
// 4. The products are displayed in a ListView, where each product can be tapped to initiate a purchase.
// 5. When a product is tapped, the _purchaseProduct method is called, which handles the purchase process and displays a success or failure message.
```
