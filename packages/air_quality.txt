# Tutorial: Setting Up the Air Quality Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **air_quality** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **air_quality** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  air_quality: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open the `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open the `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following key to request permission for location access (if needed):

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your location to provide air quality data.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to fetch and display air quality data.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:air_quality/air_quality.dart';
```

2. Create a method to fetch air quality data:

```dart
Future<void> fetchAirQuality() async {
  // Create an instance of the AirQuality class
  final airQuality = AirQuality();

  // Fetch air quality data for a specific location
  final data = await airQuality.getAirQualityByCity('Los Angeles');

  // Handle the data (e.g., display it in the UI)
  print(data);
}
```

3. Call this method in your widget's lifecycle (e.g., in `initState`).

With these steps, you can successfully integrate the **air_quality** package into your Flutter application and start retrieving air quality data.

# Complete Example of Using the Air Quality Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:air_quality/air_quality.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _airQualityData = 'Fetching air quality data...'; // Placeholder for air quality data

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    fetchAirQuality(); // Fetch air quality data when the app starts
  }

  Future<void> fetchAirQuality() async {
    // Create an instance of the AirQuality class
    final airQuality = AirQuality();

    // Fetch air quality data for a specific location
    final data = await airQuality.getAirQualityByCity('Los Angeles');

    // Update the state with the fetched data
    setState(() {
      _airQualityData = data.toString(); // Convert data to string for display
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Air Quality App',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Air Quality in Los Angeles'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(_airQualityData), // Display the air quality data
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts by running the main() function, which initializes the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget, the initState() method is called, which triggers the fetchAirQuality() method.
// 3. The fetchAirQuality() method creates an instance of the AirQuality class and fetches air quality data for Los Angeles.
// 4. Once the data is retrieved, the state is updated using setState(), which causes the UI to rebuild with the new air quality data.
// 5. The air quality data is displayed in the center of the screen.
```
