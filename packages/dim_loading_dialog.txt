# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Dim Loading Dialog

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the **dim_loading_dialog** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dim_loading_dialog: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:dim_loading_dialog/dim_loading_dialog.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Loading Dialog
You can use the loading dialog in your application by calling the `showDimLoadingDialog` method. Here’s how to do it:

### For Android
Ensure that your Android project is set up to support the required minimum SDK version. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and set the `minSdkVersion` to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### For iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0. Open `ios/Podfile` and set the platform:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Example Usage
Here’s a simple example of how to use the loading dialog in a button click event:

```dart
void _performTask() async {
  // Show the loading dialog
  showDimLoadingDialog(context, message: "Loading...");

  // Simulate a network request or a long-running task
  await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3));

  // Dismiss the loading dialog
  Navigator.of(context).pop();
}
```

In this example, when the `_performTask` method is called, the loading dialog appears, simulating a task for 3 seconds before dismissing it.

# Complete Example of Dim Loading Dialog

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dim_loading_dialog/dim_loading_dialog.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dim Loading Dialog Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Dim Loading Dialog Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _performTask, // Call the task on button press
          child: Text('Start Task'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void _performTask() async {
    // Show the loading dialog with a custom message
    showDimLoadingDialog(context, message: "Loading...");

    // Simulate a network request or a long-running task
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3));

    // Dismiss the loading dialog
    Navigator.of(context).pop();
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget contains a button that, when pressed, calls the _performTask method.
// 4. Inside _performTask, the loading dialog is shown with a message indicating that a task is in progress.
// 5. The app simulates a delay of 3 seconds to represent a long-running task.
// 6. After the delay, the loading dialog is dismissed, returning the user to the home screen.
```
