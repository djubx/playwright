# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Multilevel Drawer Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **multilevel_drawer** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  multilevel_drawer: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/multilevel_drawer).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    compileSdkVersion 31 // or latest
    ...
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0' # or latest
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:multilevel_drawer/multilevel_drawer.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Multilevel Drawer

You can now use the `MultilevelDrawer` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:multilevel_drawer/multilevel_drawer.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Multilevel Drawer Example')),
        body: Center(child: Text('Home Page')),
        drawer: MultilevelDrawer(
          children: [
            // Define your drawer items here
            MultilevelDrawerItem(
              leading: Icon(Icons.home),
              title: 'Home',
              onTap: () {
                // Handle Home tap
              },
            ),
            MultilevelDrawerItem(
              leading: Icon(Icons.settings),
              title: 'Settings',
              children: [
                MultilevelDrawerItem(
                  leading: Icon(Icons.account_circle),
                  title: 'Profile',
                  onTap: () {
                    // Handle Profile tap
                  },
                ),
                MultilevelDrawerItem(
                  leading: Icon(Icons.security),
                  title: 'Security',
                  onTap: () {
                    // Handle Security tap
                  },
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic multilevel drawer with two main items: Home and Settings. The Settings item has two sub-items: Profile and Security.

          children: [
            // First item in the drawer
            MultilevelDrawerItem(
              leading: Icon(Icons.home), // Icon for Home
              title: 'Home', // Title for Home

              },
            ),
            // Second item in the drawer with sub-items
            MultilevelDrawerItem(
              leading: Icon(Icons.settings), // Icon for Settings
              title: 'Settings', // Title for Settings
              children: [
                // Sub-item for Profile
                MultilevelDrawerItem(
                  leading: Icon(Icons.account_circle), // Icon for Profile
                  title: 'Profile', // Title for Profile
                  onTap: () {
                    // Action when Profile is tapped
                    Navigator.pop(context); // Close the drawer
                    // Navigate to Profile page (not implemented here)
                  },
                ),
                // Sub-item for Security
                MultilevelDrawerItem(
                  leading: Icon(Icons.security), // Icon for Security
                  title: 'Security', // Title for Security
                  onTap: () {
                    // Action when Security is tapped
                    Navigator.pop(context); // Close the drawer
                    // Navigate to Security page (not implemented here)
                  },
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The MaterialApp widget is created, providing the app structure.
// 3. A Scaffold widget is used to create the basic visual layout.
// 4. An AppBar is added with the title 'Multilevel Drawer Example'.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget displaying 'Home Page'.
// 6. The drawer is implemented using the MultilevelDrawer widget.
// 7. The drawer contains two main items: Home and Settings.
// 8. The Home item has an onTap function that closes the drawer when tapped.
// 9. The Settings item has two sub-items: Profile and Security, each with their own onTap functions.
// 10. Tapping on any item closes the drawer and can navigate to other pages (not implemented in this example).
