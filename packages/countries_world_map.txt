# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Countries World Map Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `countries_world_map` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  countries_world_map: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/countries_world_map).

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you plan to access location services or other features. Here’s an example of adding location permissions:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your location.</string>
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:countries_world_map/countries_world_map.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package

You can now use the `CountriesWorldMap` widget in your application. Here’s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
CountriesWorldMap(
  onCountryTap: (country) {
    // Handle country tap
    print('Tapped on: $country');
  },
  // Additional customization options
)
```

This widget allows you to specify a callback function that will be triggered when a user taps on a country.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and start using the `countries_world_map` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using the Countries World Map Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:countries_world_map/countries_world_map.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Countries World Map Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('World Map'),
        ),
        body: CountriesWorldMap(
          onCountryTap: (country) {
            // This function is called when a country is tapped
            // Displaying the tapped country name in a snackbar
            ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
              SnackBar(content: Text('Tapped on: $country')),
            );
          },
          // Customizing the map's appearance
          borderColor: Colors.black,
          borderWidth: 1.0,
          countryColor: Colors.blueAccent,
          selectedCountryColor: Colors.redAccent,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'World Map'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold includes the CountriesWorldMap widget.
// 5. The onCountryTap callback is defined to show a snackbar with the name of the tapped country.
// 6. The map's appearance is customized with border color, border width, and country colors.
// 7. When a user taps on a country, the snackbar displays the name of the country, providing immediate feedback.
