### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

To use `flutter_playout`, add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml

  flutter_playout: ^1.1.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

Import the `flutter_playout` package in your Dart file:

```

### Step 3: Create a Playout Player

Create a `Playout` player instance and pass the media URL or file path:

```dart
Playout player = Playout(
  url: 'https://example.com/video.mp4',
  // or
  // file: File('path/to/local/video.mp4'),
);
```

### Step 4: Customize the Player (Optional)

You can customize the player's appearance by passing various options:

```dart
Playout player = Playout(
  url: 'https://example.com/video.mp4',
  controls: true,
  autoplay: true,
  loop: true,
  aspectRatio: 16 / 9,
);
```

*   **Android:** Make sure to add the `android.permission.INTERNET` permission to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file.
*   **iOS:** Add the `NSAppTransportSecurity` key to your `Info.plist` file to allow HTTP requests.

    // Initialize the player with a media URL
    _player = Playout(
      url: 'https://example.com/video.mp4',
      controls: true,
      autoplay: true,
      loop: true,
      aspectRatio: 16 / 9,
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Playout Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display the Playout player
            _player,
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application flow:
// 1. The app starts and initializes the Playout player with a media URL.
// 2. The player is displayed on the screen with controls and autoplay enabled.
// 3. The user can interact with the player controls to play, pause, seek, and adjust volume.
// 4. The player loops the video playback continuously.
// 5. The app maintains a clean and simple UI, focusing on the media playback experience.
