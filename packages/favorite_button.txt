# Tutorial: Setting Up the Favorite Button Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **favorite_button** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **favorite_button** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  favorite_button: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Import the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the favorite button, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:favorite_button/favorite_button.dart';
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Favorite Button

You can now use the favorite button in your widget tree. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
FavoriteButton(
  isFavorite: false, // Initial state
  iconSize: 40.0, // Size of the icon
  valueChanged: (_isFavorite) {
    // This callback is called when the button is pressed
    print('Is Favorite: $_isFavorite');
  },
),
```

This button will toggle its state when pressed, and the `valueChanged` callback will provide the current state of the button.

# Complete Example of Favorite Button

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:favorite_button/favorite_button.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Favorite Button Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Favorite Button Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: FavoriteButton(
            isFavorite: false, // Initial state of the button
            iconSize: 40.0, // Size of the favorite icon
            valueChanged: (_isFavorite) {
              // This callback is triggered when the button is pressed
              print('Is Favorite: $_isFavorite');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Favorite Button Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a FavoriteButton widget.
// 5. The FavoriteButton is initialized with an initial state of 'false', meaning it is not a favorite yet.
// 6. When the button is pressed, the valueChanged callback is triggered, printing the current favorite state to the console.
// 7. The icon size of the button is set to 40.0, making it visually appealing and easy to interact with.
```

// Final Summary:
// The application starts with the main function, which initializes the Flutter app. The RealFlutter widget sets up a simple UI with an AppBar and a centered FavoriteButton. The button's initial state is set to false, indicating it is not a favorite. When the user taps the button, it toggles its state and prints the current state to the console, demonstrating how the favorite functionality works seamlessly within the app.
