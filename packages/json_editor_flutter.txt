# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using json_editor_flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `json_editor_flutter` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `json_editor_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  json_editor_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/json_editor_flutter).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file, depending on your app's requirements. However, for basic usage of the `json_editor_flutter` package, no specific configurations are required.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the JSON editor in your app.

<!-- END_TUTORIAL -->

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:json_editor/json_editor.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // The main widget of the application
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'JSON Editor Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: JsonEditorScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class JsonEditorScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _JsonEditorScreenState createState() => _JsonEditorScreenState();
}

class _JsonEditorScreenState extends State<JsonEditorScreen> {
  // Sample JSON data to be edited
  final Map<String, dynamic> _jsonData = {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 30,
    "isDeveloper": true,
    "skills": ["Flutter", "Dart", "JavaScript"]
  };

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Building the JSON editor widget
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('JSON Editor'),
      ),
      body: JsonEditor(
        // Providing the JSON data to the editor
        json: _jsonData,
        // Callback for when the JSON is edited
        onChange: (value) {
          setState(() {
            // Updating the state with the new JSON data
            _jsonData.clear();
            _jsonData.addAll(value);
          });
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home of the app is set to JsonEditorScreen.
// 4. In JsonEditorScreen, we define a sample JSON data structure.
// 5. The JsonEditor widget is created, displaying the JSON data.
// 6. When the user edits the JSON, the onChange callback updates the state with the new data.
```
<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application that utilizes the `json_editor_flutter` package to display and edit JSON data. The application flow is straightforward:

1. The `main` function initializes the `RealFlutter` app.
2. The `RealFlutter` widget sets up the `MaterialApp` with a title and theme.
3. The home screen is defined as `JsonEditorScreen`, where we initialize a sample JSON object.
4. The `JsonEditor` widget is used to display and edit the JSON data.
5. The `onChange` callback updates the state whenever the JSON is modified, ensuring that the UI reflects the latest changes.

This setup provides a solid foundation for any Flutter application that requires JSON editing capabilities, making it easy for users to interact with and modify JSON data dynamically.
