<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Design Tokens Builder Flutter Package

The `design_tokens_builder` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to streamline the management of design tokens in Flutter applications. Design tokens are a way to store design decisions such as colors, typography, spacing, and other UI elements in a centralized manner. This package allows developers to define, manage, and utilize these tokens effectively, ensuring consistency across the application.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `design_tokens_builder` package when:
- You want to maintain a consistent design language across your Flutter application.
- You are working in a team where design decisions need to be shared and reused.
- You need to easily update design elements without having to search through multiple files.

## Features

- **Centralized Management**: Store all design tokens in one place, making it easy to manage and update.
- **Type Safety**: Leverage Dart's type system to ensure that design tokens are used correctly throughout the application.
- **Customizable**: Easily extend the package to fit your specific design needs.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

By using the `design_tokens_builder`, developers can enhance their workflow, reduce redundancy, and improve the maintainability of their codebase.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Design Tokens Builder

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `design_tokens_builder` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `design_tokens_builder` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  design_tokens_builder: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, make sure your `ios/Podfile` is set to use the latest platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '12.0' # or higher
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. Below is an example of how to define and use design tokens.

1. **Define Design Tokens**: Create a new Dart file (e.g., `design_tokens.dart`) to define your design tokens.

```dart
import 'package:design_tokens_builder/design_tokens_builder.dart';

class DesignTokens {
  static final Color primaryColor = Color(0xFF6200EE);
  static final Color secondaryColor = Color(0xFF03DAC6);
  static final double spacingSmall = 8.0;
  static final double spacingMedium = 16.0;
  static final double spacingLarge = 32.0;
}
```

2. **Use Design Tokens in Your Widgets**: You can now use these tokens in your Flutter widgets.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'design_tokens.dart';

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Design Tokens Example'),
          backgroundColor: DesignTokens.primaryColor,
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: EdgeInsets.all(DesignTokens.spacingMedium),
          child: Center(
            child: Text(
              'Hello, Design Tokens!',
              style: TextStyle(
                color: DesignTokens.secondaryColor,
                fontSize: 24,
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. **Run Your Application**: Use the following command to run your application:

```bash
flutter run
```

This will launch your Flutter application, and you should see the design tokens applied in the UI.

# Complete Example: Main File

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'design_tokens.dart'; // Importing the design tokens

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp()); // Starting the Flutter application
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Design Tokens Example'), // Title of the app
          backgroundColor: DesignTokens.primaryColor, // Using primary color token
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: EdgeInsets.all(DesignTokens.spacingMedium), // Using spacing token
          child: Center(
            child: Text(
              'Hello, Design Tokens!', // Displaying text
              style: TextStyle(
                color: DesignTokens.secondaryColor, // Using secondary color token
                fontSize: 24, // Font size
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The MyApp class is a StatelessWidget that builds the main UI.
// 3. The MaterialApp widget is used to create a material design application.
// 4. The Scaffold widget provides a structure for the app, including an AppBar and body.
// 5. The AppBar displays the title and uses the primary color defined in the design tokens.
// 6. The body contains a Padding widget that applies spacing around the content.
// 7. Inside the Padding, a Center widget is used to center the text.
// 8. The Text widget displays a message and uses the secondary color from the design tokens.
