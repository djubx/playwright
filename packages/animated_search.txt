# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Animated Search

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the `animated_search` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  animated_search: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/animated_search).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:animated_search/animated_search.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Animated Search Widget
You can now use the `AnimatedSearch` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
AnimatedSearch(
  onSearch: (String query) {
    // Handle the search query
  },
  hintText: 'Search...',
  // Additional customization options
)
```

This widget will handle the animation and display the search bar when needed.

## Step 5: Customization
You can customize the appearance of the search bar by providing additional parameters such as `backgroundColor`, `textColor`, and `borderRadius`.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the `animated_search` package into your Flutter application seamlessly.

# Complete Example of Animated Search

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_search/animated_search.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animated Search Example',
      home: SearchPage(),
    );
  }
}

class SearchPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SearchPageState createState() => _SearchPageState();
}

class _SearchPageState extends State<SearchPage> {
  // This list will hold the data to be searched
  final List<String> items = [
    'Apple',
    'Banana',
    'Cherry',
    'Date',
    'Elderberry',
    'Fig',
    'Grape',
  ];

  // This list will hold the filtered results
  List<String> filteredItems = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initially, the filtered items are the same as the original items
    filteredItems = items;
  }

  // This method will be called when the user performs a search
  void _onSearch(String query) {
    // Filter the items based on the search query
    setState(() {
      filteredItems = items
          .where((item) => item.toLowerCase().contains(query.toLowerCase()))
          .toList();
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Animated Search Example'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Animated search bar
          AnimatedSearch(
            onSearch: _onSearch, // Call the search method
            hintText: 'Search fruits...',
          ),
          // Display the filtered results
          Expanded(
            child: ListView.builder(
              itemCount: filteredItems.length,
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text(filteredItems[index]),
                );
              },
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The SearchPage widget is created, which contains the search functionality.
// 3. In the _SearchPageState, we initialize a list of items and a filtered list.
// 4. The _onSearch method filters the items based on the user's input.
// 5. The AnimatedSearch widget is displayed at the top, allowing users to input their search query.
// 6. As the user types, the filtered results are updated and displayed in a ListView below the search bar.
