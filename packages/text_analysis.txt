# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the text_analysis Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started with the `text_analysis` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  text_analysis: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package
In your Dart files, import the package to start using it:

```dart
import 'package:text_analysis/text_analysis.dart';
```

## Step 5: Basic Usage
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the `text_analysis` package to perform sentiment analysis:

```dart
void main() {
  String text = "I love Flutter! It's an amazing framework.";
  var sentiment = TextAnalysis.analyzeSentiment(text);
  print("Sentiment: ${sentiment}");
}
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to analyze the sentiment of a given text string. The `analyzeSentiment` method returns the sentiment score, which can be positive, negative, or neutral.

With these steps, you are now ready to integrate the `text_analysis` package into your Flutter application and leverage its powerful text processing capabilities.

# Complete Example of Using the text_analysis Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:text_analysis/text_analysis.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Text Analysis Example',
      home: TextAnalysisHome(),
    );
  }
}

class TextAnalysisHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _TextAnalysisHomeState createState() => _TextAnalysisHomeState();
}

class _TextAnalysisHomeState extends State<TextAnalysisHome> {
  String _inputText = '';
  String _sentimentResult = '';
  String _keywordsResult = '';

  // Function to analyze text
  void _analyzeText() {
    // Perform sentiment analysis
    var sentiment = TextAnalysis.analyzeSentiment(_inputText);
    setState(() {
      _sentimentResult = "Sentiment: ${sentiment}";
    });

    // Perform keyword extraction
    var keywords = TextAnalysis.extractKeywords(_inputText);
    setState(() {
      _keywordsResult = "Keywords: ${keywords.join(', ')}";
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Text Analysis Example'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              onChanged: (text) {
                _inputText = text; // Update input text
              },
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Enter text for analysis',
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _analyzeText, // Trigger analysis
              child: Text('Analyze Text'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(_sentimentResult), // Display sentiment result
            SizedBox(height: 10),
            Text(_keywordsResult), // Display keywords result
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp and points to the TextAnalysisHome widget.
// 3. TextAnalysisHome is a stateful widget that maintains the input text and results.
// 4. The user enters text into a TextField, which updates the _inputText variable.
// 5. When the user presses the "Analyze Text" button, the _analyzeText function is called.
// 6. This function performs sentiment analysis and keyword extraction using the text_analysis package.
// 7. The results are displayed on the screen, showing the sentiment and extracted keywords.
