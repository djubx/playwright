Here's a detailed technical blog on the "conventional_commit" Flutter package, structured as requested.

## <-- START_DESCRIPTION -->

# Overview of the `conventional_commit` Flutter Package

The `conventional_commit` package is a Flutter library designed to facilitate the implementation of the Conventional Commits specification in your Flutter projects. This specification provides a standardized way to write commit messages, which can help in automating versioning and changelog generation. By adhering to this convention, developers can ensure that their commit messages are clear, consistent, and informative.

### When to Use

You should consider using the `conventional_commit` package in the following scenarios:

- **Automated Versioning**: If your project requires automated versioning based on commit messages, this package can help you achieve that.
- **Changelog Generation**: For projects that need to maintain a changelog, using conventional commit messages can simplify the process of generating this documentation.
- **Team Collaboration**: In a team environment, having a consistent commit message format can improve communication and understanding of changes made to the codebase.

### Features

- **Commit Message Validation**: Ensures that commit messages follow the Conventional Commits format.
- **Version Bumping**: Automatically bumps the version number based on the types of commits made (e.g., major, minor, patch).
- **Changelog Generation**: Generates a changelog based on the commit history, making it easier to track changes over time.

# Setting Up the `conventional_commit` Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `conventional_commit` package in a Flutter project. We will cover platform-specific details for both Android and iOS.

### Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `conventional_commit` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  conventional_commit: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android Configuration

1. Open the `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

#### iOS Configuration

1. Open the `ios/Podfile`.
2. Uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

### Step 4: Using the Package

Now that the package is set up, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `conventional_commit` package in your app.

# Complete Example of Using `conventional_commit`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:conventional_commit/conventional_commit.dart'; // Import the package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Conventional Commit Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: CommitHomePage(), // Set the home page
    );
  }
}

class CommitHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CommitHomePageState createState() => _CommitHomePageState();
}

class _CommitHomePageState extends State<CommitHomePage> {
  String _commitMessage = ''; // Variable to hold the commit message

  // Function to validate the commit message
  void _validateCommit() {
    final isValid = ConventionalCommit.validate(_commitMessage);
    if (isValid) {
      // If valid, show a success message
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Commit message is valid!')),
      );
    } else {
      // If invalid, show an error message
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Invalid commit message format!')),
      );
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Conventional Commit Example'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter commit message'),
              onChanged: (value) {
                _commitMessage = value; // Update commit message on change
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _validateCommit, // Validate on button press
              child: Text('Validate Commit Message'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home page is set to CommitHomePage, which is a stateful widget.
// 4. In CommitHomePage, a TextField is provided for the user to enter a commit message.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the _validateCommit function is called.
// 6. This function uses the ConventionalCommit.validate method to check the format of the commit message.
// 7. Depending on the validation result, a SnackBar is shown to inform the user whether the commit message is valid or not.
```

### Summary

In this blog, we explored the `conventional_commit` Flutter package, detailing its purpose, features, and setup process. We provided a complete example of a Flutter application that demonstrates how to validate commit messages using this package. The application flow was explained step-by-step through comments in the code, making it easy to understand how the package integrates into a Flutter project. By following this guide, developers can effectively implement the Conventional Commits specification in their Flutter applications, enhancing their version control practices.
