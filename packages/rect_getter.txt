# Overview of the `rect_getter` Flutter Package

The `rect_getter` package is a powerful utility in Flutter that allows developers to retrieve the rectangle (Rect) of a widget. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where you need to know the position and size of a widget on the screen, such as when creating custom animations, overlays, or tooltips that need to align with specific widgets.

## When to Use `rect_getter`

- **Custom Animations**: When you need to animate widgets based on their position or size.
- **Overlays and Tooltips**: To position overlays or tooltips relative to a widget.
- **Debugging Layouts**: To understand the layout and positioning of widgets during development.

## Features

- **Easy Integration**: Simple API to wrap widgets and retrieve their Rect.
- **Platform Agnostic**: Works seamlessly across Android and iOS.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal performance overhead.

The `rect_getter` package is a must-have for Flutter developers looking to create dynamic and responsive UI components that require precise widget positioning.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `rect_getter`

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up and using the `rect_getter` package in a Flutter project. We will cover platform-specific configurations for both Android and iOS.

## Setup Process

1. **Add Dependency**

   Add `rect_getter` to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     rect_getter: ^0.1.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**

   Run the following command to install the new package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configurations**

   The `rect_getter` package does not require any additional platform-specific configurations for Android or iOS, making it straightforward to integrate.

## Using `rect_getter`

To use `rect_getter`, you need to wrap the widget you want to measure with `RectGetter`. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Import the Package**

   ```dart
   import 'package:rect_getter/rect_getter.dart';
   ```

2. **Wrap the Widget**

   Wrap the widget you want to measure with `RectGetter` and assign a key:

   ```dart
   final key = RectGetter.createGlobalKey();

   Widget build(BuildContext context) {
     return RectGetter(
       key: key,
       child: YourWidget(),
     );
   }
   ```

3. **Retrieve the Rect**

   Use the `RectGetter.getRectFromKey` method to retrieve the Rect:

   ```dart
   Rect? rect = RectGetter.getRectFromKey(key);
   ```

This setup allows you to easily retrieve the position and size of any widget wrapped with `RectGetter`.

# Complete Example: Using `rect_getter` in a Flutter App

Below is a complete example of a Flutter application that demonstrates the key features of the `rect_getter` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:rect_getter/rect_getter.dart';

// Main entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// Main application widget
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Rect Getter Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

// Home screen widget
class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

// State class for HomeScreen
class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  // Create a global key for RectGetter
  final GlobalKey rectGetterKey = RectGetter.createGlobalKey();
  Rect? rect;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Rect Getter Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Wrap the target widget with RectGetter
            RectGetter(
              key: rectGetterKey,
              child: ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Retrieve the Rect of the button when pressed
                  setState(() {
                    rect = RectGetter.getRectFromKey(rectGetterKey);
                  });
                },
                child: Text('Get My Rect'),
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Display the retrieved Rect
            if (rect != null)
              Text(
                'Rect: ${rect.toString()}',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
              ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// Explanation of Application Flow
// 1. The application starts with the `main` function, which runs `MyApp`.
// 2. `MyApp` is a stateless widget that sets up the MaterialApp and specifies `HomeScreen` as the home widget.
// 3. `HomeScreen` is a stateful widget that uses `RectGetter` to wrap an `ElevatedButton`.
// 4. A global key `rectGetterKey` is created to uniquely identify the `RectGetter` widget.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the `RectGetter.getRectFromKey` method is called to retrieve the Rect of the button.
// 6. The retrieved Rect is displayed below the button, showing its position and size on the screen.
