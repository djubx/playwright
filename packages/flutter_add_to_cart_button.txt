# Tutorial: Setting Up flutter_add_to_cart_button

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_add_to_cart_button` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_add_to_cart_button` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_add_to_cart_button: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install Packages

Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure to enable the necessary permissions in your `Info.plist` if your app requires any specific capabilities. However, the `flutter_add_to_cart_button` package does not require any special permissions.

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is an example of how to implement the `Add to Cart` button.

# Complete Example of flutter_add_to_cart_button

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_add_to_cart_button/flutter_add_to_cart_button.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Add to Cart Button Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: ProductPage(),
    );
  }
}

class ProductPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ProductPageState createState() => _ProductPageState();
}

class _ProductPageState extends State<ProductPage> {
  // Variable to keep track of the cart item count
  int cartItemCount = 0;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Product Page'),
        actions: [
          // Display the cart item count in the app bar
          Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
            child: Center(
              child: Text('Cart: $cartItemCount'),
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display product information
            Text(
              'Product Name',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(
              '\$29.99',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, color: Colors.green),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 40),
            // Add to Cart button
            AddToCartButton(
              icon: Icon(Icons.add_shopping_cart),
              onPressed: () {
                // Increment the cart item count when the button is pressed
                setState(() {
                  cartItemCount++;
                });
              },
              // Customize the button's appearance
              buttonColor: Colors.blue,
              buttonText: 'Add to Cart',
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation

// The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `MyApp` widget.
// `MyApp` sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme, and it directs to the `ProductPage`.
// The `ProductPage` is a stateful widget that maintains the cart item count.
// In the `build` method, we create a Scaffold with an AppBar displaying the cart item count.
// The body contains a centered column with product details and the "Add to Cart" button.
// When the button is pressed, the `onPressed` callback increments the `cartItemCount` variable.
// The UI updates to reflect the new cart item count, providing immediate feedback to the user.
