# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Image Gallery Saver Plus

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `image_gallery_saver_plus` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  image_gallery_saver_plus: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the current version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. **Permissions**: Open `AndroidManifest.xml` located in `android/app/src/main/` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

2. **Target SDK**: Ensure your `targetSdkVersion` is set to 29 or higher in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    compileSdkVersion 31
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        targetSdkVersion 31
    }
}
```

### iOS
1. **Permissions**: Open `Info.plist` located in `ios/Runner/` and add the following keys:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to save images to your photo library.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save images.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to save an image to the gallery:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:image_gallery_saver_plus/image_gallery_saver_plus.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Image Gallery Saver Plus Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Replace with your image URL or asset
              final imageUrl = 'https://example.com/image.png';
              final result = await ImageGallerySaver.saveImage(imageUrl);
              // Display the result
              print(result);
            },
            child: Text('Save Image'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, the specified image will be saved to the device's gallery.

# Complete Example: RealFlutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:image_gallery_saver_plus/image_gallery_saver_plus.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Image Gallery Saver Plus Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Define the image URL to be saved
              final imageUrl = 'https://example.com/image.png';
              
              // Call the saveImage method from the package
              final result = await ImageGallerySaver.saveImage(imageUrl);
              
              // Print the result to the console for debugging
              print(result);
            },
            child: Text('Save Image'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. A MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is displayed.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the onPressed callback is triggered.
// 5. The image URL is defined, and the saveImage method is called from the image_gallery_saver_plus package.
// 6. The result of the save operation is printed to the console, which can be used for debugging or user feedback.
