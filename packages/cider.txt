# Cider Flutter Package

The **Cider** package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers, designed to simplify the process of managing and displaying data in a structured manner. It provides a set of utilities that help in creating responsive and dynamic user interfaces, making it easier to handle complex data structures.

## When to Use Cider

Cider is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to:
- Display lists of data with varying layouts.
- Manage state efficiently across different parts of your application.
- Create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Layouts**: Easily create responsive layouts that adjust based on the data provided.
- **State Management**: Built-in support for managing state, making it easier to keep your UI in sync with your data.
- **Custom Widgets**: A variety of customizable widgets that can be tailored to fit your application's needs.

In summary, Cider is an excellent choice for Flutter developers looking to enhance their applications with dynamic data management and responsive design capabilities.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Cider

## Step 1: Adding Cider to Your Project

To get started with the Cider package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cider: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter and Cider:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # Ensure this is set to at least 10.0
```

## Step 3: Using Cider in Your Application

Now that you have set up the Cider package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a responsive list using Cider.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:cider/cider.dart';
```

2. Create a simple widget that utilizes Cider's features:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Cider Example')),
      body: CiderList(
        items: ['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3'],
        itemBuilder: (context, item) {
          return ListTile(title: Text(item));
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to create a basic list using Cider's `CiderList` widget, which automatically handles the layout and state management for you.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the Cider package into your Flutter application seamlessly.

# Complete Example of Cider in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cider/cider.dart'; // Importing the Cider package

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp()); // Entry point of the application
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Cider Example',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: RealFlutter(), // Setting the home widget
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Cider Example')), // App bar title
      body: CiderList(
        items: ['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3'], // List of items to display
        itemBuilder: (context, item) {
          return ListTile(title: Text(item)); // Building each list item
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application, which calls runApp().
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to RealFlutter, which is the main screen of the app.
// 4. RealFlutter builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body that contains a CiderList.
// 5. CiderList takes a list of items and an itemBuilder function to create ListTile widgets for each item.
// 6. The app displays a simple list of items, demonstrating the use of the Cider package for dynamic layouts.
```
