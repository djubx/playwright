# Tutorial: Setting Up flutter_chat_reactions

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_chat_reactions` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_chat_reactions` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_chat_reactions: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install Packages

Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable the use of Swift in your project. Open your `ios/Podfile` and ensure the platform is set to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_chat_reactions/flutter_chat_reactions.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package

You can now use the `ChatReactions` widget in your application. Here‚Äôs a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
ChatReactions(
  onReactionChanged: (reaction) {
    // Handle the reaction change
    print('User reacted with: $reaction');
  },
  reactions: [
    'üëç', // Thumbs Up
    '‚ù§Ô∏è', // Heart
    'üòÇ', // Laugh
    'üòÆ', // Surprised
    'üò¢', // Sad
  ],
)
```

This widget will display a set of reactions, and when a user selects one, it will trigger the `onReactionChanged` callback.

## Conclusion

You have now set up the `flutter_chat_reactions` package in your Flutter application. You can customize the reactions and handle user interactions effectively.

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_chat_reactions/flutter_chat_reactions.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Chat Reactions Example',
      home: ChatScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ChatScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ChatScreenState createState() => _ChatScreenState();
}

class _ChatScreenState extends State<ChatScreen> {
  // List to hold messages and their reactions
  List<Map<String, dynamic>> messages = [
    {'text': 'Hello!', 'reaction': ''},
    {'text': 'How are you?', 'reaction': ''},
  ];

  // Function to update the reaction for a message
  void _updateReaction(int index, String reaction) {
    setState(() {
      messages[index]['reaction'] = reaction; // Update the reaction
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Chat Reactions'),
      ),
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: messages.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return ListTile(
            title: Text(messages[index]['text']), // Display message text
            subtitle: Row(
              children: [
                Text(messages[index]['reaction']), // Display current reaction
                IconButton(
                  icon: Icon(Icons.reaction), // Reaction button
                  onPressed: () {
                    // Show chat reactions when button is pressed
                    showDialog(
                      context: context,
                      builder: (context) {
                        return AlertDialog(
                          content: ChatReactions(
                            onReactionChanged: (reaction) {
                              _updateReaction(index, reaction); // Update reaction
                              Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close dialog
                            },
                            reactions: [
                              'üëç', // Thumbs Up
                              '‚ù§Ô∏è', // Heart
                              'üòÇ', // Laugh
                              'üòÆ', // Surprised
                              'üò¢', // Sad
                            ],
                          ),
                        );
                      },
                    );
                  },
                ),
              ],
            ),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (ChatScreen).
// 3. ChatScreen maintains a list of messages, each with a text and a reaction.
// 4. The ListView.builder creates a list of messages, displaying each message and its current reaction.
// 5. When the reaction button is pressed, an AlertDialog is shown with the ChatReactions widget.
// 6. The user can select a reaction, which updates the corresponding message's reaction and closes the dialog.
```
