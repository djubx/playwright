# Overview of the `spoiler_widget` Flutter Package

The `spoiler_widget` package is a versatile Flutter library designed to create interactive spoiler elements in your applications. This package is particularly useful for applications that deal with content that may contain spoilers, such as movie reviews, book summaries, or game guides. By using this package, developers can enhance user experience by allowing users to reveal or hide content at their discretion.

## When to Use `spoiler_widget`

- **Content with Spoilers**: If your app displays content that may spoil the experience for users (e.g., plot details of a movie or game), this package allows you to manage that content effectively.
- **User Control**: It empowers users to control what they see, making the app more user-friendly and engaging.
- **Interactive UI**: It adds an interactive element to your UI, making it more dynamic and appealing.

## Features

- **Customizable Appearance**: You can easily customize the look and feel of the spoiler widget to match your app's theme.
- **Toggle Functionality**: Users can click to reveal or hide the spoiler content, providing a seamless experience.
- **Accessibility**: The package is designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring that all users can interact with the spoilers easily.

Overall, the `spoiler_widget` package is a valuable addition to any Flutter application that requires content management with user interaction.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `spoiler_widget`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `spoiler_widget` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  spoiler_widget: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the `spoiler_widget`

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the `spoiler_widget` in your app:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:spoiler_widget/spoiler_widget.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Spoiler Widget Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: SpoilerWidget(
            title: Text('Click to reveal spoiler'),
            content: Text('This is the spoiler content that can be hidden.'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that uses the `spoiler_widget` to display a clickable title that reveals the spoiler content when tapped.

# Complete Example of `spoiler_widget`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:spoiler_widget/spoiler_widget.dart';

// Main class of the Flutter application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Spoiler Widget Example'), // Title of the app
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: SpoilerWidget(
            title: Text('Click to reveal spoiler'), // Title that users can click
            content: Text('This is the spoiler content that can be hidden.'), // Content that will be revealed
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the RealFlutter app
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp, which provides the basic structure for the app.
3. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold widget is created, which includes an AppBar and a body.
4. The AppBar displays the title of the application.
5. The body contains a Center widget that centers its child, which is the SpoilerWidget.
6. The SpoilerWidget has a title that users can click on to reveal the hidden content.
7. When the title is clicked, the content is displayed, allowing users to interact with the spoiler functionality.
