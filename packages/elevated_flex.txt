# Elevated Flex: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation

To get started with the `elevated_flex` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  elevated_flex: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/elevated_flex).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage

To use the `elevated_flex` package, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:elevated_flex/elevated_flex.dart';
```

You can then create an elevated button using the `ElevatedFlex` widget. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
ElevatedFlex(
  onPressed: () {
    // Action to perform on button press
  },
  child: Text('Click Me'),
  elevation: 4.0,
  color: Colors.blue,
);
```

This code creates a basic elevated button with a specified elevation and color. You can customize it further by adjusting its properties.

# Complete Example of Elevated Flex

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:elevated_flex/elevated_flex.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Elevated Flex Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Elevated Flex Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedFlex(
            onPressed: () {
              // Action to perform on button press
              print('Elevated button pressed!');
            },
            child: Text('Click Me'),
            elevation: 8.0, // Set the elevation for the button
            color: Colors.blue, // Set the button color
            shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(
              borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(12.0), // Rounded corners
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, we create an ElevatedFlex button.
// 5. The button has an onPressed callback that prints a message to the console when clicked.
// 6. The button's elevation is set to 8.0, giving it a raised appearance.
// 7. The button's color is set to blue, and it has rounded corners defined by the shape property.
// 8. When the button is pressed, the action defined in the onPressed callback is executed.
