## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }

## Step 5: Using the Balloon Slider
You can now use the `BalloonSlider` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

BalloonSlider(
  min: 0,
  max: 100,
  divisions: 10,

# Complete Example of Flutter Balloon Slider

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_balloon_slider/flutter_balloon_slider.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Balloon Slider Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Balloon Slider Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: BalloonSliderDemo(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class BalloonSliderDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _BalloonSliderDemoState createState() => _BalloonSliderDemoState();
}

class _BalloonSliderDemoState extends State<BalloonSliderDemo> {
  double _currentValue = 50; // Initial value for the slider

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        // Display the current value above the slider
        Text(
          'Current Value: ${_currentValue.toStringAsFixed(0)}',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20), // Add some space between the text and slider
        // BalloonSlider widget
        BalloonSlider(
          min: 0, // Minimum value of the slider
          max: 100, // Maximum value of the slider
          divisions: 10, // Number of divisions in the slider
          value: _currentValue, // Current value of the slider
          onChanged: (value) {
            setState(() {
              _currentValue = value; // Update the current value
            });
          },
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds the BalloonSliderDemo.
// 4. BalloonSliderDemo is a StatefulWidget that maintains the current value of the slider.
// 5. The build method of _BalloonSliderDemoState creates a Column with a Text widget displaying the current value and a BalloonSlider.
// 6. When the slider is moved, the onChanged callback updates the current value and rebuilds the UI to reflect the new value.
```
