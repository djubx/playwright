# Tutorial

## Setup Process

To get started with the `record_mp3` package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add Dependency
Add the `record_mp3` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  record_mp3: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

### Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version required
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

#### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request microphone access:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone to record audio.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save recordings.</string>
```

### Step 3: Import the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:record_mp3/record_mp3.dart';
```

## Using the Package

### Basic Usage Example
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the `record_mp3` package to record audio:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:record_mp3/record_mp3.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  bool isRecording = false;

  void startRecording() async {
    // Start recording audio
    await RecordMp3.start('audio.mp3', 44100, 2);
    setState(() {
      isRecording = true;
    });
  }

  void stopRecording() async {
    // Stop recording audio
    await RecordMp3.stop();
    setState(() {
      isRecording = false;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Record MP3 Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: isRecording ? stopRecording : startRecording,
              child: Text(isRecording ? 'Stop Recording' : 'Start Recording'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple UI with a button to start and stop recording audio. The `startRecording` and `stopRecording` methods handle the recording logic.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:record_mp3/record_mp3.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  bool isRecording = false; // State variable to track recording status

  void startRecording() async {
    // Start recording audio and save it as 'audio.mp3' with specified quality
    await RecordMp3.start('audio.mp3', 44100, 2);
    setState(() {
      isRecording = true; // Update state to indicate recording has started
    });
  }

  void stopRecording() async {
    // Stop the audio recording
    await RecordMp3.stop();
    setState(() {
      isRecording = false; // Update state to indicate recording has stopped
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Record MP3 Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: isRecording ? stopRecording : startRecording,
              child: Text(isRecording ? 'Stop Recording' : 'Start Recording'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 2. The _RealFlutterState class manages the recording state with a boolean variable 'isRecording'.
// 3. The startRecording method is called when the user presses the button to start recording.
// 4. This method invokes RecordMp3.start() to begin recording audio and updates the state.
// 5. When the user presses the button again, the stopRecording method is called, which stops the recording.
// 6. The UI updates accordingly to reflect the current recording status.
```
