# Complete Example

Here’s a complete example of a Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the `number_to_vietnamese_words` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:number_to_vietnamese_words/number_to_vietnamese_words.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Number to Vietnamese Words',
      home: NumberConverterScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class NumberConverterScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _NumberConverterScreenState createState() => _NumberConverterScreenState();
}

class _NumberConverterScreenState extends State<NumberConverterScreen> {
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController();
  String _result = '';

  // Function to convert the input number to Vietnamese words
  void _convertNumber() {
    // Get the input from the text field
    String input = _controller.text;

    // Try to parse the input to an integer
    try {
      int number = int.parse(input);
      // Convert the number to Vietnamese words
      _result = NumberToVietnameseWords.convert(number);
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any parsing errors
      _result = 'Invalid number';
    }

    // Update the UI with the result
    setState(() {});
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Convert Number to Vietnamese Words'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              controller: _controller,
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Enter a number',
              ),
              keyboardType: TextInputType.number,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _convertNumber,
              child: Text('Convert'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(
              'Result: $_result',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp with a title and home screen.
// 3. The NumberConverterScreen is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the input and result.
// 4. The user enters a number in the TextField, which is controlled by _controller.
// 5. When the user presses the 'Convert' button, the _convertNumber function is called.
// 6. This function attempts to parse the input as an integer and convert it to Vietnamese words.
// 7. If successful, the result is displayed; otherwise, an error message is shown.
// 8. The UI updates to reflect the conversion result.
```
