# Easy_Mask Flutter Package

The **easy_mask** Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to simplify the process of applying input masks to text fields in Flutter applications. Input masks are particularly useful for formatting user input, such as phone numbers, credit card numbers, dates, and other structured data. This package allows developers to create user-friendly forms that guide users in entering data in the correct format.

## When to Use Easy_Mask

You should consider using the easy_mask package in scenarios where:
- You need to enforce a specific format for user input.
- You want to improve the user experience by providing visual cues for data entry.
- You are developing applications that require structured data input, such as forms for registration, payment, or contact information.

## Features

- **Customizable Masks**: Define your own input masks to suit your application's needs.
- **Flexible Input Types**: Supports various input types, including text, numbers, and dates.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate into existing Flutter projects with minimal setup.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

With these features, easy_mask enhances the data entry experience, ensuring that users provide input in the desired format while reducing the likelihood of errors.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Easy_Mask

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the easy_mask package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the easy_mask package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  easy_mask: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` file to allow for certain permissions, depending on your app's requirements. However, for basic usage of easy_mask, no specific configurations are required.

## Step 3: Using Easy_Mask in Your Application

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in a Flutter widget. Below is an example of how to implement an input mask for a phone number.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:easy_mask/easy_mask.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Easy Mask Example'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Column(
            children: [
              TextField(
                decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Phone Number'),
                keyboardType: TextInputType.phone,
                inputFormatters: [
                  MaskedTextInputFormatter(
                    mask: '(##) #####-####',
                    separator: '#',
                  ),
                ],
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with a text field for entering a phone number. The input mask ensures that the user enters the number in the format `(XX) XXXXX-XXXX`.

# Complete Example of Easy_Mask

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:easy_mask/easy_mask.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Easy Mask Example'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Column(
            children: [
              // TextField for Phone Number with Mask
              TextField(
                decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Phone Number'),
                keyboardType: TextInputType.phone,
                inputFormatters: [
                  // Applying the MaskedTextInputFormatter
                  MaskedTextInputFormatter(
                    mask: '(##) #####-####', // Mask format
                    separator: '#', // Character used for masking
                  ),
                ],
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between fields
              // TextField for Date with Mask
              TextField(
                decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Date (DD/MM/YYYY)'),
                keyboardType: TextInputType.datetime,
                inputFormatters: [
                  // Applying the MaskedTextInputFormatter for date
                  MaskedTextInputFormatter(
                    mask: '##/##/####', // Mask format for date
                    separator: '/', // Character used for masking
                  ),
                ],
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a body.
// 3. The body consists of a Column with two TextFields:
//    - The first TextField is for entering a phone number, with a mask applied to format the input as (XX) XXXXX-XXXX.
//    - The second TextField is for entering a date, with a mask applied to format the input as DD/MM/YYYY.
// 4. The MaskedTextInputFormatter is used to enforce the input format, providing a better user experience by guiding the user on how to enter the data correctly.
