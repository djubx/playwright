# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Google Maps Place Picker MB

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `google_maps_place_picker_mb` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependencies

First, you need to add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  google_maps_place_picker_mb: ^latest_version
  google_maps_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the packages.

## Step 2: Configure Android

For Android, you need to add the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/>
```

Also, ensure you have the Google Maps API key set up in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<meta-data
    android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
    android:value="YOUR_API_KEY"/>
```

## Step 3: Configure iOS

For iOS, you need to add the following permissions in your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show places near you.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show places near you.</string>
```

Also, ensure you have the Google Maps API key set up in your `AppDelegate.swift`:

```swift
GMSServices.provideAPIKey("YOUR_API_KEY")
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Below is an example of how to implement the place picker.

# Complete Example of Google Maps Place Picker MB

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:google_maps_place_picker_mb/google_maps_place_picker_mb.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Place Picker Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  // Define your Google Maps API key
  static const String apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Google Maps Place Picker'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate to the Place Picker screen
            Navigator.of(context).push(MaterialPageRoute(
              builder: (context) => PlacePickerScreen(),
            ));
          },
          child: Text('Pick a Place'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class PlacePickerScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return PlacePicker(
      apiKey: RealFlutter.apiKey,
      onPlacePicked: (result) {
        // Handle the selected place
        Navigator.of(context).pop(result);
      },
      initialPosition: LatLng(37.7749, -122.4194), // San Francisco
      useCurrentLocation: true,
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The home screen is RealFlutter, which contains a button to pick a place.
// 3. When the button is pressed, it navigates to the PlacePickerScreen.
// 4. The PlacePickerScreen displays the map and allows the user to select a place.
// 5. Once a place is selected, the onPlacePicked callback is triggered, and the selected place is returned to the previous screen.
```

// The application flow is as follows:
// - The app initializes and displays the main screen with a button.
// - When the user taps the button, it navigates to the Place Picker screen.
// - The user can then select a location on the map.
// - After selecting a place, the app returns to the main screen, where you can handle the selected place as needed.
