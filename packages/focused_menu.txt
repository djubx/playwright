# Focused Menu Flutter Package

The **focused_menu** Flutter package is a powerful tool that allows developers to create context menus that can be displayed when a user long-presses on a widget. This package is particularly useful for applications that require additional options or actions related to a specific item without cluttering the user interface. 

## When to Use

You might consider using the focused_menu package in scenarios such as:
- **Contextual Actions**: When you want to provide users with actions related to a specific item, like editing or deleting.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: To keep the UI clean while still offering functionality.
- **Customizable Menus**: When you need a menu that can be tailored to fit the design and functionality of your app.

## Features
- **Customizable Menu Items**: You can easily add, remove, or modify menu items.
- **Animations**: The package supports smooth animations for menu appearance and disappearance.
- **Flexible Positioning**: Menus can be positioned relative to the widget that triggers them.
- **Platform Compatibility**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.

Overall, the focused_menu package enhances the interactivity of Flutter applications by providing a simple yet effective way to implement context menus.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Focused Menu

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the focused_menu package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  focused_menu: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the focused_menu package:

```dart
import 'package:focused_menu/focused_menu.dart';
import 'package:focused_menu/focused_menu_holder.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using Focused Menu

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 5: Implementing Focused Menu

You can now implement the focused menu in your widget tree. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
FocusedMenuHolder(
  onPressed: () {},
  menuItems: [
    FocusedMenuItem(
      title: Text("Edit"),
      onPressed: () {
        // Handle edit action
      },
    ),
    FocusedMenuItem(
      title: Text("Delete"),
      onPressed: () {
        // Handle delete action
      },
    ),
  ],
  child: Container(
    padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
    color: Colors.blue,
    child: Text("Long Press Me"),
  ),
);
```

This code creates a container that, when long-pressed, shows a menu with "Edit" and "Delete" options.

## Conclusion

You have now set up the focused_menu package in your Flutter application. You can customize the menu items and their actions as per your requirements.

# Complete Example of Focused Menu

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:focused_menu/focused_menu.dart';
import 'package:focused_menu/focused_menu_holder.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Focused Menu Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Focused Menu Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: FocusedMenuHolder(
            onPressed: () {},
            menuItems: [
              FocusedMenuItem(
                title: Text("Edit"),
                onPressed: () {
                  // Handle edit action
                  print("Edit action triggered");
                },
              ),
              FocusedMenuItem(
                title: Text("Delete"),
                onPressed: () {
                  // Handle delete action
                  print("Delete action triggered");
                },
              ),
            ],
            child: Container(
              padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
              color: Colors.blue,
              child: Text(
                "Long Press Me",
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds the FocusedMenuHolder.
// 4. The FocusedMenuHolder wraps a Container that displays "Long Press Me".
// 5. When the user long-presses the container, the menu items "Edit" and "Delete" appear.
// 6. Tapping on "Edit" or "Delete" triggers the respective actions, which currently print messages to the console.
