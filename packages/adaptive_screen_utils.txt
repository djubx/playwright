```xml
<application
    ...
    android:screenDensity="hdpi"
    android:screenSize="normal"
    ...>
```

#### iOS
On iOS, you can configure the screen size and orientation in the `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>UISupportedInterfaceOrientations</key>
<array>
    <string>UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait</string>
    <string>UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft</string>

              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Use the AdaptiveScreenUtils instance to create a responsive image
              AdaptiveImage(
                // Set the image's size and orientation
                size: _adaptiveScreenUtils.setSize(200, 100),
                orientation: _adaptiveScreenUtils.setOrientation(
                  ScreenOrientation.landscape,
                ),
                image: AssetImage('assets/image.png'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and the AdaptiveScreenUtils instance is created.
// 2. The AdaptiveScreenUtils instance sets the screen size and orientation.
// 3. The app's UI is built using the AdaptiveScreenUtils instance.
// 4. The AdaptiveScreenUtils instance creates a responsive layout and image.
// 5. The app's UI is displayed to the user.

// In summary, the AdaptiveScreenUtils package helps to create responsive and adaptive UI designs.
// It provides a set of tools to handle different screen sizes, orientations, and densities.
// The package can be used to create complex and dynamic UI designs that adapt to different devices and screen sizes.
