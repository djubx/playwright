## Tutorial: Setting Up Wazeloquent

### Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with Wazeloquent, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  wazeloquent: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

### Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/>
```

#### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys for location permissions:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to provide navigation services.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to provide navigation services.</string>
```

### Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initialize and use Wazeloquent:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:wazeloquent/wazeloquent.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Wazeloquent Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Wazeloquent Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Initialize Waze with a destination
            Waze.openWaze(
              lat: 37.7749,
              lng: -122.4194,
              name: "San Francisco",
            );
          },
          child: Text('Open Waze Navigation'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Running the App

After completing the setup, you can run your app on an emulator or a physical device. Make sure to test the navigation feature to ensure everything is working correctly.

## Complete Example: Wazeloquent in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:wazeloquent/wazeloquent.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Wazeloquent Navigation Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Wazeloquent Navigation Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Open Waze with specified destination coordinates and name
            Waze.openWaze(
              lat: 37.7749, // Latitude for San Francisco
              lng: -122.4194, // Longitude for San Francisco
              name: "San Francisco", // Name of the destination
            );
          },
          child: Text('Navigate to San Francisco'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets HomeScreen as the home widget.
// 3. HomeScreen contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. The Center widget holds an ElevatedButton that, when pressed, calls Waze.openWaze().
// 5. Waze.openWaze() is invoked with the latitude and longitude of San Francisco, along with the destination name.
// 6. This action opens the Waze app with navigation directions to the specified location.
```
