# Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `flutter_core_spotlight` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_core_spotlight: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions. Typically, no special permissions are required for this package, but ensure your app's minimum SDK version is compatible.

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add specific configurations in your `Info.plist` file if you are using features that require permissions. However, for basic spotlight functionality, no additional configurations are necessary.

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_core_spotlight/flutter_core_spotlight.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

To use the spotlight feature, you can create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class and configure the spotlight as needed. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to implement it:

```dart
// Create a spotlight instance
final spotlight = Spotlight(
  targets: [
    Target(
      identify: 'target1',
      description: 'This is the first target',
      key: 'target1_key',
      shape: Shape.Circle,
      radius: 50,
    ),
    // Add more targets as needed
  ],
);
```

You can then trigger the spotlight in your application, typically after a user action or during the onboarding process.

# Complete Example of Using flutter_core_spotlight

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_core_spotlight/flutter_core_spotlight.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Core Spotlight Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Start the spotlight when the button is pressed
            startSpotlight(context);
          },
          child: Text('Show Spotlight'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void startSpotlight(BuildContext context) {
    // Define the targets for the spotlight
    final spotlight = Spotlight(
      targets: [
        Target(
          identify: 'target1',
          description: 'This is the first target',
          key: 'target1_key',
          shape: Shape.Circle,
          radius: 50,
        ),
        Target(
          identify: 'target2',
          description: 'This is the second target',
          key: 'target2_key',
          shape: Shape.Rectangle,
          radius: 20,
        ),
      ],
      onTargetClick: (target) {
        // Handle target click
        print('Clicked on: ${target.identify}');
      },
    );

    // Start the spotlight
    spotlight.start(context);
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. HomeScreen contains a button that, when pressed, triggers the startSpotlight method.
// 4. The startSpotlight method creates a Spotlight instance with defined targets.
// 5. When the spotlight is started, it highlights the specified targets, allowing users to interact with them.
// 6. Clicking on a target triggers the onTargetClick callback, where you can define custom behavior.
```

## Summary of Application Flow

The application starts with the `main` function, which initializes the Flutter app. The `MyApp` class builds a simple user interface with a button on the home screen. When the button is pressed, it calls the `startSpotlight` method, which creates a `Spotlight` instance with defined targets. The spotlight highlights these targets, allowing users to interact with them. Clicking on a target triggers a callback, enabling developers to define custom actions based on user interactions.

This structured approach to using the `flutter_core_spotlight` package not only enhances user experience but also provides a clear and engaging way to guide users through your application.
