# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Extended Masked Text Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `extended_masked_text` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  extended_masked_text: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` file to include any necessary permissions, especially if you are using features that require user data.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a masked text field.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:extended_masked_text/extended_masked_text.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a controller for the masked text field
    final controller = MaskedTextController(mask: '(000) 000-0000');

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Extended Masked Text Example'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Column(
            children: [
              TextField(
                controller: controller,
                decoration: InputDecoration(
                  labelText: 'Phone Number',
                  hintText: '(123) 456-7890',
                ),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Print the entered phone number
                  print('Entered Phone Number: ${controller.text}');
                },
                child: Text('Submit'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

# Complete Example of Using Extended Masked Text

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:extended_masked_text/extended_masked_text.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a controller for the masked text field
    final controller = MaskedTextController(mask: '(000) 000-0000');

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Extended Masked Text Example'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Column(
            children: [
              // TextField for phone number input
              TextField(
                controller: controller,
                decoration: InputDecoration(
                  labelText: 'Phone Number',
                  hintText: '(123) 456-7890',
                ),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Button to submit the entered phone number
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Print the entered phone number
                  print('Entered Phone Number: ${controller.text}');
                },
                child: Text('Submit'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a body.
// 3. Inside the body, a TextField is created for phone number input, using a MaskedTextController to enforce the mask '(000) 000-0000'.
// 4. When the user types in the TextField, the input is formatted according to the mask, guiding the user to enter a valid phone number.
// 5. An ElevatedButton is provided to submit the entered phone number. When pressed, it prints the entered phone number to the console.
// 6. This simple flow demonstrates how to use the extended_masked_text package to create a user-friendly input field for phone numbers.
