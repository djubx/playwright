# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using wtf_rotary_dial

## Installation
To use the `wtf_rotary_dial` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  wtf_rotary_dial: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/wtf_rotary_dial).

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package
Once you have installed the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the rotary dial in your app:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:wtf_rotary_dial/wtf_rotary_dial.dart';
```

2. Use the `RotaryDial` widget in your widget tree:

```dart
RotaryDial(
  onDialChanged: (value) {
    // Handle the dial value change
    print("Dial value: $value");
  },
  // Customize the appearance
  size: 200.0,
  backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
  dialColor: Colors.white,
);
```

This will create a basic rotary dial that prints the dial value to the console whenever it is changed.

# Complete Example of wtf_rotary_dial

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:wtf_rotary_dial/wtf_rotary_dial.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Rotary Dial Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Rotary Dial Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: RotaryDial(
            onDialChanged: (value) {
              // This callback is triggered when the dial value changes
              print("Dial value: $value");
            },
            size: 200.0, // Set the size of the dial
            backgroundColor: Colors.blue, // Background color of the dial
            dialColor: Colors.white, // Color of the dial itself
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, we place the RotaryDial widget.
// 5. The RotaryDial widget has an onDialChanged callback that prints the current dial value to the console.
// 6. The size, backgroundColor, and dialColor properties customize the appearance of the rotary dial.
// 7. When the user interacts with the dial, the onDialChanged callback is triggered, allowing us to respond to user input.
