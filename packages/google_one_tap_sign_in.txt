// The code flows as follows:
// 1. The user clicks the "Sign In with Google" button, which triggers the `onPressed` callback.
// 2. The `onPressed` callback signs in with Google using the `GoogleOneTapSignIn` class.
// 3. The `GoogleOneTapSignIn` class redirects the user to the Google authentication page.
// 4. The user authenticates with Google and is redirected back to the app.
// 5. The app handles the sign-in result and retrieves the signed-in account.
// 6. The app uses the signed-in account to authenticate with the backend server.
// 7. The app redirects the user to the protected route.
