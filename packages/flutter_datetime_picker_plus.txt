# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_datetime_picker_plus

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_datetime_picker_plus` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_datetime_picker_plus: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the date and time picker.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_datetime_picker_plus/flutter_datetime_picker_plus.dart';
```

2. Create a button that triggers the date and time picker:

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () {
    DatePicker.showDateTimePicker(context,
        showTitleActions: true,
        onConfirm: (date) {
          print('Selected date: $date');
        },
        currentTime: DateTime.now(),
        locale: LocaleType.en);
  },
  child: Text('Show DateTime Picker'),
)
```

This button will display the date and time picker when pressed, allowing users to select a date and time.

## Step 4: Customization

You can customize the appearance and behavior of the picker by modifying the parameters in the `showDateTimePicker` method. For example, you can change the locale, enable or disable the title, and set the initial date.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the `flutter_datetime_picker_plus` package into your Flutter application seamlessly.

# Complete Example: A Functional Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_datetime_picker_plus/flutter_datetime_picker_plus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'DateTime Picker Plus Example',
      home: DateTimePickerHome(),
    );
  }
}

class DateTimePickerHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DateTimePickerHomeState createState() => _DateTimePickerHomeState();
}

class _DateTimePickerHomeState extends State<DateTimePickerHome> {
  DateTime? selectedDateTime; // Variable to hold the selected date and time

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('DateTime Picker Plus Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display the selected date and time
            Text(
              selectedDateTime == null
                  ? 'No date selected!'
                  : 'Selected date: ${selectedDateTime.toString()}',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to show the date and time picker
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                DatePicker.showDateTimePicker(context,
                    showTitleActions: true,
                    onConfirm: (date) {
                      setState(() {
                        selectedDateTime = date; // Update the selected date and time
                      });
                    },
                    currentTime: DateTime.now(),
                    locale: LocaleType.en);
              },
              child: Text('Show DateTime Picker'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. The home of the app is DateTimePickerHome, a StatefulWidget.
// 4. In DateTimePickerHome, we have a variable selectedDateTime to store the user's selection.
// 5. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 6. Inside the Center widget, we display the selected date or a message if none is selected.
// 7. An ElevatedButton triggers the date and time picker when pressed.
// 8. When the user confirms a selection, the selected date and time are stored in selectedDateTime and displayed on the screen.
```
