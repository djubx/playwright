# Tutorial: Setting Up flutter_radio_player

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_radio_player` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_radio_player` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_radio_player: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. Ensure that your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in `ios/Podfile`:

   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in our Flutter application.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter_radio_player/flutter_radio_player.dart';
   ```

2. Initialize the `RealFlutter` class and set up the player:

   ```dart
   class RealFlutter {
       final FlutterRadioPlayer _radioPlayer = FlutterRadioPlayer();

       void play(String url) {
           _radioPlayer.play(url);
       }

       void pause() {
           _radioPlayer.pause();
       }

       void stop() {
           _radioPlayer.stop();
       }
   }
   ```

With these steps, you are now ready to implement the radio player in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of flutter_radio_player

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_radio_player/flutter_radio_player.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Radio Player',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RadioPlayerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class RadioPlayerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RadioPlayerScreenState createState() => _RadioPlayerScreenState();
}

class _RadioPlayerScreenState extends State<RadioPlayerScreen> {
  final RealFlutter _radioPlayer = RealFlutter();
  bool _isPlaying = false;

  // URL of the radio stream
  final String _radioUrl = 'http://streaming.radio.co/some_radio_stream';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Radio Player'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              _isPlaying ? 'Playing...' : 'Stopped',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _togglePlayPause,
              child: Text(_isPlaying ? 'Pause' : 'Play'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void _togglePlayPause() {
    if (_isPlaying) {
      _radioPlayer.pause();
    } else {
      _radioPlayer.play(_radioUrl);
    }
    setState(() {
      _isPlaying = !_isPlaying;
    });
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the `main` function, which runs the `MyApp` widget.
// 2. `MyApp` sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home screen as `RadioPlayerScreen`.
// 3. In `RadioPlayerScreen`, we create an instance of `RealFlutter` to manage the radio player.
// 4. The UI consists of a text widget to display the current state (Playing/Stopped) and a button to toggle play/pause.
// 5. When the button is pressed, `_togglePlayPause` is called, which either plays or pauses the radio stream based on the current state.
// 6. The state is updated using `setState`, which triggers a rebuild of the UI to reflect the current playing status.
