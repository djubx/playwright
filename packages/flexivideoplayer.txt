# FlexiVideoPlayer: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the **flexivideoplayer** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flexivideoplayer: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flexivideoplayer).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to play videos.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the FlexiVideoPlayer in your Flutter application, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flexivideoplayer/flexivideoplayer.dart';
```

2. Create a simple video player widget:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('FlexiVideoPlayer Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: FlexiVideoPlayer(
          videoUrl: 'https://www.example.com/video.mp4',
          autoPlay: true,
          looping: true,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic video player that plays a video from a URL, automatically starts playing, and loops indefinitely.

With these steps, you can easily integrate the FlexiVideoPlayer into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of FlexiVideoPlayer

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flexivideoplayer/flexivideoplayer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'FlexiVideoPlayer Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // URL of the video to be played
  final String videoUrl = 'https://www.example.com/video.mp4';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('FlexiVideoPlayer Example')),
      body: Center(
        // FlexiVideoPlayer widget to play the video
        child: FlexiVideoPlayer(
          videoUrl: videoUrl, // Set the video URL
          autoPlay: true, // Automatically play the video
          looping: true, // Loop the video playback
          onVideoFinished: () {
            // Callback when the video finishes playing
            print('Video playback completed');
          },
          onError: (error) {
            // Handle any errors during playback
            print('Error occurred: $error');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home of the app is set to RealFlutter, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 4. In RealFlutter, we define a video URL and use the FlexiVideoPlayer widget to play the video.
// 5. The video is set to autoplay and loop.
// 6. Callbacks are provided to handle video completion and errors, which print messages to the console.
