# Setting Up and Using flutter_helper_utils

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `flutter_helper_utils` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_helper_utils: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configurations

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the package to start using its features:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_helper_utils/flutter_helper_utils.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package

You can now use the various utilities provided by the package. For example, to format a date:

```dart
String formattedDate = DateUtils.formatDate(DateTime.now());
```

This will give you a nicely formatted date string based on the current date and time.

By following these steps, you can easily integrate the `flutter_helper_utils` package into your Flutter application and start utilizing its powerful features.

# Complete Example of flutter_helper_utils

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_helper_utils/flutter_helper_utils.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Helper Utils Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Helper Utils Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Using the DateUtils to format the current date
            String formattedDate = DateUtils.formatDate(DateTime.now());
            // Displaying the formatted date in a SnackBar
            ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
              SnackBar(content: Text('Current Date: $formattedDate')),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Show Current Date'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to HomePage, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 4. HomePage builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget containing an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, it calls DateUtils.formatDate to get the current date formatted as a string.
// 6. The formatted date is then displayed in a SnackBar at the bottom of the screen.
```
