# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Dynamic Themes

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **dynamic_themes** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **dynamic_themes** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dynamic_themes: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Configuring the Application

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    compileSdkVersion 31  // Use the latest stable version
    ...
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, ensure that your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file includes the following:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>fetch</string>
</array>
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now, let's implement the dynamic theming in our Flutter application. We will create a simple app that allows users to switch between light and dark themes.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:dynamic_themes/dynamic_themes.dart';
```

2. Wrap your `MaterialApp` with `DynamicTheme`:

```dart
DynamicTheme(
  data: (brightness) => ThemeData(
    primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
    brightness: brightness,
  ),
  themedWidgetBuilder: (context, theme) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dynamic Themes Demo',
      theme: theme,
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  },
);
```

3. Create a simple UI with a button to toggle themes:

```dart
class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Dynamic Themes Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Toggle between light and dark themes
            DynamicTheme.of(context).setThemeData(
              ThemeData(
                brightness: Theme.of(context).brightness == Brightness.dark
                    ? Brightness.light
                    : Brightness.dark,
              ),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Toggle Theme'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

With these steps, you have successfully set up and used the **dynamic_themes** package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Dynamic Themes

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dynamic_themes/dynamic_themes.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return DynamicTheme(
      data: (brightness) => ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
        brightness: brightness,
      ),
      themedWidgetBuilder: (context, theme) {
        return MaterialApp(
          title: 'Dynamic Themes Demo',
          theme: theme,
          home: MyHomePage(),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Dynamic Themes Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Toggle between light and dark themes
            DynamicTheme.of(context).setThemeData(
              ThemeData(
                brightness: Theme.of(context).brightness == Brightness.dark
                    ? Brightness.light
                    : Brightness.dark,
              ),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Toggle Theme'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that wraps the MaterialApp with DynamicTheme.
// 3. DynamicTheme manages the current theme and provides a themedWidgetBuilder.
// 4. The MyHomePage widget is displayed as the home of the MaterialApp.
// 5. In MyHomePage, an ElevatedButton is provided to toggle the theme.
// 6. When the button is pressed, it checks the current brightness and switches to the opposite theme (light/dark).
// 7. The app updates the UI dynamically without needing a restart, providing a seamless user experience.
