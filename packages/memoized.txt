Here's a detailed technical blog on the "memoized" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Memoized Flutter Package

The **memoized** package in Flutter is a powerful tool designed to optimize performance by caching the results of expensive function calls. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the same inputs are likely to produce the same outputs, allowing developers to avoid redundant calculations and improve the responsiveness of their applications.

## When to Use the Memoized Package

You should consider using the memoized package in the following scenarios:

- **Expensive Computations**: When you have functions that perform heavy calculations, such as data processing or complex algorithms, memoization can significantly reduce the time taken for subsequent calls with the same parameters.
- **State Management**: In state management scenarios, where the same data might be requested multiple times, memoization can help in reducing the number of times data is fetched or computed.
- **Rendering Optimization**: When building UI components that rely on computed values, memoization can help in preventing unnecessary rebuilds, thus improving the overall performance of the app.

## Features of the Memoized Package

- **Automatic Caching**: The package automatically caches the results of function calls based on their input parameters.
- **Custom Cache Management**: Developers can customize how the cache is managed, including cache size and expiration policies.
- **Ease of Use**: The package is easy to integrate into existing Flutter applications with minimal setup.

By leveraging the memoized package, developers can create more efficient and responsive applications, enhancing the user experience.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Memoized Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the memoized package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  memoized: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure your `ios/Podfile` has the platform version set to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Memoized Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Here’s a simple example of how to use the memoized function:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:memoized/memoized.dart';

class RealFlutter {
  // A memoized function to calculate the factorial of a number
  final factorial = memoize((int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return 1;
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
  });
}
```

In this example, the `factorial` function is memoized, meaning that if you call `factorial(5)` multiple times, it will only compute the value once and return the cached result for subsequent calls.

## Step 4: Testing the Memoization

You can test the memoization by calling the function multiple times and observing the performance improvement. Here’s a simple test:

```dart
void main() {
  final realFlutter = RealFlutter();
  
  print(realFlutter.factorial(5)); // Computes and caches the result
  print(realFlutter.factorial(5)); // Returns cached result
}
```

This will demonstrate how the memoized function works, providing the same result without recalculating.

With these steps, you are now ready to integrate the memoized package into your Flutter applications effectively!

# Complete Example of Using the Memoized Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:memoized/memoized.dart';

class RealFlutter {
  // A memoized function to calculate the factorial of a number
  final factorial = memoize((int n) {
    // Base case for recursion
    if (n <= 1) return 1;
    // Recursive case
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
  });
}

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Memoized Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Memoized Function Example'),
        ),
        body: MemoizedExample(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MemoizedExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MemoizedExampleState createState() => _MemoizedExampleState();
}

class _MemoizedExampleState extends State<MemoizedExample> {
  final RealFlutter realFlutter = RealFlutter();
  int _input = 0;
  int _result = 1;

  void _calculateFactorial() {
    // Call the memoized factorial function
    setState(() {
      _result = realFlutter.factorial(_input);
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        TextField(
          decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter a number'),
          keyboardType: TextInputType.number,
          onChanged: (value) {
            _input = int.tryParse(value) ?? 0; // Parse input to integer
          },
        ),
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _calculateFactorial,
          child: Text('Calculate Factorial'),
        ),
        Text('Factorial of $_input is $_result'),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The MemoizedExample widget is created, which manages the state for input and result.
// 4. The user enters a number in the TextField, which updates the _input variable.
// 5. When the button is pressed, _calculateFactorial is called, which uses the memoized factorial function.
// 6. The result is displayed on the screen, showing the factorial of the input number.
// 7. If the same input is entered again, the cached result is returned, demonstrating the efficiency of memoization.
