# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using lcd_number_text

## Installation
To use the `lcd_number_text` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  lcd_number_text: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No specific configurations are required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your application requires any specific capabilities. However, for basic usage of `lcd_number_text`, no additional configurations are necessary.

## Using the Package
To use the `lcd_number_text` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:lcd_number_text/lcd_number_text.dart';
```

You can then use the `LcdNumberText` widget in your widget tree. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
LcdNumberText(
  value: 1234, // The number to display
  color: Colors.green, // The color of the text
  size: 100.0, // The size of the text
  animationDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 500), // Animation duration for number change
)
```

This widget will display the number `1234` in a green LCD style with a size of `100.0` and an animation duration of `500 milliseconds` when the number changes.

# Complete Example of lcd_number_text

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:lcd_number_text/lcd_number_text.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  int _currentValue = 0; // Variable to hold the current number

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('LCD Number Text Example'), // App title
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying the LCD number text
              LcdNumberText(
                value: _currentValue, // Current value to display
                color: Colors.green, // Text color
                size: 100.0, // Text size
                animationDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 500), // Animation duration
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between widgets
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _incrementValue, // Increment value on button press
                child: Text('Increment'), // Button text
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Method to increment the current value
  void _incrementValue() {
    setState(() {
      _currentValue++; // Increase the current value by 1
    });
  }
}
```

// The above code creates a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the lcd_number_text package.
// 
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatefulWidget that maintains the current value to be displayed.
// 3. In the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, an LcdNumberText widget is used to display the current value, which is initially set to 0.
// 5. An ElevatedButton is provided to increment the displayed number when pressed.
// 6. The _incrementValue method updates the state, causing the LcdNumberText widget to animate and display the new value.
// 
// This example showcases how to integrate the lcd_number_text package into a Flutter application, allowing for dynamic updates to the displayed number with a stylish LCD effect.
