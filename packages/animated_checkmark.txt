# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Animated Checkmark

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the **animated_checkmark** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  animated_checkmark: ^1.0.0
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have the package installed, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the animated checkmark.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_checkmark/animated_checkmark.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Animated Checkmark Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: AnimatedCheckmark(
            size: 100.0, // Size of the checkmark
            duration: Duration(milliseconds: 500), // Animation duration
            color: Colors.green, // Color of the checkmark
            onComplete: () {
              // Action to perform after animation completes
              print('Checkmark animation completed!');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays an animated checkmark in the center of the screen. The checkmark will animate for 500 milliseconds and will be green in color.

# Complete Example of Animated Checkmark

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_checkmark/animated_checkmark.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Animated Checkmark Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: AnimatedCheckmark(
            size: 100.0, // Set the size of the checkmark
            duration: Duration(milliseconds: 500), // Set the duration of the animation
            color: Colors.green, // Set the color of the checkmark
            onComplete: () {
              // This callback is triggered when the animation completes
              print('Checkmark animation completed!'); // Log message for debugging
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Animated Checkmark Example'.
// 4. In the body of the Scaffold, we center the AnimatedCheckmark widget.
// 5. The AnimatedCheckmark widget is configured with a size of 100.0, a duration of 500 milliseconds, and a green color.
// 6. When the animation completes, the onComplete callback is triggered, logging a message to the console.
// 7. The animated checkmark provides visual feedback to the user, enhancing the user experience.
