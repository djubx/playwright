# Tutorial: Setting Up sign_in_with_apple_js

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `sign_in_with_apple_js` package and explain how to use it in your Flutter web application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the `sign_in_with_apple_js` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  sign_in_with_apple_js: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Configure Your Apple Developer Account
1. **Create an App ID**: Go to your Apple Developer account and create an App ID for your application.
2. **Enable Sign In with Apple**: In the App ID settings, enable the "Sign In with Apple" capability.
3. **Create a Service ID**: This is required for web applications. Make sure to configure the redirect URL to point to your web app.

## Step 3: Implementing Sign In with Apple
Now, let's implement the sign-in functionality in your Flutter web application.

### Example Code
You will need to create a button that triggers the sign-in process. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sign_in_with_apple_js/sign_in_with_apple_js.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Sign In with Apple Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Trigger the sign-in process
              final result = await SignInWithAppleJS.signIn();
              // Handle the result
              if (result != null) {
                // Successfully signed in
                print('User ID: ${result.userId}');
                print('Email: ${result.email}');
              } else {
                // Sign-in failed
                print('Sign-in failed');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Sign In with Apple'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Testing
- Run your Flutter web application and click the "Sign In with Apple" button.
- Follow the prompts to sign in with your Apple ID.

# Complete Example of Sign In with Apple JS

Here is a complete example of a Flutter web application that uses the `sign_in_with_apple_js` package to implement Apple Sign In.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sign_in_with_apple_js/sign_in_with_apple_js.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Sign In with Apple Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Trigger the sign-in process
              final result = await SignInWithAppleJS.signIn();
              // Handle the result
              if (result != null) {
                // Successfully signed in
                print('User ID: ${result.userId}'); // Print user ID
                print('Email: ${result.email}'); // Print email
              } else {
                // Sign-in failed
                print('Sign-in failed'); // Print failure message
              }
            },
            child: Text('Sign In with Apple'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a simple UI.
// 3. An ElevatedButton is displayed in the center of the screen.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the sign-in process is triggered using SignInWithAppleJS.signIn().
// 5. If the sign-in is successful, the user's ID and email are printed to the console.
// 6. If the sign-in fails, a failure message is printed to the console.
```
