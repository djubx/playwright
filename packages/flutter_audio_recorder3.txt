# flutter_audio_recorder3: Setup and Usage Tutorial

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_audio_recorder3` package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_audio_recorder3` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_audio_recorder3: ^0.3.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open `AndroidManifest.xml` located in `android/app/src/main/` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
   ```

2. **Minimum SDK Version**: Ensure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open `Info.plist` located in `ios/Runner/` and add the following keys:

   ```xml
   <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your microphone to record audio.</string>
   <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your photo library to save recordings.</string>
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your Flutter application.

1. **Import the Package**:

   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter_audio_recorder3/flutter_audio_recorder3.dart';
   ```

2. **Initialize the Recorder**:

   You can create a method to initialize the recorder and start recording audio.

3. **Start and Stop Recording**:

   Use the methods provided by the package to start and stop recording.

4. **Handle Recorded Files**:

   After stopping the recording, you can access the recorded audio file for playback or sharing.

By following these steps, you can successfully integrate audio recording functionality into your Flutter application using the `flutter_audio_recorder3` package.

# Complete Example of flutter_audio_recorder3

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_audio_recorder3/flutter_audio_recorder3.dart';
import 'dart:io';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  FlutterAudioRecorder3? _recorder;
  bool _isRecording = false;
  String _recordingPath = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the recorder
    _initializeRecorder();
  }

  Future<void> _initializeRecorder() async {
    // Set the path for the recording file
    String path = '/${DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch}.wav';
    _recordingPath = path;

    // Create a new instance of FlutterAudioRecorder3
    _recorder = FlutterAudioRecorder3(path, audioFormat: AudioFormat.WAV);
    await _recorder!.initialized; // Initialize the recorder
  }

  Future<void> _startRecording() async {
    // Start recording audio
    await _recorder!.start();
    setState(() {
      _isRecording = true; // Update the recording state
    });
  }

  Future<void> _stopRecording() async {
    // Stop the recording
    await _recorder!.stop();
    setState(() {
      _isRecording = false; // Update the recording state
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Audio Recorder Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              Text(_isRecording ? 'Recording...' : 'Press to Record'),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _isRecording ? _stopRecording : _startRecording,
                child: Text(_isRecording ? 'Stop' : 'Start'),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              Text('Recording saved at: $_recordingPath'),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and initializes the FlutterAudioRecorder3 instance.
// 2. The user can press the button to start or stop recording.
// 3. When recording starts, the UI updates to reflect the recording state.
// 4. The recorded audio file is saved to the specified path.
// 5. The user can see the path of the saved recording on the screen.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application that allows users to record audio. The application initializes the audio recorder, provides buttons to start and stop recording, and displays the path of the saved recording. 

### Summary of Application Flow
- The application initializes the audio recorder when it starts.
- The user can start recording by pressing the "Start" button, which changes to "Stop" while recording.
- Once the recording is stopped, the path of the recorded audio file is displayed on the screen.
- This simple flow demonstrates the core functionality of the `flutter_audio_recorder3` package, allowing for easy integration of audio recording features in Flutter applications.
