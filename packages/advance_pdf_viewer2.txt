# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Advance PDF Viewer 2

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `advance_pdf_viewer2` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  advance_pdf_viewer2: ^2.0.0
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    compileSdkVersion 31 // or latest version
    ...
}

dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'com.github.barteksc:android-pdf-viewer:3.2.0-beta.1' // Add this line
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file to allow file access. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to select PDF files.</string>
<key>NSDocumentsFolderUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your documents to select PDF files.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to display a PDF file.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:advance_pdf_viewer2/advance_pdf_viewer2.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  PDFDocument? document;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    loadPDF();
  }

  // Load the PDF document from assets
  Future<void> loadPDF() async {
    document = await PDFDocument.fromAsset('assets/sample.pdf');
    setState(() {});
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('PDF Viewer Example'),
      ),
      body: document == null
          ? Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator())
          : PDFViewer(
              document: document!,
              scrollDirection: Axis.vertical,
              lazyLoad: false,
            ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we load a PDF document from the assets folder and display it using the `PDFViewer` widget. The app shows a loading indicator while the document is being loaded.

# Complete Example of Advance PDF Viewer 2

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:advance_pdf_viewer2/advance_pdf_viewer2.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  PDFDocument? document; // Variable to hold the PDF document

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    loadPDF(); // Load the PDF document when the app starts
  }

  // Function to load the PDF document from assets
  Future<void> loadPDF() async {
    document = await PDFDocument.fromAsset('assets/sample.pdf'); // Load PDF from assets
    setState(() {}); // Update the state to refresh the UI
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('PDF Viewer Example'), // Title of the app
      ),
      body: document == null // Check if the document is loaded
          ? Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator()) // Show loading indicator if not loaded
          : PDFViewer(
              document: document!, // Pass the loaded document to the viewer
              scrollDirection: Axis.vertical, // Set scroll direction
              lazyLoad: false, // Disable lazy loading for immediate rendering
            ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the initState method, loadPDF() is called to load the PDF document from the assets.
// 3. The loadPDF() function uses PDFDocument.fromAsset to load the PDF file and updates the state.
// 4. In the build method, it checks if the document is null. If it is, a CircularProgressIndicator is displayed.
// 5. Once the document is loaded, the PDFViewer widget is displayed, showing the PDF content.
// 6. The user can scroll through the PDF document vertically.
```
