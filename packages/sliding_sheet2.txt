# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Sliding Sheet 2

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **sliding_sheet2** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  sliding_sheet2: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Basic Setup

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to set the platform version in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Sliding Sheet

To use the sliding sheet in your application, you can create a simple button that triggers the sliding sheet when pressed. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sliding_sheet2/sliding_sheet2.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Sliding Sheet Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              showSlidingBottomSheet(context, builder: (context) {
                return SlidingSheet(
                  elevation: 16,
                  builder: (context, controller, offset) {
                    return Container(
                      height: 300,
                      color: Colors.white,
                      child: Center(child: Text('Hello from the sliding sheet!')),
                    );
                  },
                );
              });
            },
            child: Text('Show Sliding Sheet'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **MaterialApp**: The main widget that wraps the entire application.
- **Scaffold**: Provides the basic structure for the app, including an AppBar and body.
- **ElevatedButton**: A button that, when pressed, triggers the sliding sheet.
- **showSlidingBottomSheet**: A function that displays the sliding sheet when the button is pressed.
- **SlidingSheet**: The widget that represents the sliding sheet, where you can customize its content.

With these steps, you can easily integrate the **sliding_sheet2** package into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Sliding Sheet 2

```dart

import 'package:sliding_sheet2/sliding_sheet2.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Sliding Sheet Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Show the sliding sheet when the button is pressed
              showSlidingBottomSheet(context, builder: (context) {
                return SlidingSheet(
                  elevation: 16, // Set the elevation for shadow effect
                  builder: (context, controller, offset) {
                    // Build the content of the sliding sheet
                    return Container(
                      height: 300, // Set the height of the sliding sheet
                      color: Colors.white, // Background color of the sheet
                      child: Column(
                        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
                        children: [
                          Text('Hello from the sliding sheet!', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24)),
                          SizedBox(height: 20),
                          ElevatedButton(
                            onPressed: () {
                              // Close the sliding sheet when this button is pressed
                              Navigator.of(context).pop();
                            },
                            child: Text('Close'),
                          ),
                        ],
                      ),
                    );
                  },
                );
              });
            },
            child: Text('Show Sliding Sheet'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an ElevatedButton is displayed at the center of the screen.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the showSlidingBottomSheet function is called.
// 5. This function creates a SlidingSheet with a specified elevation and a builder for its content.
// 6. The content of the sliding sheet includes a greeting message and a button to close the sheet.
// 7. Pressing the close button pops the sliding sheet off the navigation stack, returning to the main screen.
