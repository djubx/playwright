# Tutorial: Setting Up the Emoji Picker

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `emoji_picker_flutter` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `emoji_picker_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  emoji_picker_flutter: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install Packages

Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable the `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` in your `Info.plist` file if you plan to allow users to select emojis from their photo library:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to select emojis.</string>
```

## Step 4: Using the Emoji Picker

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the emoji picker in a chat interface.

# Complete Example: Implementing Emoji Picker in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:emoji_picker_flutter/emoji_picker_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Emoji Picker Example',
      home: EmojiPickerExample(),
    );
  }
}

class EmojiPickerExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _EmojiPickerExampleState createState() => _EmojiPickerExampleState();
}

class _EmojiPickerExampleState extends State<EmojiPickerExample> {
  // TextEditingController to manage the input field
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController();
  // Boolean to control the visibility of the emoji picker
  bool _isEmojiPickerVisible = false;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Emoji Picker Example'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Displaying the text input field
          Expanded(
            child: Padding(
              padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
              child: TextField(
                controller: _controller,
                decoration: InputDecoration(
                  hintText: 'Type a message...',
                  suffixIcon: IconButton(
                    icon: Icon(Icons.emoji_emotions),
                    onPressed: () {
                      // Toggle the visibility of the emoji picker
                      setState(() {
                        _isEmojiPickerVisible = !_isEmojiPickerVisible;
                      });
                    },
                  ),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ),
          // Displaying the emoji picker if visible
          if (_isEmojiPickerVisible)
            SizedBox(
              height: 250,
              child: EmojiPicker(
                onEmojiSelected: (category, emoji) {
                  // Append the selected emoji to the text field
                  _controller.text += emoji.emoji;
                },
              ),
            ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation

// The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` widget.
// The `RealFlutter` widget sets up a MaterialApp with a title and a home page.
// The `EmojiPickerExample` widget is a stateful widget that manages the emoji picker functionality.
// Inside the `build` method, we create a `TextField` for user input and an icon button to toggle the emoji picker.
// When the emoji icon is pressed, the `_isEmojiPickerVisible` boolean is toggled, showing or hiding the emoji picker.
// If the emoji picker is visible, it is displayed below the text field.
// The `EmojiPicker` widget listens for emoji selection and appends the selected emoji to the text field's text.
// This allows users to easily insert emojis into their messages, enhancing the chat experience.
