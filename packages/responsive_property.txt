# Responsive Property Flutter Package

The `responsive_property` package is a powerful tool designed to help Flutter developers create responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations. This package simplifies the process of making UI components responsive by allowing developers to define properties that automatically adjust based on the device's dimensions.

## When to Use This Package
- When building applications that need to support multiple screen sizes, such as tablets and smartphones.
- When you want to maintain a consistent user experience across different devices without manually calculating dimensions.
- When you need to create adaptive layouts that change based on orientation (portrait vs. landscape).

## Key Features
- **Responsive Sizing**: Automatically adjusts sizes based on screen dimensions.
- **Orientation Awareness**: Changes properties based on the device's orientation.
- **Ease of Use**: Simple API that integrates seamlessly with existing Flutter widgets.
- **Customizable**: Allows developers to define their own breakpoints for responsiveness.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Responsive Property Package

## Installation
To use the `responsive_property` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  responsive_property: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
The `responsive_property` package works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms. There are no additional configurations required for either platform. However, ensure that your Flutter SDK is up to date to avoid compatibility issues.

## Basic Usage
To use the `responsive_property` package, you will typically wrap your widgets with the `ResponsiveProperty` widget. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:responsive_property/responsive_property.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Responsive Property Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ResponsiveProperty(
            width: 0.5, // 50% of the screen width
            height: 0.3, // 30% of the screen height
            child: Container(
              color: Colors.blue,
              child: Center(child: Text('Responsive Box')),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `ResponsiveProperty` widget takes a width and height as a fraction of the screen size, making it easy to create responsive layouts.

# Complete Example of Responsive Property Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:responsive_property/responsive_property.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Responsive Property Example')),
        body: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Using ResponsiveProperty to create a responsive container
            ResponsiveProperty(
              width: 0.8, // 80% of the screen width
              height: 0.4, // 40% of the screen height
              child: Container(
                color: Colors.red,
                child: Center(child: Text('Responsive Red Box')),
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between boxes
            // Another responsive container
            ResponsiveProperty(
              width: 0.6, // 60% of the screen width
              height: 0.2, // 20% of the screen height
              child: Container(
                color: Colors.green,
                child: Center(child: Text('Responsive Green Box')),
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The MaterialApp widget is created, providing the overall structure of the app.
// 3. A Scaffold widget is used to create the basic visual layout, including an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body contains a Column widget that arranges its children vertically.
// 5. Two ResponsiveProperty widgets are used to create responsive containers.
// 6. The first container takes up 80% of the screen width and 40% of the height, colored red.
// 7. A SizedBox is added for spacing between the two containers.
// 8. The second container takes up 60% of the screen width and 20% of the height, colored green.
// 9. The text inside each container is centered, providing a clear visual representation of responsiveness.
