# Setting Up and Using the `zsdk` Package

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `zsdk` package and demonstrate how to use its features effectively.

## Installation

To install the `zsdk` package, add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  zsdk: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Setup

### Android

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

3. Add any necessary permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml` if required by the package.

### iOS

1. Open your `ios/Podfile`.
2. Ensure the platform is set to at least iOS 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

3. Run `pod install` in the `ios` directory to update your CocoaPods dependencies.

## Basic Usage

To use the `zsdk` package, import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:zsdk/zsdk.dart';
```

Initialize the main class `RealFlutter` in your application:

```dart
void main() {
  RealFlutter.initialize();
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:zsdk/zsdk.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the RealFlutter class from the zsdk package
  RealFlutter.initialize();
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Build the main application widget
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'ZSdk Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  String _status = 'Initializing...';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Call a method from RealFlutter to perform an action
    RealFlutter.performAction().then((result) {
      // Update the UI based on the result of the action
      setState(() {
        _status = result ? 'Action Successful' : 'Action Failed';
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Build the UI of the home page
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('ZSdk Home Page'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          _status,
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application starts by initializing the RealFlutter class.
// The main widget, MyApp, is built, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// MyHomePage is the home screen, which initializes a stateful widget.
// In initState, a method from RealFlutter is called to perform an action.
// The result of this action updates the UI, displaying whether it was successful or not.
// The build method constructs the UI, showing the status message in the center of the screen.
