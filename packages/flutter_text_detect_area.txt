```
### Step 3: Initialize the Package

Initialize the package by calling the `init` method:
```dart
await FlutterTextDetectArea.init();
```
### Step 4: Load the Image

Load the image you want to detect text areas in:
```dart
final image = await ImagePicker().getImage(source: ImageSource.gallery);
```
### Step 5: Detect Text Areas

Detect text areas in the image using the `detectTextAreas` method:
```dart
final textAreas = await FlutterTextDetectArea.detectTextAreas(image.path);
```
### Step 6: Process the Results

```dart
textAreas.forEach((textArea) {
  print('Text Area: ${textArea.rect}');
});
```
### Platform-Specific Details

* Android: Make sure to add the following line to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

// The app starts by loading the main widget, MyApp.
// MyApp builds the MaterialApp with the title and theme.
// The home page is MyHomePage, which is a stateful widget.
// MyHomePage has two buttons: Load Image and Detect Text Areas.
// When the Load Image button is pressed, the _loadImage method is called.
// This method uses the ImagePicker to load an image from the gallery.
// The image path is then stored in the _imagePath variable.
// When the Detect Text Areas button is pressed, the _detectTextAreas method is called.
// This method uses the FlutterTextDetectArea package to detect text areas in the image.
// The detected text areas are then printed to the console.

// The app flow is as follows:
// 1. The user loads an image using the Load Image button.
// 2. The image path is stored in the _imagePath variable.
// 3. The user presses the Detect Text Areas button.
// 4. The _detectTextAreas method is called, which detects text areas in the image.
// 5. The detected text areas are printed to the console.
