# Tutorial: Setting Up the Worldtime Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **worldtime** package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **worldtime** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  worldtime: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to access the internet. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following line inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to configure your app to allow network requests. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to fetch and display the current time for a specific location.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:worldtime/worldtime.dart';
```

2. Create an instance of the `WorldTime` class and fetch the time:

```dart
WorldTime instance = WorldTime(location: 'Berlin', flag: 'germany.png', url: 'Europe/Berlin');
await instance.getTime();
```

3. Access the time and display it in your UI.

This is a basic overview of how to set up and use the **worldtime** package in your Flutter application. You can explore more features and customize it according to your needs.

# Complete Example of Using the Worldtime Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:worldtime/worldtime.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'World Time App',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  String time = 'Loading...'; // Variable to hold the time

  // Function to get the time
  void getTime() async {
    // Create an instance of WorldTime
    WorldTime instance = WorldTime(location: 'Berlin', flag: 'germany.png', url: 'Europe/Berlin');
    
    // Fetch the time
    await instance.getTime();
    
    // Update the state with the fetched time
    setState(() {
      time = instance.time; // Set the time variable to the fetched time
    });
  }

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    getTime(); // Call the getTime function when the widget initializes
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('World Time'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          time, // Display the time
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 48),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. HomeScreen is a stateful widget that manages the time display.
// 4. The getTime function creates a WorldTime instance for Berlin and fetches the current time.
// 5. The fetched time is stored in the time variable and displayed in the UI.
// 6. The initState method calls getTime when the HomeScreen widget is initialized, ensuring the time is fetched as soon as the app starts.
```

In this blog, we have covered the **worldtime** Flutter package, including its description, setup tutorial, and a complete example. The application flow is straightforward: it initializes the app, fetches the current time for a specified location, and displays it to the user. This package is a valuable addition to any Flutter developer's toolkit, especially for applications that require time zone management.
