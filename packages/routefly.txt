# Routefly Flutter Package

The **Routefly** package is a powerful routing solution for Flutter applications that simplifies navigation and enhances the user experience. It provides a flexible and intuitive way to manage routes, making it easier to handle complex navigation scenarios.

## When to Use Routefly

You should consider using Routefly when:
- Your application has multiple screens and complex navigation flows.
- You need to pass data between routes easily.
- You want to implement deep linking or nested navigation.
- You require a simple way to manage route transitions and animations.

## Features of Routefly

- **Declarative Routing**: Define routes in a clear and concise manner.
- **Dynamic Route Management**: Easily add, remove, or modify routes at runtime.
- **Data Passing**: Simplified data passing between routes.
- **Custom Transitions**: Support for custom animations during route transitions.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Routefly

## Step 1: Adding Routefly to Your Project

To get started with Routefly, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  routefly: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Configuring for Android and iOS

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions for internet access if your app requires it. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` file to allow arbitrary loads if you are using HTTP URLs. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using Routefly in Your Application

Now that you have set up Routefly, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement routing with Routefly.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:routefly/routefly.dart';
```

2. Define your routes using the `Routefly` class:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Routefly(
      routes: {
        '/': (context) => HomeScreen(),
        '/details': (context) => DetailsScreen(),
      },
    );
  }
}
```

3. Create your screens:

```dart
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate to the details screen
            Routefly.navigateTo(context, '/details');
          },
          child: Text('Go to Details'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DetailsScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Details')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('This is the details screen.'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

4. Run your application:

```bash
flutter run
```

Now you have a basic application using Routefly for navigation!

# Complete Example of Routefly in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:routefly/routefly.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Routefly Example',
      home: RealFlutter(), // Main routing class
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Routefly(
      routes: {
        '/': (context) => HomeScreen(), // Home route
        '/details': (context) => DetailsScreen(), // Details route
      },
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate to the details screen
            Routefly.navigateTo(context, '/details');
          },
          child: Text('Go to Details'), // Button to navigate
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DetailsScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Details')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('This is the details screen.'), // Display details
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the MyApp class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is the main routing class that defines the routes.
// 3. The HomeScreen is displayed first, with a button to navigate to the DetailsScreen.
// 4. When the button is pressed, Routefly's navigateTo method is called, which changes the route to '/details'.
// 5. The DetailsScreen is then displayed, showing the relevant information.
```
