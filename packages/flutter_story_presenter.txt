# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_story_presenter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_story_presenter` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_story_presenter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_story_presenter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_story_presenter).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file, especially if you are using media from the device. Add the following keys:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to display stories.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to capture photos for stories.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple story presenter. Below is a basic example of how to implement the `flutter_story_presenter` in your Flutter application.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_story_presenter/flutter_story_presenter.dart';
```

2. Create a simple widget to display stories:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Story Presenter Example')),
        body: StoryPresenter(
          stories: [
            StoryItem(
              media: 'https://example.com/image1.jpg',
              duration: Duration(seconds: 5),
            ),
            StoryItem(
              media: 'https://example.com/video1.mp4',
              duration: Duration(seconds: 10),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Run your application:

```bash
flutter run
```

This will launch your Flutter application with a simple story presenter that displays an image and a video.

# Complete Example of flutter_story_presenter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_story_presenter/flutter_story_presenter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Story Presenter Example')),
        body: StoryPresenter(
          stories: [
            // Adding the first story item with an image
            StoryItem(
              media: 'https://example.com/image1.jpg', // URL of the image
              duration: Duration(seconds: 5), // Duration to display the image
            ),
            // Adding the second story item with a video
            StoryItem(
              media: 'https://example.com/video1.mp4', // URL of the video
              duration: Duration(seconds: 10), // Duration to display the video
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is a StoryPresenter widget that takes a list of StoryItem objects.
// 5. Each StoryItem represents a piece of content (image or video) to be displayed.
// 6. The StoryPresenter handles the display and navigation of the stories automatically.
// 7. Users can swipe through the stories, and each story will automatically progress based on the specified duration.
```

In summary, the `flutter_story_presenter` package provides a straightforward way to implement story-like interfaces in Flutter applications. The example above demonstrates how to set up the package, configure it for both Android and iOS, and create a simple story presenter with images and videos. The application flow is designed to be intuitive, allowing users to engage with content seamlessly.
