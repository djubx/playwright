# Setting Up Fluid Kit
=====================

To use Fluid Kit in your Flutter project, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add the Fluid Kit Package to Your Project

Add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  fluid-kit: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Fluid Kit Package

Import the Fluid Kit package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:fluid-kit/fluid-kit.dart';
```

### Step 3: Use Fluid Kit Widgets

Use the Fluid Kit widgets to create your responsive and adaptive user interface. For example:

```dart
FluidContainer(
  child: FluidText(
    'Hello, World!',
    textStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
  ),
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details

*   Android: No additional configuration is required for Android.
*   iOS: To use Fluid Kit on iOS, you need to add the following lines to your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
  <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
  <true/>
</dict>
```

### Optimizations

To optimize the performance of your application, make sure to use the `FluidContainer` widget as the root widget of your application. This will enable the Fluid Kit layout management system.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fluid-kit/fluid-kit.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a FluidContainer widget as the root widget
    return FluidContainer(
      // Set the title of the application
      title: 'Real Flutter',
      // Set the theme of the application
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      // Create a home page for the application
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a FluidText widget to display the title of the page
    return FluidText(
      'Home Page',
      // Set the text style of the title
      textStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the application.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created as the root widget of the application.
// 3. The FluidContainer widget is created as the child of the RealFlutter widget.
// 4. The title and theme of the application are set.
// 5. The home page of the application is created using the HomePage widget.
// 6. The FluidText widget is created to display the title of the page.
// 7. The text style of the title is set.
// 8. The application is displayed to the user.

// In summary, the code flows as follows:
// RealFlutter -> FluidContainer -> HomePage -> FluidText
