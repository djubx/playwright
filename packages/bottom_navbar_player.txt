# Complete Example of `bottom_navbar_player`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bottom_navbar_player/bottom_navbar_player.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Bottom Navbar Player Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  // Current index of the selected tab
  int _currentIndex = 0;

  // List of pages to navigate to
  final List<Widget> _pages = [
    Center(child: Text('Home')),
    Center(child: Text('Search')),
    Center(child: Text('Library')),
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Bottom Navbar Player Example'),
      ),
      body: _pages[_currentIndex], // Display the selected page
      bottomNavigationBar: BottomNavBarPlayer(
        currentIndex: _currentIndex, // Current index of the nav bar
        onTap: (index) {
          setState(() {
            _currentIndex = index; // Update the current index
          });
        },
        items: [
          BottomNavBarItem(
            icon: Icons.home,
            label: 'Home',
          ),
          BottomNavBarItem(
            icon: Icons.search,
            label: 'Search',
          ),
          BottomNavBarItem(
            icon: Icons.library_music,
            label: 'Library',
          ),
        ],
        // Media player controls can be added here
        player: PlayerControls(), // Placeholder for player controls
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The PlayerControls widget can be customized to include play, pause, and other media controls.
// This example focuses on the navigation aspect, but you can integrate your media player here.

```

// The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` widget.
// The `RealFlutter` widget sets up a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// The `HomeScreen` widget maintains the state of the current index for the bottom navigation bar.
// It contains a list of pages that correspond to each tab in the navigation bar.
// The `Scaffold` widget provides the structure, including an AppBar and a body that displays the selected page.
// The `BottomNavBarPlayer` widget is used for the bottom navigation bar, where the current index and tap handler are defined.
// When a tab is tapped, the current index is updated, and the corresponding page is displayed.
// The `PlayerControls` widget is a placeholder for media playback controls, which can be customized as needed.
