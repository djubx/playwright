// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user clicks the "Login" button, which calls the `_login` method.
// 2. The `_login` method initializes the AAD B2C webview by calling the `init` method.
// 3. The `_login` method authenticates the user by calling the `login` method.
// 4. The `login` method renders the AAD B2C login page in a webview.
// 5. The user enters their credentials and submits the form.
// 6. The AAD B2C login page redirects to the redirect URI, which is handled by the `login` method.
// 7. The `login` method returns the authentication result, which is handled by the `_login` method.
// 8. The `_login` method checks the authentication result and prints a message to the console indicating whether the user is authenticated or not.
