# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `quds_popup_menu`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `quds_popup_menu` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  quds_popup_menu: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:quds_popup_menu/quds_popup_menu.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Popup Menu

You can now use the `QudsPopupMenu` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
QudsPopupMenu(
  items: [
    QudsPopupMenuItem(
      title: 'Option 1',
      onTap: () {
        // Handle Option 1
      },
    ),
    QudsPopupMenuItem(
      title: 'Option 2',
      onTap: () {
        // Handle Option 2
      },
    ),
  ],
  child: Icon(Icons.more_vert), // The widget that triggers the popup
);
```

This setup will create a popup menu that appears when the user taps on the icon.

# Complete Example of Using `quds_popup_menu`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:quds_popup_menu/quds_popup_menu.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Quds Popup Menu Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Quds Popup Menu Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: QudsPopupMenu(
            items: [
              QudsPopupMenuItem(
                title: 'Option 1',
                onTap: () {
                  // Handle Option 1
                  print('Option 1 selected');
                },
              ),
              QudsPopupMenuItem(
                title: 'Option 2',
                onTap: () {
                  // Handle Option 2
                  print('Option 2 selected');
                },
              ),
              QudsPopupMenuItem(
                title: 'Option 3',
                onTap: () {
                  // Handle Option 3
                  print('Option 3 selected');
                },
              ),
            ],
            child: Icon(Icons.more_vert, size: 40), // Trigger icon
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Quds Popup Menu Example".
// 4. In the body of the Scaffold, a QudsPopupMenu is created with three options.
// 5. Each option has an onTap callback that prints a message to the console when selected.
// 6. The popup menu is triggered by tapping the icon displayed in the center of the screen.
