# Tutorial: Setting Up Teledart in Your Flutter Project

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the Teledart package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the Teledart package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  teledart: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Configure for Android

For Android, you need to ensure that your app has internet permissions. Open the `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permission:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

## Step 3: Configure for iOS

For iOS, you need to add the following permissions in your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

This allows your app to make network requests.

## Step 4: Initialize Teledart

In your main Dart file, you will need to initialize the Teledart package. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:teledart/teledart.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Teledart Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Create a Bot Instance

You can create a bot instance using your bot token, which you can obtain from the BotFather on Telegram:

```dart
final teledart = TeleDart('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN', Event());
```

## Step 6: Handle Incoming Messages

You can set up a listener to handle incoming messages:

```dart
teledart.onMessage().listen((message) {
  teledart.sendMessage(message.chat.id, 'Hello, ${message.from.firstName}!');
});
```

This code listens for incoming messages and responds with a greeting.

## Step 7: Run Your Application

Now, you can run your application using `flutter run`. Your bot should be up and running, ready to interact with users.

With these steps, you have successfully set up the Teledart package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Teledart in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:teledart/teledart.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// Main application widget
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Teledart Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

// Home screen widget
class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  late TeleDart teledart;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the Teledart instance with your bot token
    teledart = TeleDart('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN', Event());

    // Listen for incoming messages
    teledart.onMessage().listen((message) {
      // Respond to the user with a greeting
      teledart.sendMessage(message.chat.id, 'Hello, ${message.from.firstName}!');
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Teledart Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Your bot is running!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application flow explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds the MaterialApp and sets HomeScreen as the home widget.
// 3. HomeScreen initializes the Teledart instance with the bot token.
// 4. It listens for incoming messages and responds with a greeting.
// 5. The UI displays a simple message indicating that the bot is running.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this complete example, we have created a simple Flutter application that integrates the Teledart package. The application initializes a Telegram bot and listens for incoming messages, responding with a personalized greeting. 

### Summary of Application Flow
- The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `MyApp` widget.
- The `MyApp` widget builds a `MaterialApp` and sets the `HomeScreen` as the main screen.
- In the `HomeScreen`, we initialize the Teledart instance with the bot token and set up a listener for incoming messages.
- When a message is received, the bot responds with a greeting to the user.
- The UI displays a simple message indicating that the bot is running, providing a clear indication of the bot's status.

This structure provides a comprehensive overview of the Teledart package, guiding users through setup and implementation while demonstrating its capabilities in a practical example.
