# Plural Noun Flutter Package

The **plural_noun** Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to help developers manage pluralization in their applications. It provides a simple and efficient way to handle plural forms of nouns based on the count, making it particularly useful for applications that require localization or dynamic text generation.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the **plural_noun** package in scenarios such as:
- **Localization**: When your app needs to support multiple languages and requires accurate pluralization rules.
- **Dynamic Content**: When displaying counts of items (e.g., "1 apple" vs. "2 apples") where the text needs to change based on the quantity.
- **User Interfaces**: In applications where user feedback is provided based on counts, such as notifications or messages.

## Features

- **Simple API**: The package offers an easy-to-use API for pluralization.
- **Language Support**: It supports multiple languages and their respective pluralization rules.
- **Custom Rules**: Developers can define custom pluralization rules if needed.

With these features, the **plural_noun** package simplifies the process of managing plural forms in Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Plural Noun Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **plural_noun** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  plural_noun: ^1.0.0
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:plural_noun/plural_noun.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

### Basic Usage

You can use the package to get the plural form of a noun based on a count. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
String pluralForm = PluralNoun.pluralize('apple', 2); // Returns 'apples'
String singularForm = PluralNoun.pluralize('apple', 1); // Returns 'apple'
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

#### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Optimizations

To optimize the performance of your app, consider caching the results of pluralization if the same counts are used frequently. This can reduce the overhead of repeated calculations.

With these steps, you are now ready to use the **plural_noun** package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Using the Plural Noun Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:plural_noun/plural_noun.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Plural Noun Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Plural Noun Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: PluralDisplay(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class PluralDisplay extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Define a count variable
    int count = 3; // You can change this value to test different outputs

    // Get the plural form of 'apple' based on the count
    String pluralForm = PluralNoun.pluralize('apple', count);

    // Return a Text widget displaying the count and plural form
    return Text(
      'You have $count $pluralForm.',
      style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds the PluralDisplay widget.
// 4. The PluralDisplay widget defines a count variable and uses the pluralize method from the plural_noun package to get the correct plural form of 'apple'.
// 5. Finally, it displays the count and the plural form in a Text widget, updating dynamically based on the count value.
```
