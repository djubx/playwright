# Overview of the tex_markdown Flutter Package

The `tex_markdown` package is a powerful tool for rendering LaTeX-style mathematical expressions and Markdown text in Flutter applications. This package is particularly useful for educational apps, scientific applications, or any app that requires the display of complex mathematical formulas alongside regular text.

## When to Use

You should consider using the `tex_markdown` package when:
- You need to display mathematical equations in your Flutter app.
- You want to combine Markdown text formatting with LaTeX rendering.
- Your application targets educational or scientific audiences that require precise mathematical notation.

## Features

- **LaTeX Rendering**: Render LaTeX equations seamlessly within your Flutter widgets.
- **Markdown Support**: Combine Markdown text formatting with LaTeX for rich text display.
- **Customizable**: Easily customize the appearance of rendered text.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on both Android and iOS, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.

With these features, `tex_markdown` provides a robust solution for developers looking to enhance their Flutter applications with advanced text rendering capabilities.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using tex_markdown

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `tex_markdown` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  tex_markdown: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/tex_markdown).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable the use of Swift in your project. Open your `ios/Podfile` and ensure that the platform is set to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:tex_markdown/tex_markdown.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the `TexMarkdown` widget to render LaTeX and Markdown text. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
TexMarkdown(
  data: r"""
  # Hello, World!
  
  Here is a mathematical expression: \( E = mc^2 \)
  """,
)
```

This widget will render the Markdown text and the LaTeX expression correctly in your Flutter app.

## Step 5: Customization

You can customize the appearance of the rendered text by using various properties of the `TexMarkdown` widget, such as `style`, `textAlign`, and more.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the `tex_markdown` package in your Flutter application effectively.

# Complete Example of Using tex_markdown

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tex_markdown/tex_markdown.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Tex Markdown Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Tex Markdown Example'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: TexMarkdown(
            data: r"""
            # Welcome to RealFlutter!

            This is a simple example of using the `tex_markdown` package.

            Here is a famous equation: \( E = mc^2 \)

            ## Features
            - LaTeX rendering
            - Markdown support
            - Customizable appearance
            """,
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18), // Customizing text size
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body uses Padding to provide space around the TexMarkdown widget.
// 5. TexMarkdown is used to render both Markdown and LaTeX content.
// 6. The data property contains the text to be rendered, including a LaTeX equation and Markdown formatting.
// 7. The style property customizes the text appearance, setting the font size to 18.
// 8. The app displays a simple interface with formatted text and a mathematical equation.
