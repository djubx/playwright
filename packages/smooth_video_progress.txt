# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Smooth Video Progress

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **smooth_video_progress** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the **smooth_video_progress** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  smooth_video_progress: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install Packages

Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0' # Ensure this is set to at least 10.0
```

## Step 4: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:smooth_video_progress/smooth_video_progress.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Smooth Video Progress Widget

You can now use the `SmoothVideoProgress` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
SmoothVideoProgress(
  duration: Duration(seconds: 120), // Total video duration
  position: Duration(seconds: 30), // Current playback position
  onSeek: (position) {
    // Handle seek action
    print("Seek to: $position");
  },
)
```

This widget will display a progress bar that users can interact with to seek through the video.

# Complete Example of Smooth Video Progress

Below is a complete example of a Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the **smooth_video_progress** package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:smooth_video_progress/smooth_video_progress.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Smooth Video Progress Example',
      home: VideoPlayerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class VideoPlayerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _VideoPlayerScreenState createState() => _VideoPlayerScreenState();
}

class _VideoPlayerScreenState extends State<VideoPlayerScreen> {
  Duration totalDuration = Duration(seconds: 120); // Total video duration
  Duration currentPosition = Duration(seconds: 0); // Current playback position

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Video Player'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: [
          // Display the smooth video progress indicator
          SmoothVideoProgress(
            duration: totalDuration,
            position: currentPosition,
            onSeek: (position) {
              // Update the current position when the user seeks
              setState(() {
                currentPosition = position;
              });
              print("Seek to: $position");
            },
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20),
          // Button to simulate video playback
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Simulate video playback by updating the current position
              setState(() {
                currentPosition = Duration(seconds: currentPosition.inSeconds + 10);
                if (currentPosition > totalDuration) {
                  currentPosition = totalDuration; // Cap to total duration
                }
              });
            },
            child: Text('Play 10 Seconds'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (VideoPlayerScreen).
// 3. VideoPlayerScreen maintains the state of the video playback, including total duration and current position.
// 4. The SmoothVideoProgress widget displays the progress of the video, allowing users to seek through it.
// 5. When the user seeks, the onSeek callback updates the current position.
// 6. The "Play 10 Seconds" button simulates video playback by advancing the current position by 10 seconds each time it is pressed.
// 7. The UI updates to reflect the new current position, and the progress indicator moves accordingly.
```
