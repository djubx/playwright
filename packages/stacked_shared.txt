Here's a detailed technical blog on the "stacked_shared" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Stacked Shared Flutter Package

The **stacked_shared** package is a powerful tool designed to simplify state management in Flutter applications. It builds upon the popular Stacked architecture, providing a shared state management solution that allows developers to manage their application's state efficiently and effectively. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple widgets need to access and modify shared data without the need for complex boilerplate code.

## When to Use Stacked Shared

You should consider using the **stacked_shared** package in the following scenarios:

- **Shared State Management**: When you have multiple widgets that need to access and modify the same state.
- **Simplified Code Structure**: If you want to reduce boilerplate code associated with state management.
- **Reactive Programming**: When you want to leverage reactive programming principles to update your UI automatically when the state changes.

## Key Features

- **Easy Integration**: The package can be easily integrated into existing Flutter applications.
- **Reactive State Management**: Automatically updates the UI when the state changes.
- **Support for Multiple Platforms**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Built-in Dependency Injection**: Simplifies the management of dependencies within your application.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Stacked Shared

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **stacked_shared** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  stacked_shared: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/stacked_shared).

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter and the package:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

To use the **stacked_shared** package, you need to create a model class that extends `BaseModel`. This model will hold the shared state. Hereâ€™s an example:

```dart
import 'package:stacked_shared/stacked_shared.dart';

class RealFlutterModel extends BaseModel {
  String _data = "Initial Data";

  String get data => _data;

  void updateData(String newData) {
    _data = newData;
    notifyListeners(); // Notify listeners to update the UI
  }
}
```

Next, you can create a view that uses this model:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:stacked/stacked.dart';

class RealFlutterView extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ViewModelBuilder<RealFlutterModel>.reactive(
      viewModelBuilder: () => RealFlutterModel(),
      builder: (context, model, child) {
        return Scaffold(
          appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Stacked Shared Example")),
          body: Center(
            child: Column(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              children: [
                Text(model.data), // Display the shared data
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () {
                    model.updateData("Updated Data"); // Update the data
                  },
                  child: Text("Update Data"),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Running the Application

Now that you have set up the model and view, you can run your application using:

```bash
flutter run
```

This will launch your Flutter application, and you should see the initial data displayed. Clicking the "Update Data" button will change the displayed data to "Updated Data".

# Complete Example of Stacked Shared

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:stacked/stacked.dart';
import 'package:stacked_shared/stacked_shared.dart';

// Model class that extends BaseModel to hold shared state
class RealFlutterModel extends BaseModel {
  String _data = "Initial Data"; // Initial state

  String get data => _data; // Getter for data

  // Method to update the data and notify listeners
  void updateData(String newData) {
    _data = newData; // Update the state
    notifyListeners(); // Notify listeners to rebuild the UI
  }
}

// Main application widget
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Stacked Shared Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutterView(), // Set the home to the view
    );
  }
}

// View that uses the RealFlutterModel
class RealFlutterView extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ViewModelBuilder<RealFlutterModel>.reactive(
      viewModelBuilder: () => RealFlutterModel(), // Create an instance of the model
      builder: (context, model, child) {
        return Scaffold(
          appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Stacked Shared Example")), // App bar title
          body: Center(
            child: Column(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              children: [
                Text(model.data), // Display the current data
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () {
                    model.updateData("Updated Data"); // Update the data on button press
                  },
                  child: Text("Update Data"), // Button text
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application flow explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp and specifies RealFlutterView as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutterView uses ViewModelBuilder to create an instance of RealFlutterModel.
// 4. The current data from the model is displayed in a Text widget.
// 5. When the "Update Data" button is pressed, the updateData method is called, changing the state.
// 6. The notifyListeners() method triggers a rebuild, updating the displayed data automatically.
```

In summary, the **stacked_shared** package provides a streamlined approach to managing shared state in Flutter applications. By following the steps outlined in this blog, you can easily integrate the package into your projects, set up your models and views, and create responsive applications that react to state changes efficiently.
