# Setting Up and Using the Simple Icons Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up the `simple_icons` package in a Flutter project and demonstrate how to use it effectively.

## Setup Process

### Step 1: Add Dependency

First, add the `simple_icons` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  simple_icons: ^5.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package to access its functionalities:

```dart
import 'package:simple_icons/simple_icons.dart';
```

### Step 3: Using Icons

To use an icon, simply call it from the `SimpleIcons` class. For example, to use the Facebook icon:

```dart
Icon(SimpleIcons.facebook)
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

No additional configuration is required for Android. Ensure your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to support all Flutter features.

### iOS

For iOS, ensure your `Info.plist` is configured to support the necessary permissions if your app uses network resources to fetch additional data related to the icons.

## Optimizations

- **Icon Size**: Use the `size` property to adjust the icon size according to your design.
- **Color Customization**: Use the `color` property to match the icon color with your app's theme.

# Complete Example: Flutter Main File

Below is a complete example of a Flutter application using the `simple_icons` package. This example demonstrates how to display a selection of brand icons in a simple user interface.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simple_icons/simple_icons.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Simple Icons Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: IconDisplayScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class IconDisplayScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Brand Icons'),
      ),
      body: GridView.count(
        crossAxisCount: 3, // Display icons in a grid with 3 columns
        children: <Widget>[
          Icon(SimpleIcons.facebook, size: 50.0, color: Colors.blue),
          Icon(SimpleIcons.twitter, size: 50.0, color: Colors.lightBlue),
          Icon(SimpleIcons.instagram, size: 50.0, color: Colors.purple),
          Icon(SimpleIcons.linkedin, size: 50.0, color: Colors.blueAccent),
          Icon(SimpleIcons.github, size: 50.0, color: Colors.black),
          Icon(SimpleIcons.google, size: 50.0, color: Colors.red),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The `main` function initializes the app by calling `runApp` with `RealFlutter` as the root widget.
// 2. `RealFlutter` is a stateless widget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home screen of the app is `IconDisplayScreen`, which is another stateless widget.
// 4. `IconDisplayScreen` builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a GridView.
// 5. The GridView displays a collection of brand icons using the `SimpleIcons` class.
// 6. Each icon is customized with a specific size and color to match the brand's identity.
// 7. The app displays these icons in a grid format, allowing users to view multiple icons at once.
