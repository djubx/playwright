# Tutorial
==========

## Setup
--------

To use the `web_pointer` package, add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  web_pointer: ^1.0.0
```
Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Details
---------------------------

### Android

To use the `web_pointer` package on Android, you need to add the following permission to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```
### iOS

To use the `web_pointer` package on iOS, you need to add the following permission to your `Info.plist` file:
```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
  <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
  <true/>
</dict>
```
## Using the Package
-------------------

To use the `web_pointer` package, import it in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:web_pointer/web_pointer.dart';
```
Then, create a `WebPointer` instance and attach it to a `Widget`:
```dart
WebPointer _webPointer = WebPointer();

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
    body: Center(
      child: _webPointer.attach(
        child: Container(
          width: 100,
          height: 100,
          color: Colors.red,
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

<-- START_MAIN -->

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:web_pointer/web_pointer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Web Pointer Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  WebPointer _webPointer = WebPointer();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Web Pointer Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: _webPointer.attach(
          child: Container(
            width: 100,
            height: 100,
            color: Colors.red,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and the `MyApp` widget is created.
// 2. The `MyApp` widget builds the `MyHomePage` widget.
// 3. The `MyHomePage` widget creates a `WebPointer` instance and attaches it to a `Container` widget.
// 4. The `WebPointer` instance listens for pointer events on the `Container` widget.
// 5. When a pointer event occurs, the `WebPointer` instance calls the `onPointerEvent` callback.
// 6. The `onPointerEvent` callback is not implemented in this example, but it would typically handle the pointer event.
// 7. The app continues to run and listen for pointer events until it is closed.

// Summary: This code creates a simple Flutter app that demonstrates the use of the `web_pointer` package. The app creates a `WebPointer` instance and attaches it to a `Container` widget, which listens for pointer events. The app does not implement any callback to handle the pointer events, but it demonstrates the basic usage of the `web_pointer` package.
