# flutter_hooks_async_redux: A Comprehensive Overview

The `flutter_hooks_async_redux` package is a powerful tool that combines the benefits of Redux state management with the simplicity of Flutter Hooks. This package is particularly useful for developers looking to manage asynchronous operations in their Flutter applications while maintaining a clean and efficient state management architecture.

## When to Use This Package
You should consider using `flutter_hooks_async_redux` when:
- You need to manage complex state in your Flutter application.
- Your application requires handling asynchronous data fetching or operations.
- You want to leverage the benefits of both Redux and Flutter Hooks for a more declarative and functional approach to state management.

## Key Features
- **Redux Integration**: Seamlessly integrates Redux for state management, allowing you to manage your app's state in a predictable way.
- **Hooks Support**: Utilizes Flutter Hooks to simplify the management of lifecycle events and stateful logic.
- **Asynchronous Actions**: Provides a straightforward way to handle asynchronous actions, making it easier to fetch data from APIs or perform other async operations.
- **Type Safety**: Ensures type safety with Dart, reducing runtime errors and improving code quality.

Overall, `flutter_hooks_async_redux` is an excellent choice for developers looking to build scalable and maintainable Flutter applications with robust state management capabilities.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_hooks_async_redux

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_hooks_async_redux` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Package to Your Project
To get started, you need to add the `flutter_hooks_async_redux` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_hooks: ^0.18.0
  flutter_hooks_async_redux: ^0.1.0
  redux: ^5.0.0
```

After adding the dependencies, run `flutter pub get` to install them.

## Step 2: Setting Up Redux Store
You need to create a Redux store to manage your application's state. Here’s a simple setup:

```dart
import 'package:redux/redux.dart';

// Define your app state
class AppState {
  final String data;

  AppState({this.data = ''});
}

// Define your actions
class FetchDataAction {}

// Define your reducer
AppState appReducer(AppState state, dynamic action) {
  if (action is FetchDataAction) {
    return AppState(data: 'Fetched Data');
  }
  return state;
}

// Create the store
final store = Store<AppState>(appReducer, initialState: AppState());
```

## Step 3: Using flutter_hooks_async_redux in Your App
Now, you can use the package in your Flutter application. Here’s how to set it up in your main file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_hooks/flutter_hooks.dart';
import 'package:flutter_hooks_async_redux/flutter_hooks_async_redux.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return StoreProvider<AppState>(
      store: store,
      child: MaterialApp(
        home: RealFlutter(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Platform-Specific Details
- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21.
- **iOS**: Make sure to enable the necessary permissions in your `Info.plist` if you are fetching data from the internet.

## Step 4: Implementing the RealFlutter Widget
Now, let’s implement the `RealFlutter` widget that will use the Redux store and hooks:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends HookWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final state = useStoreState<AppState>();
    final dispatch = useStoreDispatch();

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Hooks Async Redux')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text(state.data),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                dispatch(FetchDataAction());
              },
              child: Text('Fetch Data'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this widget:
- We use `useStoreState` to access the current state from the Redux store.
- We use `useStoreDispatch` to dispatch actions to the store.

Now you have a basic setup for using `flutter_hooks_async_redux` in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of flutter_hooks_async_redux

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_hooks/flutter_hooks.dart';
import 'package:flutter_hooks_async_redux/flutter_hooks_async_redux.dart';
import 'package:redux/redux.dart';

// Define your app state
class AppState {
  final String data;

  AppState({this.data = ''});
}

// Define your actions
class FetchDataAction {}

// Define your reducer
AppState appReducer(AppState state, dynamic action) {
  if (action is FetchDataAction) {
    return AppState(data: 'Fetched Data');
  }
  return state;
}

// Create the store
final store = Store<AppState>(appReducer, initialState: AppState());

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return StoreProvider<AppState>(
      store: store,
      child: MaterialApp(
        home: RealFlutter(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends HookWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Access the current state from the Redux store
    final state = useStoreState<AppState>();
    // Get the dispatch function to send actions to the store
    final dispatch = useStoreDispatch();

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Hooks Async Redux')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the current data from the state
            Text(state.data),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Dispatch the FetchDataAction when the button is pressed
                dispatch(FetchDataAction());
              },
              child: Text('Fetch Data'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs MyApp.
// 2. MyApp sets up the Redux store and provides it to the widget tree.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget is built, which uses hooks to access the Redux state and dispatch actions.
// 4. When the button is pressed, it dispatches the FetchDataAction.
// 5. The reducer processes the action and updates the state with 'Fetched Data'.
// 6. The UI automatically rebuilds to reflect the new state, displaying the fetched data.
