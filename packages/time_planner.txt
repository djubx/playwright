# Time Planner Flutter Package

The **time_planner** package is a powerful tool for managing and scheduling tasks in Flutter applications. It provides a user-friendly interface for creating, editing, and displaying time-based events, making it ideal for applications that require scheduling functionalities, such as calendars, to-do lists, or event planners.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the **time_planner** package when:
- You need to implement a scheduling feature in your app.
- You want to allow users to create and manage events or tasks.
- You require a customizable and easy-to-use interface for time management.

## Features

- **Event Creation**: Easily create events with start and end times.
- **Event Editing**: Modify existing events with a simple interface.
- **Customizable UI**: Tailor the appearance of the planner to fit your app's design.
- **Recurring Events**: Support for events that repeat on a regular basis.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Time Planner Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **time_planner** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  time_planner: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if your app requires access to the user's calendar. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSCalendarsUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your calendar to manage events.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a basic time planner interface.

# Complete Example of Time Planner

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:time_planner/time_planner.dart'; // Import the time_planner package

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Time Planner Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(), // Set the home to the RealFlutter widget
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Initialize a list to hold events
  List<Event> events = [];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Time Planner'),
        actions: [
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.add),
            onPressed: _addEvent, // Call the method to add an event
          ),
        ],
      ),
      body: TimePlanner(
        events: events, // Pass the list of events to the TimePlanner
        onEventTap: (event) {
          // Handle event tap
          _editEvent(event);
        },
      ),
    );
  }

  // Method to add a new event
  void _addEvent() {
    // Show a dialog to create a new event
    showDialog(
      context: context,
      builder: (context) {
        return AlertDialog(
          title: Text('Add Event'),
          content: EventForm(
            onSave: (event) {
              setState(() {
                events.add(event); // Add the new event to the list
              });
              Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
            },
          ),
        );
      },
    );
  }

  // Method to edit an existing event
  void _editEvent(Event event) {
    // Show a dialog to edit the selected event
    showDialog(
      context: context,
      builder: (context) {
        return AlertDialog(
          title: Text('Edit Event'),
          content: EventForm(
            event: event, // Pass the existing event to the form
            onSave: (updatedEvent) {
              setState(() {
                // Update the event in the list
                int index = events.indexOf(event);
                events[index] = updatedEvent;
              });
              Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
            },
          ),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

// EventForm widget to handle event creation and editing
class EventForm extends StatelessWidget {
  final Event? event;
  final Function(Event) onSave;

  EventForm({this.event, required this.onSave});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Form fields for event details
    return Column(
      children: [
        TextField(
          decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Event Title'),
          controller: TextEditingController(text: event?.title),
        ),
        // Additional fields for date and time can be added here
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Create a new event or update the existing one
            Event newEvent = Event(
              title: 'New Event', // Replace with actual input
              startTime: DateTime.now(),
              endTime: DateTime.now().add(Duration(hours: 1)),
            );
            onSave(newEvent); // Call the onSave function
          },
          child: Text(event == null ? 'Add Event' : 'Update Event'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application using the time_planner package. 
// It consists of a main widget (MyApp) that sets up the application and a stateful widget (RealFlutter) 
// that manages the events. The app has an AppBar with an add button to create new events. 
// When the button is pressed, a dialog appears allowing the user to input event details. 
// The events are displayed using the TimePlanner widget, and tapping on an event opens a dialog 
// to edit the event details. The EventForm widget handles both creating and updating events, 
// making it reusable for both functionalities. 

// Overall, this application flow allows users to manage their events efficiently, 
// providing a straightforward interface for adding and editing events in a time planner.
