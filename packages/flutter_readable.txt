# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Flutter Readable Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `flutter_readable` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_readable: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0' # Ensure this is set to at least 10.0
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_readable/flutter_readable.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Readable Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ReadableText(
            'This is an example of using the flutter_readable package to enhance text readability.',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, color: Colors.black),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that uses the `ReadableText` widget from the `flutter_readable` package to display a piece of text with enhanced readability.

# Complete Example of Flutter Readable Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_readable/flutter_readable.dart';

// Main class of the application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Readable Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Readable Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          // Using ReadableText to display text
          child: ReadableText(
            'This is an example of using the flutter_readable package to enhance text readability.',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, color: Colors.black),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp().
// 2. The RealFlutter class is instantiated, which builds the MaterialApp widget.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold widget that provides the basic structure of the app.
// 4. An AppBar is created with the title 'Flutter Readable Example'.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget, which centers its child.
// 6. The ReadableText widget is used to display a string of text with enhanced readability.
// 7. The text style is defined with a font size of 20 and a black color, making it easy to read.
```
