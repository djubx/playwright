# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Interactive Media Ads Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the **interactive_media_ads** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  interactive_media_ads: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the necessary permissions and metadata for the ad service:

```xml
<manifest>
    <application>
        <!-- Add this inside the <application> tag -->
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.google.android.gms.ads.APPLICATION_ID"
            android:value="YOUR_ADMOB_APP_ID"/>
    </application>
</manifest>
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to configure the ad service:

```xml
<key>GADApplicationIdentifier</key>
<string>YOUR_ADMOB_APP_ID</string>
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage
Now that you have configured your project, you can start using the package in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to display an interactive media ad.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:interactive_media_ads/interactive_media_ads.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Interactive Media Ads Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: InteractiveAd(
            adUnitId: 'YOUR_AD_UNIT_ID',
            onAdLoaded: () {
              print('Ad Loaded');
            },
            onAdFailedToLoad: (error) {
              print('Ad Failed to Load: $error');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, replace `YOUR_AD_UNIT_ID` with your actual ad unit ID.

# Complete Example of Interactive Media Ads

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:interactive_media_ads/interactive_media_ads.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Interactive Media Ads Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: InteractiveAd(
            adUnitId: 'YOUR_AD_UNIT_ID', // Replace with your ad unit ID
            onAdLoaded: () {
              // Callback when the ad is successfully loaded
              print('Ad Loaded');
            },
            onAdFailedToLoad: (error) {
              // Callback when the ad fails to load
              print('Ad Failed to Load: $error');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Start the app with the RealFlutter widget
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, an InteractiveAd is created with the specified ad unit ID.
// 4. The onAdLoaded callback is triggered when the ad is successfully loaded, printing a message to the console.
// 5. If the ad fails to load, the onAdFailedToLoad callback is triggered, printing the error message to the console.
// 6. This setup allows for easy integration of interactive media ads into your Flutter application, enhancing user engagement.
