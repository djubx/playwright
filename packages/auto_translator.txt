# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Auto Translator Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **auto_translator** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  auto_translator: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to allow network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Here’s a simple example of how to implement the translation feature.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:auto_translator/auto_translator.dart';
```

2. Initialize the translator and use it to translate text:

```dart
void main() async {
  // Initialize the translator
  final translator = RealFlutter();

  // Translate text
  String translatedText = await translator.translate("Hello, World!", to: "es");
  print(translatedText); // Outputs: "Hola, Mundo!"
}
```

This basic setup allows you to translate text from one language to another using the **auto_translator** package. You can expand upon this by integrating it into your UI and handling user input dynamically.

# Complete Example of Using the Auto Translator Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:auto_translator/auto_translator.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Auto Translator Demo',
      home: TranslatorScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class TranslatorScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _TranslatorScreenState createState() => _TranslatorScreenState();
}

class _TranslatorScreenState extends State<TranslatorScreen> {
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController();
  String _translatedText = '';

  // Initialize the translator
  final translator = RealFlutter();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Auto Translator'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              controller: _controller,
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Enter text to translate',
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _translateText,
              child: Text('Translate'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(
              'Translated Text: $_translatedText',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to handle translation
  Future<void> _translateText() async {
    // Get the text from the controller
    String textToTranslate = _controller.text;

    // Translate the text to Spanish
    String translated = await translator.translate(textToTranslate, to: 'es');

    // Update the state with the translated text
    setState(() {
      _translatedText = translated;
    });
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The TranslatorScreen widget is displayed, containing a TextField for user input.
// 3. When the user enters text and presses the "Translate" button, the _translateText function is called.
// 4. This function retrieves the text from the TextField, uses the RealFlutter translator to translate it to Spanish, and updates the UI with the translated text.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, the application allows users to input text, which is then translated into Spanish when the button is pressed. The flow of the application is straightforward, with clear separation of concerns between the UI and the translation logic. The comments within the code provide a step-by-step explanation of how the application operates, making it easy for developers to understand and extend the functionality as needed.
