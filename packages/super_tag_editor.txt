# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Super Tag Editor

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **super_tag_editor** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  super_tag_editor: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/super_tag_editor).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` if your app requires internet access or other features. However, the **super_tag_editor** package does not require any specific permissions.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the **super_tag_editor** in your app.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:super_tag_editor/super_tag_editor.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Super Tag Editor Demo',
      home: TagEditorDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class TagEditorDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _TagEditorDemoState createState() => _TagEditorDemoState();
}

class _TagEditorDemoState extends State<TagEditorDemo> {
  // List to hold the tags
  List<String> _tags = [];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Super Tag Editor Example'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            // SuperTagEditor widget for tag input
            SuperTagEditor(
              tags: _tags,
              onTagChanged: (tags) {
                // Update the state with the new list of tags
                setState(() {
                  _tags = tags;
                });
              },
              // Customizing the appearance of the tag editor
              tagBuilder: (context, tag) {
                return Chip(
                  label: Text(tag),
                  onDeleted: () {
                    // Remove the tag when the delete icon is pressed
                    setState(() {
                      _tags.remove(tag);
                    });
                  },
                );
              },
              // Placeholder text for the input field
              placeholder: 'Add a tag',
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Displaying the current tags
            Text('Current Tags: ${_tags.join(', ')}'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
```
// The main function initializes the app and sets up the MaterialApp.
// The RealFlutter class is the root widget of the application.
// The TagEditorDemo class is a StatefulWidget that manages the state of the tags.
// Inside the build method, we create a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// The SuperTagEditor widget is used to allow users to input tags.
// The onTagChanged callback updates the state whenever tags are added or removed.
// The tagBuilder customizes how each tag is displayed, using a Chip widget.
// The placeholder property provides a hint for the input field.
// Finally, we display the current tags below the tag editor.
