# Overview of the server_universe Flutter Package

The `server_universe` package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who need to interact with server-side applications seamlessly. It provides a robust framework for managing server requests, handling responses, and integrating with various backend services. This package is particularly useful for applications that require real-time data updates, such as chat applications, live dashboards, or any app that relies on server communication.

## When to Use `server_universe`

- **Real-time Applications**: If your app needs to display live data or updates from a server.
- **RESTful API Integration**: When you need to connect to REST APIs for data fetching and manipulation.
- **WebSocket Communication**: For applications that require persistent connections to a server for real-time data exchange.

## Key Features

- **Easy Integration**: Simplifies the process of connecting to various server types, including REST and WebSocket.
- **Data Handling**: Provides utilities for parsing and managing data received from the server.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in mechanisms to handle errors gracefully during server communication.
- **Customizable**: Allows developers to customize request headers, timeouts, and other parameters.

Overall, `server_universe` is an essential package for Flutter developers looking to enhance their applications with server-side capabilities.

# Setting Up and Using the server_universe Package

## Installation

To get started with the `server_universe` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  server_universe: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` to allow network requests. Add the following lines to your `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the `server_universe` package to make a GET request:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:server_universe/server_universe.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Server Universe Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Create an instance of the ServerUniverse class
              final server = ServerUniverse();

              // Make a GET request
              final response = await server.get('https://api.example.com/data');

              // Handle the response
              if (response.isSuccessful) {
                print('Data: ${response.data}');
              } else {
                print('Error: ${response.error}');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Fetch Data'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to set up a basic Flutter application that fetches data from a server using the `server_universe` package. The button triggers a GET request, and the response is printed to the console.

# Complete Example of server_universe in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:server_universe/server_universe.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Server Universe Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Create an instance of the ServerUniverse class
              final server = ServerUniverse();

              // Make a GET request to the specified URL
              final response = await server.get('https://api.example.com/data');

              // Check if the request was successful
              if (response.isSuccessful) {
                // If successful, print the data received from the server
                print('Data: ${response.data}');
              } else {
                // If there was an error, print the error message
                print('Error: ${response.error}');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Fetch Data'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which builds a MaterialApp.
// 2. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. The Center widget contains an ElevatedButton that, when pressed, triggers an asynchronous function.
// 4. This function creates an instance of the ServerUniverse class to handle server communication.
// 5. A GET request is made to the specified URL.
// 6. The response is checked for success; if successful, the data is printed to the console.
// 7. If there is an error, the error message is printed instead.
// 8. This simple flow allows for easy interaction with server data, demonstrating the core functionality of the server_universe package.
