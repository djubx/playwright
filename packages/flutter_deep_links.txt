# Setting Up and Using flutter_deep_links

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_deep_links` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Installation

To get started, add the `flutter_deep_links` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_deep_links: ^latest_version
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add an intent filter to the `<activity>` tag to handle deep links:

```xml
<activity
    android:name=".MainActivity"
    android:launchMode="singleTask">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
        <data android:scheme="your_scheme" android:host="your_host" />
    </intent-filter>
</activity>
```

Replace `your_scheme` and `your_host` with your desired values.

### iOS Configuration
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following configuration to support deep links:

```xml
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
    <dict>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
        <array>
            <string>your_scheme</string>
        </array>
    </dict>
</array>
```

Again, replace `your_scheme` with your desired scheme.

## Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. The following example demonstrates how to handle incoming deep links.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_deep_links/flutter_deep_links.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _deepLinkMessage = "No deep link received yet.";

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the deep link listener
    _initDeepLinkListener();
  }

  void _initDeepLinkListener() {
    // Listen for incoming deep links
    FlutterDeepLinks.onLinkReceived.listen((String link) {
      // Update the message based on the received link
      setState(() {
        _deepLinkMessage = "Received deep link: $link";
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Deep Links Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Deep Links Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(_deepLinkMessage), // Display the deep link message
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and the main widget `RealFlutter` is created.
// 2. In the `initState` method, we initialize the deep link listener.
// 3. The listener waits for incoming deep links and updates the state when a link is received.
// 4. When a deep link is received, the message is updated to display the link.
// 5. The updated message is shown in the center of the screen.
