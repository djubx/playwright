# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Colorize Text Avatar

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the `colorize_text_avatar` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  colorize_text_avatar: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to create a colorized text avatar.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:colorize_text_avatar/colorize_text_avatar.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Colorize Text Avatar Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ColorizeTextAvatar(
            text: 'AB', // The text to display in the avatar
            size: 100, // Size of the avatar
            backgroundColors: [Colors.red, Colors.blue, Colors.green], // Background colors
            textColor: Colors.white, // Text color
            shape: BoxShape.circle, // Shape of the avatar
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays a colorized text avatar in the center of the screen.

# Complete Example of Colorize Text Avatar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:colorize_text_avatar/colorize_text_avatar.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Colorize Text Avatar Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Center widget to align the avatar in the middle of the screen
          child: ColorizeTextAvatar(
            text: 'AB', // The text to display in the avatar
            size: 100, // Size of the avatar
            backgroundColors: [Colors.red, Colors.blue, Colors.green], // Background colors
            textColor: Colors.white, // Text color
            shape: BoxShape.circle, // Shape of the avatar
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Entry point of the application
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the Flutter application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the UI.
// 3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// 4. The AppBar displays the title of the application.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 6. The ColorizeTextAvatar widget is used to create an avatar with the text 'AB'.
// 7. The avatar has a size of 100, with a gradient background of red, blue, and green colors.
// 8. The text color is set to white, and the avatar is shaped as a circle.
// 9. Finally, the runApp function is called to launch the application.
```
