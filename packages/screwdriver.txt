# Screwdriver Flutter Package
The Screwdriver Flutter package is a powerful tool for simplifying the development process of Flutter applications. It provides a set of utilities and features that make it easier to manage and optimize your app's performance, security, and overall user experience.

## When to Use Screwdriver
You should consider using Screwdriver in the following scenarios:

* When you need to optimize your app's performance and reduce memory usage.
* When you want to improve your app's security by encrypting sensitive data.
* When you need to simplify your app's development process by automating repetitive tasks.

## Key Features of Screwdriver
Some of the key features of Screwdriver include:

* Performance optimization tools, such as memory leak detection and code optimization.
* Security features, such as data encryption and secure storage.
* Development tools, such as automated testing and debugging.

# Setting Up Screwdriver
To use Screwdriver in your Flutter app, follow these steps:

1. Add the Screwdriver package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  screwdriver: ^1.0.0
```
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.
3. Import the Screwdriver package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:screwdriver/screwdriver.dart';
```
## Platform-Specific Configurations
### Android
To use Screwdriver on Android, you need to add the following configuration to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:
```xml
<application
    ...
    android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"
    ...>
</application>
```
### iOS
To use Screwdriver on iOS, you need to add the following configuration to your `Info.plist` file:
```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```
## Optimizations
To optimize your app's performance, you can use the following Screwdriver features:

* Memory leak detection: `Screwdriver.memoryLeakDetection()`
* Code optimization: `Screwdriver.codeOptimization()`

}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize Screwdriver
    Screwdriver.init();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Real Flutter',

                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Detect memory leaks
                  Screwdriver.memoryLeakDetection();
                },
                child: Text('Detect Memory Leaks'),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Optimize code
                  Screwdriver.codeOptimization();
                },
                child: Text('Optimize Code'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application flow:
// 1. The app initializes Screwdriver in the `initState` method.
// 2. The user clicks the "Detect Memory Leaks" button, which calls the `memoryLeakDetection` method.
// 3. The user clicks the "Optimize Code" button, which calls the `codeOptimization` method.
// 4. The app displays the results of the memory leak detection and code optimization.

// Summary:
// This code demonstrates the use of Screwdriver in a Flutter app. It initializes Screwdriver, detects memory leaks, and optimizes code. The app displays the results of these operations.
