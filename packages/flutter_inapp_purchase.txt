# Tutorial: Setting Up flutter_inapp_purchase

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_inapp_purchase` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

First, add the `flutter_inapp_purchase` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_inapp_purchase: ^3.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BILLING"/>
   ```

2. **Billing Library**: Ensure that your app is using the Google Play Billing Library. You can do this by updating your `build.gradle` file:

   ```groovy
   dependencies {
       implementation 'com.android.billingclient:billing:4.0.0'
   }
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. **In-App Purchase Capability**: Enable the In-App Purchase capability in your Xcode project settings.

## Step 3: Initialize the Package

In your main Dart file, initialize the `flutter_inapp_purchase` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_inapp_purchase/flutter_inapp_purchase.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await FlutterInappPurchase.instance.initialize();
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 4: Implementing In-App Purchases

You can now implement in-app purchases in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to fetch products and handle purchases.

```dart
// Fetch products
List<IAPItem> items = await FlutterInappPurchase.instance.getProducts(['product_id_1', 'product_id_2']);
```

This will retrieve the products you have set up in your app store account.

## Step 5: Handling Purchases

To handle purchases, you can use the following code:

```dart
// Start a purchase
await FlutterInappPurchase.instance.requestPurchase('product_id_1');
```

Make sure to handle the purchase result and any errors that may occur.

# Complete Example of flutter_inapp_purchase

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_inapp_purchase/flutter_inapp_purchase.dart';

void main() async {
  // Ensure Flutter binding is initialized
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  
  // Initialize the In-App Purchase instance
  await FlutterInappPurchase.instance.initialize();
  
  // Run the app
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // List to hold product items
  List<IAPItem> items = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Fetch products when the app starts
    _fetchProducts();
  }

  // Function to fetch products from the store
  Future<void> _fetchProducts() async {
    try {
      // Fetch products using their IDs
      List<IAPItem> fetchedItems = await FlutterInappPurchase.instance.getProducts(['product_id_1', 'product_id_2']);
      setState(() {
        items = fetchedItems; // Update the state with fetched items
      });
    } catch (error) {
      print("Error fetching products: $error");
    }
  }

  // Function to handle purchase
  Future<void> _purchaseProduct(String productId) async {
    try {
      // Request purchase for the selected product
      await FlutterInappPurchase.instance.requestPurchase(productId);
    } catch (error) {
      print("Error purchasing product: $error");
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('In-App Purchase Example')),
        body: ListView.builder(
          itemCount: items.length,
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            return ListTile(
              title: Text(items[index].title), // Display product title
              subtitle: Text(items[index].description), // Display product description
              trailing: Text('\$${items[index].price}'), // Display product price
              onTap: () => _purchaseProduct(items[index].productId), // Handle purchase on tap
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app initializes and sets up the In-App Purchase instance.
// 2. It fetches available products from the store using their IDs.
// 3. The products are displayed in a list format.
// 4. When a user taps on a product, the purchase process is initiated.
// 5. Errors during fetching or purchasing are caught and printed to the console.
```
