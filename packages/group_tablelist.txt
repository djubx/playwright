# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `group_tablelist`

## Installation
To get started with the `group_tablelist` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  group_tablelist: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/group_tablelist).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
Once you have installed the package and configured your project, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a grouped table list.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:group_tablelist/group_tablelist.dart';
```

2. Create a data model for your items:

```dart
class Item {
  final String name;
  final String group;

  Item(this.name, this.group);
}
```

3. Use the `GroupTableList` widget in your UI:

```dart
GroupTableList<Item>(
  items: items, // List of items
  groupBy: (item) => item.group, // Grouping logic
  itemBuilder: (context, item) => ListTile(
    title: Text(item.name),
  ),
);
```

This basic setup will allow you to display a grouped list of items in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of `group_tablelist`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:group_tablelist/group_tablelist.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Group Table List Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Grouped Table List'),
        ),
        body: GroupedListScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class GroupedListScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  // Sample data to display
  final List<Item> items = [
    Item('Apple', 'Fruits'),
    Item('Banana', 'Fruits'),
    Item('Carrot', 'Vegetables'),
    Item('Broccoli', 'Vegetables'),
    Item('Chicken', 'Meat'),
    Item('Beef', 'Meat'),
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return GroupTableList<Item>(
      items: items, // Pass the list of items
      groupBy: (item) => item.group, // Define how to group items
      itemBuilder: (context, item) => ListTile(
        title: Text(item.name), // Display item name
      ),
      groupHeaderBuilder: (context, group) => Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
        child: Text(
          group, // Display group name
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold containing an AppBar and the GroupedListScreen.
// 3. GroupedListScreen contains a list of items categorized into groups (Fruits, Vegetables, Meat).
// 4. The GroupTableList widget is used to display the items, grouping them by the specified criterion.
// 5. Each item is displayed using a ListTile, and group headers are styled for better visibility.
