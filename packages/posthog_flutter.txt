# PostHog Flutter Package

The `posthog_flutter` package is a powerful tool for integrating PostHog analytics into your Flutter applications. PostHog is an open-source product analytics platform that allows developers to track user interactions and behaviors within their applications. This package provides a seamless way to send events, manage user properties, and analyze user behavior directly from your Flutter app.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `posthog_flutter` package when:
- You want to gain insights into user behavior within your Flutter application.
- You need to track specific events, such as button clicks, screen views, or custom actions.
- You want to manage user properties to segment your users for targeted analysis.
- You are looking for an open-source alternative to traditional analytics platforms.

## Features

- **Event Tracking**: Easily track events and user interactions.
- **User Properties**: Set and manage user properties to enhance user segmentation.
- **Session Recording**: Record user sessions to understand user behavior better.
- **Heatmaps**: Visualize user interactions on your app's UI.
- **Integration**: Simple integration with existing Flutter applications.

With these features, the `posthog_flutter` package empowers developers to make data-driven decisions and improve user experiences.

# Tutorial: Setting Up PostHog in Your Flutter App

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `posthog_flutter` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `posthog_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  posthog_flutter: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Configure for Android

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

3. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Configure for iOS

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following lines to allow network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Initialize PostHog

In your main Dart file, initialize PostHog with your API key. This is typically done in the `main()` function:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:posthog_flutter/posthog_flutter.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  
  // Initialize PostHog with your API key
  await PostHogFlutter.init('YOUR_POSTHOG_API_KEY');
  
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 5: Using PostHog

You can now use PostHog to track events and set user properties. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

```dart
// Track an event
PostHogFlutter.capture('Button Clicked', properties: {
  'button_name': 'Sign Up',
});

// Set user properties
PostHogFlutter.identify('user_id_123', properties: {
  'email': 'user@example.com',
  'name': 'John Doe',
});
```

With these steps, you have successfully integrated the `posthog_flutter` package into your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of PostHog in a Flutter App

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:posthog_flutter/posthog_flutter.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  
  // Initialize PostHog with your API key
  await PostHogFlutter.init('YOUR_POSTHOG_API_KEY');
  
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'PostHog Flutter Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('PostHog Flutter Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Track the button click event
            PostHogFlutter.capture('Button Clicked', properties: {
              'button_name': 'Sign Up',
            });
            // Navigate to the next screen
            Navigator.push(
              context,
              MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => SecondScreen()),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Sign Up'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SecondScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Set user properties when navigating to the second screen
    PostHogFlutter.identify('user_id_123', properties: {
      'email': 'user@example.com',
      'name': 'John Doe',
    });

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Second Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to the second screen!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and initializes PostHog with the provided API key.
// 2. The main widget is `RealFlutter`, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. The `HomeScreen` widget displays a button labeled "Sign Up".
// 4. When the button is clicked, an event is tracked using PostHog, and the app navigates to `SecondScreen`.
// 5. In `SecondScreen`, user properties are set to identify the user.
// 6. The user sees a welcome message on the second screen.
```
