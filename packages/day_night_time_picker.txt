# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Day Night Time Picker

In this tutorial, we will walk through the steps to set up the **day_night_time_picker** package in a Flutter application and demonstrate how to use it effectively.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **day_night_time_picker** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  day_night_time_picker: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 3: Using the Day Night Time Picker

Now that the package is set up, you can use it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the **day_night_time_picker** in your app.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:day_night_time_picker/day_night_time_picker.dart';
```

2. Create a stateful widget to manage the time selection:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  TimeOfDay selectedTime = TimeOfDay.now(); // Initialize with the current time

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Day Night Time Picker Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () async {
            // Show the day night time picker
            final TimeOfDay? newTime = await showTimePicker(
              context: context,
              initialTime: selectedTime,
            );
            if (newTime != null) {
              setState(() {
                selectedTime = newTime; // Update the selected time
              });
            }
          },
          child: Text('Select Time: ${selectedTime.format(context)}'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a simple Flutter application with a button that opens the day/night time picker when pressed. The selected time is displayed on the button.

# Complete Example of Day Night Time Picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:day_night_time_picker/day_night_time_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Day Night Time Picker Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(), // Set the home to our main widget
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  TimeOfDay selectedTime = TimeOfDay.now(); // Initialize with the current time

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Day Night Time Picker Example'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () async {
            // Show the day night time picker
            final TimeOfDay? newTime = await showTimePicker(
              context: context,
              initialTime: selectedTime, // Pass the currently selected time
            );
            if (newTime != null) {
              setState(() {
                selectedTime = newTime; // Update the selected time
              });
            }
          },
          child: Text('Select Time: ${selectedTime.format(context)}'), // Display the selected time
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme, and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter is a stateful widget that maintains the selected time.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the day/night time picker is displayed.
// 5. The user can select a new time, which updates the selectedTime variable.
// 6. The button text updates to show the newly selected time.
