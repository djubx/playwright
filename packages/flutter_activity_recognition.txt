# Flutter Activity Recognition Package

The `flutter_activity_recognition` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to integrate activity recognition capabilities into their applications. This package allows you to detect various physical activities such as walking, running, cycling, and more, using the device's sensors. 

## When to Use This Package
You might consider using the `flutter_activity_recognition` package in scenarios such as:
- Fitness applications that track user activities.
- Health monitoring apps that provide insights based on user movement.
- Applications that require context-aware features, adapting to user activities.

## Features
- **Real-time Activity Recognition**: Detects user activities in real-time.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS.
- **Customizable**: Allows developers to define which activities to monitor.
- **Efficient**: Utilizes device sensors effectively to minimize battery consumption.

This package is essential for developers aiming to create interactive and responsive applications that adapt to user behavior based on their physical activities.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_activity_recognition

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_activity_recognition` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the `flutter_activity_recognition` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_activity_recognition: ^<latest_version>
```

Make sure to replace `<latest_version>` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION"/>
```

3. Ensure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 29 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 29
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to request permission for activity recognition:

```xml
<key>NSMotionUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to motion data to recognize activities.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that we have configured the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to initialize the package and listen for activity updates.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_activity_recognition/flutter_activity_recognition.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _activity = 'Unknown';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _startActivityRecognition();
  }

  void _startActivityRecognition() async {
    // Request permission to access activity recognition
    await FlutterActivityRecognition.requestPermissions();

    // Start listening for activity updates
    FlutterActivityRecognition.activityUpdates.listen((activity) {
      setState(() {
        _activity = activity.type.toString(); // Update the activity state
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Activity Recognition')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Current Activity: $_activity'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize the activity recognition in the `initState` method, request permissions, and listen for activity updates. The current activity is displayed in the center of the screen.

# Complete Example of flutter_activity_recognition

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_activity_recognition/flutter_activity_recognition.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _activity = 'Unknown'; // Variable to hold the current activity

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _startActivityRecognition(); // Start activity recognition when the app initializes
  }

  void _startActivityRecognition() async {
    // Request permission to access activity recognition
    await FlutterActivityRecognition.requestPermissions();

    // Start listening for activity updates
    FlutterActivityRecognition.activityUpdates.listen((activity) {
      setState(() {
        _activity = activity.type.toString(); // Update the activity state
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Activity Recognition')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Current Activity: $_activity'), // Display the current activity
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and the RealFlutter widget is created.
// 2. In the initState method, we call _startActivityRecognition to begin the process.
// 3. The _startActivityRecognition method requests permission to access activity recognition data.
// 4. Once permission is granted, we start listening for activity updates.
// 5. When an activity update is received, we update the _activity variable and rebuild the UI to display the current activity.
// 6. The current activity is shown in the center of the screen, updating in real-time as the user changes activities.
