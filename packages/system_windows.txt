# Complete Example of Using the system_windows Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:system_windows/system_windows.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'System Windows Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  // Initialize the window manager
  final WindowManager _windowManager = WindowManager();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Set the window title
    _windowManager.setTitle('My Flutter App');
  }

  // Function to show a notification
  void _showNotification() {
    _windowManager.showNotification(
      title: 'Hello!',
      body: 'This is a notification from your Flutter app.',
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('System Windows Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _showNotification, // Show notification on button press
          child: Text('Show Notification'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is a stateful widget that manages the window using WindowManager.
// 4. In the initState method, the window title is set to 'My Flutter App'.
// 5. The _showNotification method is defined to display a notification when called.
// 6. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a button.
// 7. When the button is pressed, the _showNotification method is triggered, displaying a notification to the user.
```
