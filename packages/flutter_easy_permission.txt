# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_easy_permission

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_easy_permission` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_easy_permission: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_easy_permission).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `AndroidManifest.xml` located in `android/app/src/main/`.
2. Add the necessary permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag. For example, to request camera and location permissions, add:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `Info.plist` located in `ios/Runner/`.
2. Add the required permissions with descriptions. For example:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to take photos.</string>
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your location for better service.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to request permissions:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_easy_permission/flutter_easy_permission.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Permission Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Request camera permission
              var status = await FlutterEasyPermission.requestPermission(Permission.camera);
              if (status.isGranted) {
                // Permission granted
                print('Camera permission granted');
              } else {
                // Permission denied
                print('Camera permission denied');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Request Camera Permission'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, the app requests camera permission. Depending on the user's response, it prints the status to the console.

# Complete Example of flutter_easy_permission

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_easy_permission/flutter_easy_permission.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Permission Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Request camera permission
              var status = await FlutterEasyPermission.requestPermission(Permission.camera);
              if (status.isGranted) {
                // Permission granted
                print('Camera permission granted');
              } else {
                // Permission denied
                print('Camera permission denied');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Request Camera Permission'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which builds a MaterialApp.
// 2. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. The Center widget contains an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the app calls the requestPermission method from the flutter_easy_permission package.
// 5. The app checks if the camera permission is granted or denied and prints the corresponding message to the console.
