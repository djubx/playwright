# Tutorial: Setting Up gma_mediation_unity

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `gma_mediation_unity` package and explain how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

First, add the `gma_mediation_unity` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  gma_mediation_unity: ^latest_version
```

Replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Configure Android

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the necessary permissions and metadata:

```xml
<manifest>
    <application>
        <!-- Add this inside the <application> tag -->
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.google.android.gms.ads.APPLICATION_ID"
            android:value="YOUR_ADMOB_APP_ID"/>
    </application>
</manifest>
```

Replace `YOUR_ADMOB_APP_ID` with your actual AdMob application ID.

2. **Add Unity Ads SDK**: Follow the Unity Ads documentation to integrate the Unity Ads SDK into your Android project.

## Step 3: Configure iOS

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open your `Info.plist` file located in `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>GADApplicationIdentifier</key>
<string>YOUR_ADMOB_APP_ID</string>
```

Replace `YOUR_ADMOB_APP_ID` with your actual AdMob application ID.

2. **Add Unity Ads SDK**: Follow the Unity Ads documentation to integrate the Unity Ads SDK into your iOS project.

## Step 4: Initialize the Package

In your Flutter application, initialize the `gma_mediation_unity` package in the `main.dart` file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gma_mediation_unity/gma_mediation_unity.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the mediation
    GmaMediationUnity.initialize();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('GMA Mediation Unity Example')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Welcome to GMA Mediation Unity!')),
    );
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Load and Show Ads

You can now load and show ads using the package. Refer to the package documentation for specific methods to load and display ads.

By following these steps, you will have successfully set up the `gma_mediation_unity` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of gma_mediation_unity

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gma_mediation_unity/gma_mediation_unity.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  // Variable to hold the ad unit ID
  final String adUnitId = 'YOUR_AD_UNIT_ID';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the mediation
    GmaMediationUnity.initialize();
    // Load an ad
    GmaMediationUnity.loadAd(adUnitId);
  }

  // Method to show the ad
  void showAd() {
    GmaMediationUnity.showAd(adUnitId);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('GMA Mediation Unity Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Welcome to GMA Mediation Unity!'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: showAd,
              child: Text('Show Ad'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds the MaterialApp and sets HomeScreen as the home widget.
// 3. In HomeScreen, we initialize the GmaMediationUnity package in initState().
// 4. We load an ad using the loadAd method with the specified ad unit ID.
// 5. The UI displays a button that, when pressed, calls the showAd method to display the loaded ad.
// 6. The ad will be shown if it has been successfully loaded, allowing users to interact with it.
