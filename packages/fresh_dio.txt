# Fresh Dio: A Comprehensive Guide

The **fresh_dio** package is a powerful Flutter library that enhances the capabilities of the Dio HTTP client by providing a fresh token management system. This package is particularly useful for applications that require secure API calls with token-based authentication, ensuring that tokens are refreshed seamlessly without interrupting the user experience.

## When to Use Fresh Dio

You should consider using the **fresh_dio** package in scenarios where:
- Your application interacts with APIs that require authentication tokens.
- You need to handle token expiration and refresh tokens automatically.
- You want to simplify the management of HTTP requests and responses.

## Key Features
- **Automatic Token Refresh**: Automatically refreshes tokens when they expire, ensuring uninterrupted API access.
- **Customizable Interceptors**: Allows you to define custom interceptors for handling requests and responses.
- **Error Handling**: Provides robust error handling mechanisms for failed requests.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate with existing Dio clients.

With these features, **fresh_dio** makes it easier to manage API calls in Flutter applications, especially those that require secure authentication.

# Setting Up Fresh Dio

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **fresh_dio** package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependencies

First, add the **fresh_dio** and **dio** packages to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dio: ^5.0.0
  fresh_dio: ^0.1.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the packages.

## Step 2: Configure Dio with Fresh Dio

Next, you need to configure Dio to use the **fresh_dio** package. Here’s how to do it:

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `Info.plist` to allow HTTP requests:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Implementing Fresh Dio

Now, let’s implement the **fresh_dio** package in your Flutter application. Below is a basic setup:

```dart
import 'package:dio/dio.dart';
import 'package:fresh_dio/fresh_dio.dart';

class RealFlutter {
  final Dio _dio;
  final FreshDio _freshDio;

  RealFlutter()
      : _dio = Dio(),
        _freshDio = FreshDio(
          dio: _dio,
          tokenRefresher: TokenRefresher(),
        );

  void makeRequest() async {
    try {
      final response = await _freshDio.get('https://api.example.com/data');
      print(response.data);
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error: $e');
    }
  }
}

class TokenRefresher implements FreshTokenRefresher {
  @override
  Future<String> refreshToken(String oldToken) async {
    // Logic to refresh the token
    return 'newToken';
  }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Dio Initialization**: We create an instance of Dio and FreshDio.
2. **Token Refresher**: We implement a `TokenRefresher` class that handles the logic for refreshing tokens.
3. **Making Requests**: The `makeRequest` method demonstrates how to make a GET request using the FreshDio instance.

With this setup, your application is ready to handle token-based authentication seamlessly.

# Complete Example of Fresh Dio in Action

Below is a complete Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the **fresh_dio** package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dio/dio.dart';
import 'package:fresh_dio/fresh_dio.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Fresh Dio Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  final Dio _dio = Dio();
  late final FreshDio _freshDio;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize FreshDio with Dio and TokenRefresher
    _freshDio = FreshDio(
      dio: _dio,
      tokenRefresher: TokenRefresher(),
    );
  }

  // Function to make an API request
  void _fetchData() async {
    try {
      // Making a GET request to the API
      final response = await _freshDio.get('https://api.example.com/data');
      // Displaying the response data
      print(response.data);
    } catch (e) {
      // Handling errors
      print('Error: $e');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Fresh Dio Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _fetchData, // Fetch data on button press
          child: Text('Fetch Data'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// TokenRefresher class to handle token refresh logic
class TokenRefresher implements FreshTokenRefresher {
  @override
  Future<String> refreshToken(String oldToken) async {
    // Logic to refresh the token
    // For example, making a request to refresh the token
    return 'newToken'; // Return the new token
  }
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation

// The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `MyApp` widget.
// `MyApp` sets up a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// The `HomeScreen` widget is a stateful widget that initializes the FreshDio instance in `initState`.
// The `_fetchData` method is called when the button is pressed, which makes a GET request to the specified API.
// If the request is successful, the response data is printed to the console; otherwise, an error message is displayed.
// The `TokenRefresher` class implements the logic for refreshing tokens when they expire, ensuring seamless API access.
