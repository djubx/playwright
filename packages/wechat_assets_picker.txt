# Tutorial: Setting Up WeChat Assets Picker

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the wechat_assets_picker package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  wechat_assets_picker: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/wechat_assets_picker).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    compileSdkVersion 31 // or latest
    ...
}

dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'com.android.support:multidex:1.0.3' // Add this line
}
```

2. In `AndroidManifest.xml`, add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request permission to access the photo library:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to select images and videos.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to save images and videos to your photo library.</string>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that we have set up the package, let's implement a simple asset picker in our Flutter application.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:wechat_assets_picker/wechat_assets_picker.dart';
```

2. Create a function to open the asset picker:

```dart
Future<void> pickAssets() async {
  final List<AssetEntity>? result = await AssetPicker.pickAssets(
    context,
    maxAssets: 9, // Maximum number of assets to select
    requestType: AssetType.all, // Request both images and videos
  );

  if (result != null) {
    // Handle the selected assets
    for (var asset in result) {
      print(asset.id); // Print the asset ID
    }
  }
}
```

3. Call this function from a button or any other widget in your UI.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the wechat_assets_picker package into your Flutter application successfully.

# Complete Example: Flutter Application Using WeChat Assets Picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:wechat_assets_picker/wechat_assets_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'WeChat Assets Picker Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  // Function to pick assets
  Future<void> pickAssets(BuildContext context) async {
    // Open the asset picker
    final List<AssetEntity>? result = await AssetPicker.pickAssets(
      context,
      maxAssets: 9, // Set the maximum number of assets to select
      requestType: AssetType.all, // Allow selection of both images and videos
    );

    // Check if any assets were selected
    if (result != null) {
      // Loop through the selected assets
      for (var asset in result) {
        // Print the asset ID to the console
        print(asset.id);
      }
      // Show a snackbar with the number of selected assets
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('${result.length} assets selected')),
      );
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('WeChat Assets Picker Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () => pickAssets(context), // Call the pickAssets function
          child: Text('Pick Assets'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget contains a button that, when pressed, calls the pickAssets function.
// 4. The pickAssets function opens the asset picker, allowing the user to select up to 9 assets.
// 5. If assets are selected, their IDs are printed to the console, and a snackbar displays the count of selected assets.
```

In this blog, we have covered the wechat_assets_picker package, including its description, setup tutorial, and a complete example. The application flow is straightforward: it initializes the app, presents a button to pick assets, and handles the selection process, providing feedback to the user. This package is a great addition to any Flutter application that requires media selection capabilities.
