# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Animated Rail

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **animated_rail** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **animated_rail** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  animated_rail: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Animated Rail

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple Flutter application that uses the **animated_rail** package.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:animated_rail/animated_rail.dart';
```

2. Create a `RealFlutter` class that extends `StatelessWidget` or `StatefulWidget` depending on your needs.

3. Implement the `AnimatedRail` widget in your build method, specifying the items and their corresponding actions.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the animated rail in your app.

# Complete Example of Animated Rail

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_rail/animated_rail.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to keep track of the selected index
  int _selectedIndex = 0;

  // List of pages to navigate to
  final List<Widget> _pages = [
    HomePage(),
    SettingsPage(),
    ProfilePage(),
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: _pages[_selectedIndex], // Display the selected page
        bottomNavigationBar: AnimatedRail(
          // Define the items in the rail
          items: [
            AnimatedRailItem(
              icon: Icons.home,
              label: 'Home',
              onTap: () => _onItemTapped(0), // Navigate to Home
            ),
            AnimatedRailItem(
              icon: Icons.settings,
              label: 'Settings',
              onTap: () => _onItemTapped(1), // Navigate to Settings
            ),
            AnimatedRailItem(
              icon: Icons.person,
              label: 'Profile',
              onTap: () => _onItemTapped(2), // Navigate to Profile
            ),
          ],
          selectedIndex: _selectedIndex, // Highlight the selected item
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Method to handle item taps
  void _onItemTapped(int index) {
    setState(() {
      _selectedIndex = index; // Update the selected index
    });
  }
}

// Home Page Widget
class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(child: Text('Home Page', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24)));
  }
}

// Settings Page Widget
class SettingsPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(child: Text('Settings Page', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24)));
  }
}

// Profile Page Widget
class ProfilePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(child: Text('Profile Page', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24)));
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains the selected index for the navigation rail.
// 3. The _pages list contains the different pages (Home, Settings, Profile) to navigate to.
// 4. The build method returns a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing the selected page and the AnimatedRail.
// 5. The AnimatedRail widget displays the navigation items, and the selected item is highlighted based on the _selectedIndex.
// 6. When an item is tapped, the _onItemTapped method updates the _selectedIndex, causing the UI to rebuild and display the corresponding page.
```

// The above code demonstrates how to implement the animated rail in a Flutter application. The app consists of three pages: Home, Settings, and Profile. The navigation rail allows users to switch between these pages smoothly. The selected page is displayed based on the user's selection, and the corresponding navigation item is highlighted. The application flow is managed through the `_selectedIndex` variable, which updates whenever a navigation item is tapped, ensuring a responsive and interactive user experience.
