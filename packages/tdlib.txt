# Setting Up the tdlib Flutter Package
=====================================

To use the tdlib Flutter package, you need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your pubspec.yaml File

First, you need to add the tdlib package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. You can do this by adding the following line to the `dependencies` section of your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  tdlib: ^0.1.0
```

### Step 2: Import the Package

Next, you need to import the package in your Dart file. You can do this by adding the following line to the top of your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:tdlib/tdlib.dart';
```

### Step 3: Initialize the Package

After importing the package, you need to initialize it. You can do this by creating a new instance of the `Tdlib` class and calling the `initialize` method:

```dart
Tdlib tdlib = Tdlib();
await tdlib.initialize();
```

### Platform-Specific Details

The tdlib package has some platform-specific details that you need to be aware of:

*   **Android:** On Android, you need to add the following lines to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

    ```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
```

*   **iOS:** On iOS, you need to add the following lines to your `Info.plist` file:

    ```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

### Required Configurations and Optimizations

The tdlib package requires some configurations and optimizations to work properly:

*   **API ID and Hash:** You need to provide your API ID and hash to the `Tdlib` instance. You can do this by calling the `setApiId` and `setApiHash` methods:

    ```dart
tdlib.setApiId('YOUR_API_ID');
tdlib.setApiHash('YOUR_API_HASH');
```

*   **Database Path:** You need to provide a database path to the `Tdlib` instance. You can do this by calling the `setDatabasePath` method:

    ```dart
tdlib.setDatabasePath('path/to/database');
```

// The Tdlib instance is then used to send a message to a chat when the floating action button is pressed.
// The app uses the Material Design theme and has a simple UI with a text label and a button.
// The button is used to send a message to a chat, and the text label displays the number of times the button has been pressed.
// The app uses the Tdlib package to interact with the Telegram API and send messages to chats.
// The package is initialized with the API ID, hash, and database path, and then used to send messages to chats.
