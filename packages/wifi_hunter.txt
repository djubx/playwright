# Description

The `wifi_hunter` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed for developers who need to manage and interact with Wi-Fi networks in their Flutter applications. This package allows you to scan for available Wi-Fi networks, connect to them, and retrieve detailed information about the networks. 

## When to Use This Package
You might consider using the `wifi_hunter` package in scenarios such as:
- Building a Wi-Fi management app that allows users to view and connect to available networks.
- Creating a network monitoring tool that provides insights into the Wi-Fi environment.
- Developing applications that require network connectivity checks and optimizations.

## Features
- **Scan for Wi-Fi Networks**: Discover all available Wi-Fi networks in the vicinity.
- **Connect to Wi-Fi**: Easily connect to a selected Wi-Fi network.
- **Retrieve Network Information**: Get detailed information about the connected network, such as SSID, BSSID, and signal strength.

## Setup Process

To get started with the `wifi_hunter` package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add Dependency
Add the `wifi_hunter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  wifi_hunter: ^latest_version
```

Replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

### Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CHANGE_WIFI_STATE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

#### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request location permissions:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to scan for Wi-Fi networks.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to scan for Wi-Fi networks.</string>
```

### Step 3: Import the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:wifi_hunter/wifi_hunter.dart';
```

### Step 4: Request Permissions
Before scanning for networks, ensure you have the necessary permissions. You can use the `permission_handler` package to manage permissions effectively.

### Step 5: Initialize and Use
You can now initialize the `wifi_hunter` package and start scanning for networks. 

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  // Request permissions here
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

This setup will prepare your Flutter application to utilize the `wifi_hunter` package effectively.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:wifi_hunter/wifi_hunter.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  // Initialize the WifiHunter package
  await WifiHunter.initialize();
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'WiFi Hunter',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: WifiHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class WifiHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _WifiHomePageState createState() => _WifiHomePageState();
}

class _WifiHomePageState extends State<WifiHomePage> {
  List<WifiNetwork> _networks = []; // List to hold scanned networks

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _scanForNetworks(); // Start scanning for networks on initialization
  }

  // Function to scan for available Wi-Fi networks
  Future<void> _scanForNetworks() async {
    try {
      // Scan for networks
      List<WifiNetwork> networks = await WifiHunter.scan();
      setState(() {
        _networks = networks; // Update the state with scanned networks
      });
    } catch (e) {
      print("Error scanning for networks: $e");
    }
  }

  // Function to connect to a selected Wi-Fi network
  Future<void> _connectToNetwork(String ssid, String password) async {
    try {
      bool success = await WifiHunter.connect(ssid, password);
      if (success) {
        print("Connected to $ssid");
      } else {
        print("Failed to connect to $ssid");
      }
    } catch (e) {
      print("Error connecting to network: $e");
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Available Wi-Fi Networks'),
      ),
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: _networks.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          final network = _networks[index];
          return ListTile(
            title: Text(network.ssid), // Display the SSID of the network
            subtitle: Text('Signal Strength: ${network.signalStrength} dBm'), // Display signal strength
            trailing: ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Connect to the network when the button is pressed
                _connectToNetwork(network.ssid, 'your_password_here');
              },
              child: Text('Connect'),
            ),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, initializing the WifiHunter package.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. The WifiHomePage widget is displayed, which scans for available Wi-Fi networks.
// 4. The scanned networks are displayed in a ListView, showing the SSID and signal strength.
// 5. Users can connect to a network by pressing the "Connect" button, which triggers the connection process.
```
