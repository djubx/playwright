# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `password_text_field`

## Installation
To use the `password_text_field` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  password_text_field: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Usage
### Basic Setup
To use the `password_text_field`, you need to import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:password_text_field/password_text_field.dart';
```

### Platform-Specific Details
- **Android**: Ensure that your app has the necessary permissions to access the internet if you are validating passwords against a remote server.
- **iOS**: Make sure to configure your app's Info.plist if you are using any external services for password validation.

### Example Usage
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the `password_text_field` in a Flutter application:

```dart
PasswordTextField(
  controller: _passwordController,
  hintText: 'Enter your password',
  isPasswordVisible: _isPasswordVisible,
  onTogglePasswordVisibility: () {
    setState(() {
      _isPasswordVisible = !_isPasswordVisible;
    });
  },
  validator: (value) {
    if (value == null || value.isEmpty) {
      return 'Password cannot be empty';
    }
    return null;
  },
)
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to create a password text field with a toggle for visibility and basic validation.

# Complete Example of Using `password_text_field`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:password_text_field/password_text_field.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Controller to manage the password input
  final TextEditingController _passwordController = TextEditingController();
  // State variable to manage password visibility
  bool _isPasswordVisible = false;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Password Text Field Example'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Column(
            children: [
              // Password text field with visibility toggle
              PasswordTextField(
                controller: _passwordController,
                hintText: 'Enter your password',
                isPasswordVisible: _isPasswordVisible,
                onTogglePasswordVisibility: () {
                  // Toggle the visibility of the password
                  setState(() {
                    _isPasswordVisible = !_isPasswordVisible;
                  });
                },
                validator: (value) {
                  // Validate the password input
                  if (value == null || value.isEmpty) {
                    return 'Password cannot be empty';
                  }
                  return null;
                },
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Handle the password submission
                  if (_passwordController.text.isNotEmpty) {
                    // Here you can add your logic to handle the password
                    print('Password submitted: ${_passwordController.text}');
                  }
                },
                child: Text('Submit'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the password input.
// 3. A TextEditingController is created to manage the password input field.
// 4. The build method constructs the UI, including an AppBar and a PasswordTextField.
// 5. The PasswordTextField allows users to enter their password and toggle its visibility.
// 6. When the user presses the Submit button, the app checks if the password is not empty and prints it to the console.
