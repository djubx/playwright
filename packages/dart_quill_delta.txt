# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `dart_quill_delta`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `dart_quill_delta` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dart_quill_delta: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file, especially if you plan to use features like file storage or network access.

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to upload images.</string>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to create a rich text editor using the `dart_quill_delta` package.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dart_quill_delta/dart_quill_delta.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dart Quill Delta Example',
      home: RichTextEditor(),
    );
  }
}

class RichTextEditor extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RichTextEditorState createState() => _RichTextEditorState();
}

class _RichTextEditorState extends State<RichTextEditor> {
  // Initialize a Delta object to hold the document content
  Delta _delta = Delta()..insert('Hello, World!\n');

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Rich Text Editor'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Display the rich text content
          Expanded(
            child: SingleChildScrollView(
              child: Text(
                _delta.toPlainText(), // Convert Delta to plain text for display
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18),
              ),
            ),
          ),
          // Button to add formatted text
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: _addFormattedText,
            child: Text('Add Formatted Text'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }

  // Method to add formatted text to the Delta object
  void _addFormattedText() {
    setState(() {
      // Insert formatted text into the Delta
      _delta.insert('This is bold text.', {'bold': true});
      _delta.insert('\n'); // Add a new line
    });
  }
}
```

```dart
// The above code creates a simple Flutter application with a rich text editor.
// 
// 1. The `main` function initializes the app and sets `RealFlutter` as the home widget.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` class builds the main structure of the app, including the title.
// 3. The `RichTextEditor` class is a stateful widget that manages the rich text content.
// 4. A `Delta` object is initialized to hold the text content.
// 5. The `build` method constructs the UI, displaying the text and a button to add formatted text.
// 6. The `_addFormattedText` method updates the Delta object to include bold text when the button is pressed.
// 7. The text is displayed using the `toPlainText` method, which converts the Delta to plain text for rendering.
// 
// This simple example demonstrates how to use the `dart_quill_delta` package to manage rich text content in a Flutter application.
