<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Feature Flags with the `feature_flags_toggly` Flutter Package

The `feature_flags_toggly` package is a powerful tool for managing feature flags in Flutter applications. Feature flags allow developers to enable or disable features dynamically without deploying new code. This is particularly useful for A/B testing, gradual rollouts, and toggling features based on user segments or environments.

## When to Use This Package

- **A/B Testing**: Test different versions of a feature with a subset of users.
- **Gradual Rollouts**: Release a feature to a small percentage of users before a full rollout.
- **User Segmentation**: Enable features for specific user groups based on their profile or behavior.
- **Environment Configuration**: Toggle features based on the environment (development, staging, production).

## Key Features

- **Simple API**: Easy to integrate and use within your Flutter application.
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Change feature flags without redeploying the app.
- **Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Real-time Updates**: Supports real-time updates to feature flags.

By leveraging the `feature_flags_toggly` package, developers can enhance their application's flexibility and responsiveness to user needs.

# Setting Up the `feature_flags_toggly` Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `feature_flags_toggly` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `feature_flags_toggly` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  feature_flags_toggly: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

1. Open `ios/Podfile`.
2. Uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Initialize the Package

In your main Dart file, initialize the `feature_flags_toggly` package. You can do this in the `main()` function:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:feature_flags_toggly/feature_flags_toggly.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  FeatureFlagsToggly.initialize(); // Initialize the package
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 4: Using Feature Flags

You can now use feature flags in your application. Here’s how to check if a feature is enabled:

```dart
if (FeatureFlagsToggly.isFeatureEnabled('new_feature')) {
  // Show new feature
} else {
  // Show old feature
}
```

You can also listen for changes in feature flags:

```dart
FeatureFlagsToggly.onFeatureChanged.listen((flag) {
  // Handle feature flag changes
});
```

With these steps, you are now ready to use the `feature_flags_toggly` package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Using `feature_flags_toggly`

Here’s a complete example of a Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the `feature_flags_toggly` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:feature_flags_toggly/feature_flags_toggly.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  FeatureFlagsToggly.initialize(); // Initialize the feature flags package
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the main application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Feature Flags Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Feature Flags Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: FeatureToggleWidget(), // Widget that toggles features
      ),
    );
  }
}

class FeatureToggleWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Check if the new feature is enabled
    if (FeatureFlagsToggly.isFeatureEnabled('new_feature')) {
      return NewFeatureWidget(); // Show new feature widget
    } else {
      return OldFeatureWidget(); // Show old feature widget
    }
  }
}

class NewFeatureWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Text(
      'This is the new feature!',
      style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.green),
    );
  }
}

class OldFeatureWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Text(
      'This is the old feature.',
      style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.red),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts in the main() function, initializing the feature flags package.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is displayed, containing a FeatureToggleWidget.
// 4. The FeatureToggleWidget checks if the 'new_feature' flag is enabled.
// 5. If the flag is enabled, the NewFeatureWidget is displayed; otherwise, the OldFeatureWidget is shown.
// 6. This allows for dynamic feature toggling based on the feature flags configuration.
```
