# Setting Up and Using Total Lints

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `total_lints` package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter projects.

## Installation

To get started with `total_lints`, you need to add it to your `dev_dependencies` in the `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  total_lints: ^1.0.0
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Configuration

Next, you need to configure the linting rules. Create a file named `analysis_options.yaml` in the root of your Flutter project and add the following content:

```yaml
include: package:total_lints/analysis_options.yaml
```

This will include all the default linting rules provided by the `total_lints` package.

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android
For Android, ensure that your project is set up to use the latest version of the Flutter SDK. The `total_lints` package does not require any additional configuration for Android.

### iOS
Similarly, for iOS, make sure your project is using the latest Flutter SDK. No additional configurations are needed for iOS when using `total_lints`.

## Running Lints

To run the linter, you can use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
flutter analyze
```

This command will analyze your codebase and provide feedback based on the linting rules defined in your `analysis_options.yaml` file.

By following these steps, you can successfully set up and start using the `total_lints` package in your Flutter projects.

# Complete Example of Using Total Lints

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // The main widget of the application
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Total Lints Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // The home page of the application
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Total Lints Example Home Page'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Welcome to Total Lints Example!',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The runApp function takes the RealFlutter widget and makes it the root of the widget tree.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp, which is the main structure of the app.
// 4. The MaterialApp has a title and a theme defined.
// 5. The home property of the MaterialApp is set to MyHomePage, which is the main screen of the app.
// 6. MyHomePage is a StatelessWidget that builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a centered Text widget.
// 7. The Text widget displays a welcome message to the user.
