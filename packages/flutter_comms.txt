# Flutter Comms Package Overview
=====================================

The `flutter_comms` package is a powerful tool for handling communication between Flutter applications and external devices or services. It provides a simple and efficient way to establish connections, send and receive data, and manage communication protocols.

### When to Use

The `flutter_comms` package is ideal for applications that require communication with external devices or services, such as:

* IoT devices
* Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices
* Serial communication devices
* Network services

### Features

The `flutter_comms` package offers the following features:

* Support for multiple communication protocols (e.g., BLE, serial, network)
* Easy-to-use API for establishing connections and sending/receiving data
* Automatic connection management and error handling
* Cross-platform compatibility (Android and iOS)

# Setting Up and Using the Flutter Comms Package
=============================================

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

Add the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  flutter_comms: ^1.0.0
```
Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:flutter_comms/flutter_comms.dart';
```
### Step 3: Initialize the Package

Initialize the package by calling the `init` method:
```dart
await FlutterComms.init();
```
### Step 4: Establish a Connection

Establish a connection using the `connect` method:
```dart
await FlutterComms.connect('your_device_id');
```
### Step 5: Send and Receive Data

Send data using the `send` method:
```dart
await FlutterComms.send('your_data');
```
Receive data using the `receive` method:
```dart
final data = await FlutterComms.receive();
```
### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

* Add the following permission to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" />
```
* Use the `FlutterCommsAndroid` class to access Android-specific features.

#### iOS

* Add the following permission to your `Info.plist` file:
```xml
<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>Your app needs access to Bluetooth</string>
```
* Use the `FlutterCommsIOS` class to access iOS-specific features.

        body: Center(
          child: Text('Hello, world!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The app starts by initializing the FlutterComms package.
// Then, it creates a new instance of the RealFlutter class.
// The RealFlutter class establishes a connection using the FlutterComms package.
// After establishing a connection, the RealFlutter class sends data using the FlutterComms package.
// The RealFlutter class then receives data using the FlutterComms package.
// Finally, the app prints the received data to the console.
// The app also runs a simple Material app with a title and a body.
