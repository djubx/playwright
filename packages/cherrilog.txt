# Cherrilog Flutter Package: A Comprehensive Overview

Cherrilog is a powerful logging package for Flutter applications that allows developers to easily log messages, errors, and other important information. It is designed to help developers track the behavior of their applications, making debugging and monitoring more efficient. Cherrilog is particularly useful in production environments where understanding application behavior is crucial.

## When to Use Cherrilog
- **Debugging**: When you need to track down issues in your application.
- **Monitoring**: To keep an eye on application performance and user interactions.
- **Error Reporting**: To log errors and exceptions for later analysis.

## Key Features
- **Custom Log Levels**: Define your own log levels to categorize messages.
- **File Logging**: Save logs to a file for persistent storage.
- **Remote Logging**: Send logs to a remote server for centralized monitoring.
- **Filter Logs**: Easily filter logs based on severity or other criteria.
- **Integration with Flutter**: Seamlessly integrates with Flutter's logging system.

Cherrilog is an excellent choice for developers looking to enhance their application's logging capabilities while maintaining a clean and organized codebase.

# Cherrilog Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with Cherrilog, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  cherrilog: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Then, run the following command to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file if you plan to log to external storage:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to configure your app's Info.plist to allow file access if you are logging to files. Add the following key:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the photo library for logging purposes.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To use Cherrilog in your application, you need to initialize it and start logging. Hereâ€™s how you can do that:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cherrilog/cherrilog.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize Cherrilog
  Cherrilog.init();

  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Cherrilog Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Cherrilog Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Log an info message
              Cherrilog.info('Button pressed!');
            },
            child: Text('Press Me'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize Cherrilog in the `main` function and log a message when the button is pressed. You can expand this to log errors, warnings, and other types of messages as needed.

# Complete Example of Cherrilog in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cherrilog/cherrilog.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize Cherrilog for logging
  Cherrilog.init();

  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Cherrilog Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Cherrilog Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Log an info message when the button is pressed
              Cherrilog.info('Button pressed!');
            },
            child: Text('Press Me'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. Cherrilog is initialized to set up logging capabilities.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget is run as the main application widget.
// 4. The MaterialApp widget is created with a title and a home scaffold.
// 5. An AppBar is displayed with the title 'Cherrilog Example'.
// 6. The body of the scaffold contains a centered button.
// 7. When the button is pressed, an info log message is generated using Cherrilog.
// 8. This log message can be viewed in the console or saved to a file, depending on the configuration.
```
