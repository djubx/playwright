# Overview of the redux_dev_tools Flutter Package

The `redux_dev_tools` package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who are using the Redux state management pattern. This package provides a way to integrate Redux DevTools into your Flutter application, allowing you to inspect and debug your application's state changes in real-time. 

## When to Use This Package
You should consider using `redux_dev_tools` when:
- You are building a complex Flutter application that requires state management.
- You want to have a clear view of the state changes and actions being dispatched in your application.
- You need to debug your application efficiently without cluttering your code with print statements.

## Key Features
- **Real-time State Inspection**: View the current state of your application and how it changes over time.
- **Action Logging**: See all actions dispatched to the Redux store, which helps in understanding the flow of data.
- **Time Travel Debugging**: Go back and forth in the state history to see how your application reached its current state.
- **Integration with Redux**: Seamlessly integrates with the Redux architecture, making it easy to set up and use.

Overall, `redux_dev_tools` enhances the development experience by providing insights into the state management process, making it easier to identify issues and optimize performance.

# Setting Up and Using redux_dev_tools

## Installation
To get started with `redux_dev_tools`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  redux: ^5.0.0
  redux_dev_tools: ^0.7.0
```

After adding the dependencies, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Configuration for Android and iOS
### Android
1. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21.
2. No additional configuration is required for Android.

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode.
2. Ensure that your deployment target is set to at least iOS 9.0.

## Basic Usage
To use `redux_dev_tools`, you need to wrap your Redux store with the `DevToolsStore` and connect it to the Redux DevTools extension. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:redux/redux.dart';
import 'package:redux_dev_tools/redux_dev_tools.dart';

void main() {
  final store = DevToolsStore<AppState>(
    appReducer,
    initialState: AppState(),
  );

  runApp(MyApp(store: store));
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  final Store<AppState> store;

  MyApp({required this.store});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return StoreProvider<AppState>(
      store: store,
      child: MaterialApp(
        home: MyHomePage(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a `DevToolsStore` that wraps our Redux store, allowing us to use the Redux DevTools.

# Complete Example of redux_dev_tools in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:redux/redux.dart';
import 'package:redux_dev_tools/redux_dev_tools.dart';

// Define the application state
class AppState {
  int counter;

  AppState({this.counter = 0});
}

// Define actions
enum Actions { Increment, Decrement }

// Define the reducer
AppState appReducer(AppState state, dynamic action) {
  switch (action) {
    case Actions.Increment:
      return AppState(counter: state.counter + 1);
    case Actions.Decrement:
      return AppState(counter: state.counter - 1);
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

void main() {
  // Create a DevToolsStore with the appReducer and initial state
  final store = DevToolsStore<AppState>(
    appReducer,
    initialState: AppState(),
  );

  // Run the app
  runApp(MyApp(store: store));
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  final Store<AppState> store;

  MyApp({required this.store});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return StoreProvider<AppState>(
      store: store,
      child: MaterialApp(
        title: 'Redux Dev Tools Example',
        home: MyHomePage(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Access the store
    final store = StoreProvider.of<AppState>(context);

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Redux Dev Tools Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display the current counter value
            Text(
              'Counter: ${store.state.counter}',
              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline4,
            ),
            Row(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              children: <Widget>[
                // Increment button
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () {
                    store.dispatch(Actions.Increment);
                  },
                  child: Text('Increment'),
                ),
                SizedBox(width: 20),
                // Decrement button
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () {
                    store.dispatch(Actions.Decrement);
                  },
                  child: Text('Decrement'),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts in the main function, where we create a DevToolsStore with the appReducer and initial state.
// 2. The MyApp widget is built, which provides the store to the entire widget tree using StoreProvider.
// 3. MyHomePage is displayed, which contains the UI for the counter.
// 4. The current counter value is displayed, and two buttons (Increment and Decrement) are provided.
// 5. When the Increment button is pressed, an action is dispatched to the store, which updates the state.
// 6. The UI automatically rebuilds to reflect the new counter value due to the StoreProvider.
```
