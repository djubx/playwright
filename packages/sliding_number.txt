# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Sliding Number Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To use the sliding_number package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  sliding_number: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install the Package
Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Import the Package
In your Dart file, import the sliding_number package:

```dart
import 'package:sliding_number/sliding_number.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Widget
You can now use the `SlidingNumber` widget in your application. Below is a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
SlidingNumber(
  value: 1234, // The number to display
  duration: Duration(seconds: 1), // Duration of the sliding animation
  textStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 48, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold), // Customize text style
)
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Optimizations
- **Performance**: Use the `SlidingNumber` widget in a `ListView` or `GridView` for better performance when displaying multiple numbers.
- **State Management**: Consider using state management solutions like Provider or Riverpod to manage the state of the numbers being displayed.

With these steps, you should be able to successfully integrate and use the sliding_number package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Sliding Number Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sliding_number/sliding_number.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sliding Number Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Sliding Number Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: NumberDisplay(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class NumberDisplay extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _NumberDisplayState createState() => _NumberDisplayState();
}

class _NumberDisplayState extends State<NumberDisplay> {
  int _currentValue = 0; // Initialize the current value

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _startSliding(); // Start the sliding number animation
  }

  void _startSliding() {
    // Update the number every second
    Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1), () {
      setState(() {
        _currentValue += 10; // Increment the value by 10
      });
      _startSliding(); // Recursively call to continue the animation
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return SlidingNumber(
      value: _currentValue, // Display the current value
      duration: Duration(milliseconds: 500), // Animation duration
      textStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 48, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold), // Text style
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a centered NumberDisplay widget.
// 4. NumberDisplay is a StatefulWidget that manages the current number value.
// 5. In initState, the _startSliding method is called to begin the number updates.
// 6. _startSliding uses a Future.delayed to increment the number every second.
// 7. The build method returns a SlidingNumber widget displaying the current value.
// 8. The SlidingNumber widget animates the transition of the number smoothly.
```
