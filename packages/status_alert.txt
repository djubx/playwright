# Overview of the `status_alert` Flutter Package

The `status_alert` package is a versatile Flutter library designed to provide developers with a simple and effective way to display status alerts in their applications. These alerts can be used to inform users about the success or failure of an operation, provide feedback, or simply display a message in a visually appealing manner.

## When to Use `status_alert`

- **Feedback for User Actions**: Use it to notify users about the success or failure of their actions, such as form submissions or data updates.
- **Status Updates**: Display ongoing status updates, like loading indicators or process completions.
- **Error Handling**: Alert users to errors or issues that need their attention.

## Features

- **Customizable Alerts**: Easily customize the appearance and behavior of alerts to match your app's theme.
- **Icon Support**: Include icons to make alerts more informative and visually appealing.
- **Animation**: Built-in animations to smoothly display and dismiss alerts.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

# Setting Up and Using the `status_alert` Package

In this section, we'll walk through the setup process for the `status_alert` package and demonstrate how to integrate it into a Flutter application.

## Installation

To use the `status_alert` package, add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  status_alert: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Basic Usage

### Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the `status_alert` package:

```dart
import 'package:status_alert/status_alert.dart';
```

### Displaying a Simple Alert

To display a basic status alert, use the `StatusAlert.show` method:

```dart
StatusAlert.show(
  context,
  title: 'Success',
  subtitle: 'Your operation was successful!',
  configuration: IconConfiguration(icon: Icons.check),
);
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions and configurations for displaying overlays if required.

### iOS

For iOS, make sure your `Info.plist` is configured to allow alerts and notifications if your app uses them.

## Optimizations

- **Performance**: Minimize the use of alerts to avoid overwhelming users and degrading app performance.
- **Design Consistency**: Customize alerts to maintain a consistent design language across your app.

# Complete Example of Using `status_alert` in a Flutter App

Below is a complete example of a Flutter application that demonstrates the key features of the `status_alert` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:status_alert/status_alert.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Status Alert Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Status Alert Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Display a status alert when the button is pressed
            StatusAlert.show(
              context,
              duration: Duration(seconds: 2),
              title: 'Success',
              subtitle: 'Your operation was successful!',
              configuration: IconConfiguration(icon: Icons.check),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Show Alert'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The `main` function is the entry point of the Flutter application.
// It calls `runApp` with an instance of `RealFlutter`, which is the root widget of the app.

// `RealFlutter` is a stateless widget that builds the main structure of the app.
// It uses `MaterialApp` to set up the app's theme and home page.

// `HomePage` is a stateless widget that represents the main screen of the app.
// It contains an `AppBar` and a centered `ElevatedButton`.

// When the button is pressed, it triggers the `StatusAlert.show` method.
// This method displays a status alert with a title, subtitle, and an icon.
// The alert is shown for a duration of 2 seconds before automatically dismissing.

// The app demonstrates how to integrate and use the `status_alert` package to provide feedback to users.
