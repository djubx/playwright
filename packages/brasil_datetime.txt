# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Brasil Datetime Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `brasil_datetime` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  brasil_datetime: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` to support localization. Add the following key-value pair:

```xml
<key>CFBundleLocalizations</key>
<array>
    <string>pt</string>
</array>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to format and manipulate dates using the `brasil_datetime` package.

# Complete Example: Using Brasil Datetime in a Flutter App

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:brasil_datetime/brasil_datetime.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Brasil Datetime Example',
      home: DateTimeExample(),
    );
  }
}

class DateTimeExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Get the current date
    DateTime now = DateTime.now();

    // Format the current date to Brazilian format
    String formattedDate = DateTimeBr.format(now);

    // Add 10 days to the current date
    DateTime futureDate = now.add(Duration(days: 10));
    String formattedFutureDate = DateTimeBr.format(futureDate);

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Brasil Datetime Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Current Date: $formattedDate'),
            Text('Date after 10 days: $formattedFutureDate'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application starts by running the RealFlutter widget.
// Inside RealFlutter, we set up a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget.
// The DateTimeExample widget is where we demonstrate the use of the brasil_datetime package.
// We retrieve the current date and format it using DateTimeBr.format().
// We also calculate a future date by adding 10 days to the current date.
// Both the current date and the future date are displayed in the center of the screen.
```
<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, the application starts by running the `RealFlutter` widget, which sets up a `MaterialApp`. The `DateTimeExample` widget demonstrates the use of the `brasil_datetime` package by retrieving the current date, formatting it, and displaying it. It also calculates a future date by adding 10 days to the current date and formats that as well. Both dates are displayed in the center of the screen, showcasing the package's functionality in a simple and effective manner.
