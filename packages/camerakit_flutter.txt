# Tutorial

## Setup Process

To get started with the `camerakit_flutter` package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the `camerakit_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  camerakit_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/camerakit_flutter).

### Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open `AndroidManifest.xml` located in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
   ```

2. **Camera Features**: Also in `AndroidManifest.xml`, add the camera feature:

   ```xml
   <uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera" android:required="true"/>
   <uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera.autofocus"/>
   ```

#### iOS Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open `Info.plist` located in `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys:

   ```xml
   <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your camera to take pictures.</string>
   <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your photo library to save pictures.</string>
   ```

### Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:camerakit_flutter/camerakit_flutter.dart';
```

### Step 4: Initialize the Camera

You can now initialize the camera in your Flutter application. Make sure to handle permissions and camera lifecycle properly.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:camerakit_flutter/camerakit_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  CameraKitController _cameraKitController;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the CameraKitController
    _cameraKitController = CameraKitController();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the controller when the widget is removed from the widget tree
    _cameraKitController.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  void _captureImage() async {
    // Capture an image and get the file path
    String imagePath = await _cameraKitController.captureImage();
    // Display the captured image path
    print("Image captured at: $imagePath");
  }

  void _startVideoRecording() async {
    // Start video recording
    await _cameraKitController.startVideoRecording();
    print("Video recording started.");
  }

  void _stopVideoRecording() async {
    // Stop video recording
    String videoPath = await _cameraKitController.stopVideoRecording();
    // Display the recorded video path
    print("Video recorded at: $videoPath");
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('CameraKit Flutter Example'),
        ),
        body: Column(
          children: [
            // Display the camera preview
            Expanded(
              child: CameraKitPreview(
                controller: _cameraKitController,
                aspectRatio: CameraKitAspectRatio.ratio4_3,
              ),
            ),
            Row(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              children: [
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: _captureImage,
                  child: Text('Capture Image'),
                ),
                SizedBox(width: 20),
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: _startVideoRecording,
                  child: Text('Start Video'),
                ),
                SizedBox(width: 20),
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: _stopVideoRecording,
                  child: Text('Stop Video'),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget initializes the CameraKitController in its state.
// 3. The camera preview is displayed using the CameraKitPreview widget.
// 4. The user can capture an image by pressing the 'Capture Image' button, which calls the _captureImage method.
// 5. The user can start video recording by pressing the 'Start Video' button, which calls the _startVideoRecording method.
// 6. The user can stop video recording by pressing the 'Stop Video' button, which calls the _stopVideoRecording method.
// 7. The captured image and recorded video paths are printed to the console for reference.
