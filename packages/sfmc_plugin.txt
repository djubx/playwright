# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using sfmc_plugin

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `sfmc_plugin` and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `sfmc_plugin` to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  sfmc_plugin: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Add the necessary permissions and services in your `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.yourapp">

    <application>
        <!-- Add this line to enable push notifications -->
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.google.firebase.messaging.default_notification_channel_id"
            android:value="default_channel_id" />
    </application>

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED"/>
</manifest>
```

2. **Firebase Setup**: Ensure you have Firebase set up in your Android project. Follow the [Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup) for detailed instructions.

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Add the following keys to your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>fetch</string>
    <string>remote-notification</string>
</array>
<key>FirebaseAppDelegateProxyEnabled</key>
<false/>
```

2. **Push Notification Setup**: Follow the [Apple Developer documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/registering_your_app_with_apns) to register your app for push notifications.

## Step 3: Using the sfmc_plugin

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your Flutter application.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sfmc_plugin/sfmc_plugin.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'SFMC Plugin Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('SFMC Plugin Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Initialize the SFMC plugin
              SFMCPlugin.initialize(
                appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID',
                accessToken: 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN',
              );

              // Subscribe to push notifications
              SFMCPlugin.subscribeToPushNotifications();
            },
            child: Text('Initialize SFMC'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize the `sfmc_plugin` and subscribe to push notifications when the button is pressed.

# Complete Example of sfmc_plugin

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sfmc_plugin/sfmc_plugin.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'SFMC Plugin Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('SFMC Plugin Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Initialize the SFMC plugin with your app ID and access token
              SFMCPlugin.initialize(
                appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID', // Replace with your actual app ID
                accessToken: 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN', // Replace with your actual access token
              );

              // Subscribe to push notifications
              SFMCPlugin.subscribeToPushNotifications();
            },
            child: Text('Initialize SFMC'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and displays a button labeled "Initialize SFMC".
// 2. When the button is pressed, the SFMC plugin is initialized with the provided app ID and access token.
// 3. After initialization, the app subscribes to push notifications, allowing the app to receive messages from SFMC.
// 4. This setup is essential for engaging users through notifications and tracking their interactions with the app.
