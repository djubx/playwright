# Klippa Scanner SDK: Setup and Usage Tutorial

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the **klippa_scanner_sdk** package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Installation

To get started, add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  klippa_scanner_sdk: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/klippa_scanner_sdk).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure you have the following configurations:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       compileSdkVersion 31 // or latest
       ...
   }
   ```

2. Add the required permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
   ```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request camera access:
   ```xml
   <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to the camera to scan documents.</string>
   <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to the photo library to save scanned documents.</string>
   ```

## Basic Usage

To use the **klippa_scanner_sdk**, you can create a simple interface that allows users to scan documents. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:klippa_scanner_sdk/klippa_scanner_sdk.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Document Scanner')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Start the document scanning process
              final result = await KlippaScannerSdk.scanDocuments();
              // Handle the scanned documents
              if (result != null) {
                // Process the scanned documents
                print('Scanned documents: $result');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Scan Document'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app with a button that initiates the document scanning process when pressed. The scanned documents are then printed to the console.

With this setup, you are ready to start scanning documents in your Flutter application!

                  builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                    title: Text('Scanned Documents'),
                    content: SingleChildScrollView(
                      child: ListBody(
                        children: result.map<Widget>((doc) {
                          return Text(doc.toString());
                        }).toList(),
                      ),
                    ),
                    actions: <Widget>[
                      TextButton(
                        child: Text('OK'),
                        onPressed: () {
                          Navigator.of(context).pop();
                        },
                      ),
                    ],
                  ),
                );
              } else {
                // Handle the case where no documents were scanned
                print('No documents scanned.');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Scan Document'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation
// The application starts with the main function that runs the RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a simple UI containing an AppBar and a button.
// When the button is pressed, it triggers the document scanning process using KlippaScannerSdk.scanDocuments().
// If documents are scanned successfully, they are printed to the console and displayed in an AlertDialog.
// If no documents are scanned, a message is printed to the console indicating that no documents were found.
// This flow allows users to easily scan documents and view the results in a user-friendly manner.
