<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Flutter Screen Scaler Package

The `flutter_screen_scaler` package is a powerful tool designed to help Flutter developers create responsive applications that adapt to various screen sizes and resolutions. This package simplifies the process of scaling UI elements, ensuring that your app looks great on all devices, from small phones to large tablets.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using `flutter_screen_scaler` when:
- You want to create a responsive UI that adjusts to different screen sizes.
- You are developing applications that will be used on multiple devices with varying resolutions.
- You need to maintain consistent spacing, padding, and font sizes across different screen dimensions.

## Features

- **Dynamic Scaling**: Automatically scales UI elements based on the device's screen size.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup process that integrates seamlessly with existing Flutter projects.
- **Customizable**: Allows developers to define their scaling factors for more control over the UI.

By using `flutter_screen_scaler`, you can ensure that your Flutter applications provide a consistent user experience across all devices.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_screen_scaler

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_screen_scaler` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_screen_scaler: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_screen_scaler/flutter_screen_scaler.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the ScreenScaler

To use the `ScreenScaler`, you need to wrap your main widget with `ScreenScaler`. Here’s how to do it:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ScreenScaler(
      // This will scale the entire app based on the screen size
      child: MaterialApp(
        home: HomeScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Scaling UI Elements

You can now use the `ScreenScaler` to scale your UI elements. Here’s an example of how to create a responsive button:

```dart
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create an instance of ScreenScaler
    ScreenScaler scaler = ScreenScaler();

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Screen Scaler Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Container(
          width: scaler.getWidth(50), // 50% of the screen width
          height: scaler.getHeight(10), // 10% of the screen height
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Button action
            },
            child: Text(
              'Click Me',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: scaler.getTextSize(5)), // Scaled text size
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the button's width, height, and text size are dynamically scaled based on the screen size, ensuring a responsive design.

# Complete Example of flutter_screen_scaler

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_screen_scaler/flutter_screen_scaler.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Wrap the MaterialApp with ScreenScaler for responsive design
    return ScreenScaler(
      child: MaterialApp(
        home: HomeScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create an instance of ScreenScaler
    ScreenScaler scaler = ScreenScaler();

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Screen Scaler Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Container(
          width: scaler.getWidth(50), // 50% of the screen width
          height: scaler.getHeight(10), // 10% of the screen height
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Button action
              print('Button Pressed!');
            },
            child: Text(
              'Click Me',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: scaler.getTextSize(5)), // Scaled text size
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that wraps the MaterialApp with ScreenScaler.
// 3. HomeScreen is displayed as the home widget of the MaterialApp.
// 4. Inside HomeScreen, an instance of ScreenScaler is created to access scaling methods.
// 5. A Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 6. A Container is used to hold an ElevatedButton, with its width and height set to a percentage of the screen size.
// 7. The button's text size is also scaled based on the screen size.
// 8. When the button is pressed, a message is printed to the console.
```
