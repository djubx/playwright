# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_textfield_autocomplete

## Installation
To get started with the `flutter_textfield_autocomplete` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_textfield_autocomplete: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version of the package, which you can find on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_textfield_autocomplete).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable the necessary permissions in your `Info.plist` if you are using any features that require user permissions.

## Using the Package
Once you have installed the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Here’s a simple example of how to implement an autocomplete text field.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_textfield_autocomplete/flutter_textfield_autocomplete.dart';
```

2. Create a StatefulWidget to manage the state of the autocomplete suggestions.

3. Use the `TextFieldAutocomplete` widget to implement the autocomplete functionality.

Here’s a basic implementation:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // List of suggestions
  final List<String> _suggestions = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry', 'Date', 'Fig', 'Grape'];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Autocomplete Example')),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: TextFieldAutocomplete(
          suggestions: _suggestions,
          onChanged: (value) {
            // Handle changes
          },
          decoration: InputDecoration(
            hintText: 'Type a fruit name',
            border: OutlineInputBorder(),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic autocomplete text field that suggests fruit names as the user types.

# Complete Example of flutter_textfield_autocomplete

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_textfield_autocomplete/flutter_textfield_autocomplete.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Autocomplete Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // List of suggestions for the autocomplete
  final List<String> _suggestions = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry', 'Date', 'Fig', 'Grape'];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Autocomplete Example')),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: TextFieldAutocomplete(
          suggestions: _suggestions, // Providing the list of suggestions
          onChanged: (value) {
            // This callback is triggered when the text changes
            print('Current input: $value');
          },
          decoration: InputDecoration(
            hintText: 'Type a fruit name', // Placeholder text
            border: OutlineInputBorder(), // Styling the text field
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets MyApp as the home widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home screen.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the autocomplete suggestions.
// 4. The _suggestions list contains predefined fruit names that will be shown as suggestions.
// 5. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a TextFieldAutocomplete widget.
// 6. The TextFieldAutocomplete widget takes the suggestions list and a callback for when the text changes.
// 7. As the user types, the suggestions will appear based on the input, enhancing the user experience.
