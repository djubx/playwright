# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the QRCode Reader Web Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the `qrcode_reader_web` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  qrcode_reader_web: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/qrcode_reader_web).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### For Web
1. **Permissions**: Ensure that your web application has permission to access the camera. This is typically handled by the browser, but you may need to inform users to allow camera access when prompted.
2. **HTTPS Requirement**: The camera access feature requires your web application to be served over HTTPS. Make sure your development server or hosting supports HTTPS.

### For Android and iOS
While this package is primarily for web applications, if you plan to use QR code scanning in mobile applications, consider using the `qr_code_scanner` package for Android and iOS platforms.

## Step 3: Using the Package
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the `qrcode_reader_web` package in your Flutter application:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:qrcode_reader_web/qrcode_reader_web.dart';
```

2. Create a function to initiate the QR code scanning process:

```dart
void scanQRCode() async {
  String result = await QRCodeReaderWeb.scan();
  print("QR Code Result: $result");
}
```

3. Call this function from a button or any other UI element in your Flutter app.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the `qrcode_reader_web` package effectively in your Flutter web application.

# Complete Example of QRCode Reader Web

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:qrcode_reader_web/qrcode_reader_web.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'QR Code Reader Web',
      home: QRCodeScanner(),
    );
  }
}

class QRCodeScanner extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _QRCodeScannerState createState() => _QRCodeScannerState();
}

class _QRCodeScannerState extends State<QRCodeScanner> {
  String _qrResult = "Scan a QR code";

  // Function to initiate QR code scanning
  void _scanQRCode() async {
    // Call the scan method from the qrcode_reader_web package
    String result = await QRCodeReaderWeb.scan();
    
    // Update the state with the scanned result
    setState(() {
      _qrResult = result; // Store the scanned result
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('QR Code Scanner'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              _qrResult, // Display the scanned result
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _scanQRCode, // Trigger the scan on button press
              child: Text('Scan QR Code'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home widget (QRCodeScanner).
// 3. The QRCodeScanner widget is a stateful widget that manages the state of the scanned QR code result.
// 4. The _scanQRCode function is defined to handle the QR code scanning process.
// 5. When the user presses the "Scan QR Code" button, the _scanQRCode function is called.
// 6. The QRCodeReaderWeb.scan() method is invoked, which opens the camera and scans for a QR code.
// 7. Once a QR code is scanned, the result is stored in the _qrResult variable and displayed on the screen.
