# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Flex Color Scheme

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **flex_color_scheme** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flex_color_scheme: ^6.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Configuring Android and iOS

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    compileSdkVersion 33 // or the latest version
    ...
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, make sure your `ios/Podfile` is set to use the latest platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '12.0' # or the latest version
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a basic theme using **flex_color_scheme**.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flex_color_scheme/flex_color_scheme.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
```

2. Create a `MaterialApp` with a theme using `FlexColorScheme`:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flex Color Scheme Demo',
      theme: FlexColorScheme.light(
        colors: FlexColor.schemes[FlexScheme.material],
      ).toTheme,
      darkTheme: FlexColorScheme.dark(
        colors: FlexColor.schemes[FlexScheme.material],
      ).toTheme,
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flex Color Scheme Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Hello, Flex Color Scheme!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that uses the **flex_color_scheme** package to define light and dark themes. The `FlexColorScheme.light` and `FlexColorScheme.dark` methods are used to create the themes based on the selected color scheme.

# Complete Example of Flex Color Scheme

```dart
import 'package:flex_color_scheme/flex_color_scheme.dart'; // Import the flex_color_scheme package
import 'package:flutter/material.dart'; // Import Flutter material package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Build the MaterialApp with light and dark themes
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flex Color Scheme Demo', // Title of the app
      theme: FlexColorScheme.light( // Define light theme
        colors: FlexColor.schemes[FlexScheme.material], // Use material color scheme
      ).toTheme, // Convert to ThemeData
      darkTheme: FlexColorScheme.dark( // Define dark theme
        colors: FlexColor.schemes[FlexScheme.material], // Use material color scheme
      ).toTheme, // Convert to ThemeData
      home: HomeScreen(), // Set the home screen
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Build the home screen with a Scaffold
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flex Color Scheme Example'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Hello, Flex Color Scheme!'), // Centered text
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp has a title and defines both light and dark themes using FlexColorScheme.
// 4. The HomeScreen widget is set as the home of the MaterialApp.
// 5. HomeScreen builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a centered text widget.
// 6. The app displays a simple message, demonstrating the use of the flex_color_scheme package.
```
