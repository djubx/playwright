# Overview of the ldk_node Flutter Package

The `ldk_node` package is a powerful tool designed for developers looking to integrate Lightning Network capabilities into their Flutter applications. It provides a robust interface for managing Lightning nodes, enabling seamless transactions and interactions with the Bitcoin network. This package is particularly useful for applications that require fast, low-cost transactions, such as wallets, payment processors, and decentralized applications.

## Key Features
- **Node Management**: Create and manage Lightning nodes directly from your Flutter app.
- **Transaction Handling**: Facilitate sending and receiving payments over the Lightning Network.
- **Real-time Updates**: Receive real-time notifications about transaction statuses and node events.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS, making it versatile for mobile app development.

## When to Use
- When building a cryptocurrency wallet that supports Lightning Network transactions.
- For applications that require fast payment processing with minimal fees.
- In decentralized finance (DeFi) applications that leverage Bitcoin's Lightning Network for transactions.

Overall, `ldk_node` is an essential package for developers aiming to harness the power of the Lightning Network in their Flutter applications.

# Setting Up and Using the ldk_node Package

## Installation
To get started with the `ldk_node` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ldk_node: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/ldk_node).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:
   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. Ensure you have the latest iOS deployment target set in your `ios/Podfile`:
   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

## Basic Usage
Once the package is installed and configured, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to initialize a Lightning node and perform basic operations.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ldk_node/ldk_node.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Lightning Node Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late LdkNode _node;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _initializeNode();
  }

  void _initializeNode() async {
    // Initialize the Lightning node
    _node = LdkNode();
    await _node.start();
    // Listen for incoming payments
    _node.onPaymentReceived.listen((payment) {
      print('Payment received: $payment');
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Lightning Node Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Node is running...'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of ldk_node in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ldk_node/ldk_node.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Lightning Node Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late LdkNode _node; // Declare the Lightning node variable

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _initializeNode(); // Initialize the node when the widget is created
  }

  void _initializeNode() async {
    // Create an instance of the LdkNode
    _node = LdkNode();
    await _node.start(); // Start the Lightning node

    // Listen for incoming payments
    _node.onPaymentReceived.listen((payment) {
      // Print the payment details when a payment is received
      print('Payment received: $payment');
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Lightning Node Example'), // Set the app bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Node is running...'), // Display a message indicating the node is active
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter is a stateful widget that initializes the Lightning node in its state.
// 4. In the initState method, _initializeNode is called to set up the Lightning node.
// 5. The LdkNode instance is created and started asynchronously.
// 6. The app listens for incoming payments and prints them to the console.
// 7. The UI displays a simple message indicating that the node is running.
