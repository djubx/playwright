# Overview of the `app_set_id` Flutter Package

The `app_set_id` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to help developers manage and utilize application-specific identifiers across different platforms. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where unique identification of app instances is required, such as in analytics, user tracking, or feature toggling.

## When to Use `app_set_id`

- **Analytics Tracking**: When you need to track user behavior across sessions and devices.
- **Feature Flags**: To enable or disable features based on specific app instances.
- **User Segmentation**: For targeting specific user groups based on their app instance ID.

## Key Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup process with minimal configuration.
- **Unique Identifier Generation**: Automatically generates unique identifiers for each app instance.

The `app_set_id` package simplifies the process of managing app identifiers, making it an essential tool for Flutter developers looking to enhance their applications' capabilities.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `app_set_id`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `app_set_id` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  app_set_id: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to ensure proper permissions:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that the package is set up, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s how to initialize and retrieve the app set ID.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:app_set_id/app_set_id.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'App Set ID Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('App Set ID Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: FutureBuilder<String>(
            future: AppSetId.getAppSetId(), // Fetch the app set ID
            builder: (context, snapshot) {
              if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                return CircularProgressIndicator(); // Show loading indicator
              } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
                return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}'); // Handle error
              } else {
                return Text('App Set ID: ${snapshot.data}'); // Display the ID
              }
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Importing Packages**: The necessary packages are imported at the beginning.
- **Creating the Main Widget**: The `RealFlutter` class extends `StatelessWidget` and builds the main application structure.
- **FutureBuilder**: This widget is used to fetch the app set ID asynchronously and display it.
- **Error Handling**: The code handles loading states and potential errors gracefully.

With these steps, you can successfully integrate the `app_set_id` package into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using `app_set_id`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:app_set_id/app_set_id.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'App Set ID Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('App Set ID Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: FutureBuilder<String>(
            future: AppSetId.getAppSetId(), // Fetch the app set ID
            builder: (context, snapshot) {
              if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                return CircularProgressIndicator(); // Show loading indicator
              } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
                return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}'); // Handle error
              } else {
                return Text('App Set ID: ${snapshot.data}'); // Display the ID
              }
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the app
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which calls runApp() with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, a FutureBuilder is used to asynchronously fetch the app set ID.
// 4. While waiting for the ID, a CircularProgressIndicator is displayed.
// 5. If an error occurs during fetching, it displays the error message.
// 6. Once the ID is retrieved, it is displayed in the center of the screen.
