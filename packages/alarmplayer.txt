## When to Use AlarmPlayer
You might consider using the AlarmPlayer package in scenarios such as:
- Building a clock or alarm application.
- Creating reminders for tasks or events.
- Developing a meditation or relaxation app that requires timed audio playback.

## Features
- **Play Alarm Sounds**: Easily play audio files as alarms.
- **Manage Alarm States**: Control the state of alarms (set, cancel, snooze).
- **Customizable**: Supports various audio formats and allows customization of alarm settings.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS, ensuring a wide reach for your application.

With these features, AlarmPlayer provides a robust solution for developers looking to integrate alarm functionalities into their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using AlarmPlayer

## Installation
To get started with the AlarmPlayer package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  alarmplayer: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the current version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/alarmplayer).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions to allow the app to play audio in the background:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.VIBRATE"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to allow background audio playback:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>audio</string>
</array>
```

## Using AlarmPlayer
Once you have installed the package and configured your project, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set an alarm and play a sound.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:alarmplayer/alarmplayer.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  AlarmPlayer _alarmPlayer = AlarmPlayer();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the AlarmPlayer
    _alarmPlayer.init();
  }

  void _setAlarm() {
    // Set an alarm to play a sound after 5 seconds
    _alarmPlayer.setAlarm(Duration(seconds: 5), 'assets/alarm_sound.mp3');
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Alarm Player Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _setAlarm,
          child: Text('Set Alarm'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize the AlarmPlayer and set an alarm that will play a sound after 5 seconds when the button is pressed. Make sure to have an audio file named `alarm_sound.mp3` in your `assets` folder and declare it in your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/alarm_sound.mp3
```

# Complete Example of AlarmPlayer

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:alarmplayer/alarmplayer.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  AlarmPlayer _alarmPlayer = AlarmPlayer(); // Create an instance of AlarmPlayer

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _alarmPlayer.init(); // Initialize the AlarmPlayer when the widget is created
  }

  void _setAlarm() {
    // Set an alarm to play a sound after 5 seconds
    _alarmPlayer.setAlarm(Duration(seconds: 5), 'assets/alarm_sound.mp3');
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Alarm Player Example')), // App bar with title
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _setAlarm, // Set alarm when button is pressed
          child: Text('Set Alarm'), // Button text
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the initState method, we initialize the AlarmPlayer instance.
// 3. When the user presses the "Set Alarm" button, the _setAlarm method is called.
// 4. The _setAlarm method sets an alarm to play the specified sound after 5 seconds.
// 5. The alarm sound will play once the timer expires, demonstrating the functionality of the AlarmPlayer package.
