<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Context Menus Flutter Package

The `context_menus` Flutter package provides a simple and effective way to implement context menus in your Flutter applications. Context menus are essential for enhancing user experience by providing quick access to actions related to a specific item or area in the app. This package allows developers to create customizable context menus that can be triggered by long-press gestures or right-click actions.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the `context_menus` package in scenarios such as:
- **File Management Apps**: Allow users to perform actions like delete, rename, or share files by long-pressing on a file item.
- **Text Editors**: Provide options like copy, paste, or format text when users long-press on selected text.
- **Image Galleries**: Enable actions such as download, share, or delete images when users long-press on an image.

## Features

- **Customizable Menus**: Easily define the items and actions in your context menu.
- **Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Gesture Recognition**: Supports long-press and right-click gestures to trigger the context menu.
- **Flexible Design**: Customize the appearance and behavior of the context menu to fit your app's design.

With these features, the `context_menus` package is a powerful tool for enhancing interactivity in your Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Context Menus Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `context_menus` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  context_menus: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/context_menus).

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions if your context menu actions require them. For example, if you are sharing files, you might need:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to configure your app's `Info.plist` file to handle specific actions, such as sharing content. Ensure you have the appropriate permissions set.

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a context menu.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:context_menus/context_menus.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Context Menus Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ContextMenuRegion(
            child: GestureDetector(
              onLongPress: () {
                // Trigger the context menu on long press
              },
              child: Container(
                padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
                color: Colors.blue,
                child: Text('Long Press Me', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white)),
              ),
            ),
            contextMenu: ContextMenu(
              items: [
                ContextMenuItem(
                  label: 'Action 1',
                  onPressed: () {
                    // Handle Action 1
                  },
                ),
                ContextMenuItem(
                  label: 'Action 2',
                  onPressed: () {
                    // Handle Action 2
                  },
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app with a context menu that appears when the user long-presses on a blue container. The context menu contains two actions that can be customized as needed.

# Complete Example of Context Menus in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:context_menus/context_menus.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Context Menus Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ContextMenuRegion(
            child: GestureDetector(
              onLongPress: () {
                // Trigger the context menu on long press
              },
              child: Container(
                padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
                color: Colors.blue,
                child: Text('Long Press Me', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white)),
              ),
            ),
            contextMenu: ContextMenu(
              items: [
                ContextMenuItem(
                  label: 'Action 1',
                  onPressed: () {
                    // Handle Action 1
                    print('Action 1 selected');
                  },
                ),
                ContextMenuItem(
                  label: 'Action 2',
                  onPressed: () {
                    // Handle Action 2
                    print('Action 2 selected');
                  },
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, a ContextMenuRegion is created, which wraps a GestureDetector.
// 4. The GestureDetector listens for long-press gestures on the blue container.
// 5. When the user long-presses the container, the context menu is triggered.
// 6. The context menu contains two items: Action 1 and Action 2.
// 7. When an action is selected, the corresponding onPressed function is executed, printing a message to the console.
```
