# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_native_contact_picker/flutter_native_contact_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Contact Picker Example',
      home: ContactPickerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ContactPickerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ContactPickerScreenState createState() => _ContactPickerScreenState();
}

class _ContactPickerScreenState extends State<ContactPickerScreen> {
  String _contactName = 'No contact selected';

  // Function to pick a contact
  Future<void> _pickContact() async {
    // Create an instance of the contact picker
    final FlutterNativeContactPicker contactPicker = FlutterNativeContactPicker();

    // Use the contact picker to select a contact
    Contact? contact = await contactPicker.selectContact();

    // Check if a contact was selected
    if (contact != null) {
      // Update the state with the selected contact's name
      setState(() {
        _contactName = contact.fullName ?? 'No name';
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Contact Picker Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              _contactName,
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _pickContact, // Call the function to pick a contact
              child: Text('Pick a Contact'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (ContactPickerScreen).
// 3. ContactPickerScreen is a stateful widget that maintains the selected contact's name.
// 4. When the user presses the "Pick a Contact" button, the _pickContact function is called.
// 5. The _pickContact function creates an instance of FlutterNativeContactPicker and calls selectContact().
// 6. If a contact is selected, the state is updated with the contact's name, which is displayed on the screen.
```
