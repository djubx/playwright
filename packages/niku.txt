# Setting Up and Using Niku
==========================

### Step 1: Add Niku to Your Project

To use Niku, you'll need to add it to your project's `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  niku: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import Niku

In your Dart file, import Niku:

```dart
import 'package:niku/niku.dart';
```

### Step 3: Use Niku Widgets

Niku provides a range of pre-built widgets that you can use to build your application. For example, you can use the `NikuButton` widget to create a custom button:

```dart
NikuButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // Handle button press
  },
  child: Text('Click me!'),
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details

Niku is designed to work seamlessly across both Android and iOS platforms. However, you may need to make some platform-specific adjustments to get the best results.

For example, on Android, you may need to adjust the `AppBar` height to account for the status bar:

```dart
Scaffold(
  appBar: AppBar(
    title: Text('My App'),
    toolbarHeight: kToolbarHeight + MediaQuery.of(context).padding.top,
  ),
  body: // ...
)
```

On iOS, you may need to adjust the `AppBar` height to account for the notch:

```dart
Scaffold(
  appBar: AppBar(
    title: Text('My App'),
    toolbarHeight: kToolbarHeight + MediaQuery.of(context).padding.top,
  ),
  body: // ...
)
```

### Required Configurations and Optimizations

To get the best results with Niku, you may need to make some adjustments to your application's configuration and optimization settings.

For example, you can use the ` NikuTheme` widget to set a custom theme for your application:

```dart
NikuTheme(
  data: NikuThemeData(
    primaryColor: Colors.blue,
  ),
  child: // ...
)
```

You can also use the `NikuTextStyle` widget to set a custom text style for your application:

```dart
NikuTextStyle(
  style: TextStyle(
    fontSize: 18,
    fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
  ),
  child: // ...
)
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:niku/niku.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a new Niku theme
    return NikuTheme(
      data: NikuThemeData(
        primaryColor: Colors.blue,
      ),
      child: MaterialApp(
        title: 'Niku Demo',
        home: MyHomePage(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a new Niku button
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Niku Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: NikuButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Handle button press
          },
          child: Text('Click me!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// This is the main entry point of the application.
// The `MyApp` widget is created and run using the `runApp` function.
// The `MyApp` widget creates a new `NikuTheme` widget, which sets a custom theme for the application.
// The `NikuTheme` widget creates a new `MaterialApp` widget, which is the root widget of the application.
// The `MaterialApp` widget creates a new `MyHomePage` widget, which is the home page of the application.
// The `MyHomePage` widget creates a new `Scaffold` widget, which provides a basic material design layout structure.
// The `Scaffold` widget creates a new `AppBar` widget, which displays the title of the application.
// The `AppBar` widget creates a new `Text` widget, which displays the title of the application.
// The `Scaffold` widget also creates a new `Center` widget, which centers its child widget.
// The `Center` widget creates a new `NikuButton` widget, which is a custom button created using the Niku package.
// The `NikuButton` widget creates a new `Text` widget, which displays the text of the button.
// When the button is pressed, the `onPressed` callback is called, which can be used to handle the button press.
