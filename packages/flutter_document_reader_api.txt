# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Flutter Document Reader API

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_document_reader_api` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_document_reader_api` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_document_reader_api: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open the `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions added to the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

3. If you are targeting Android 10 (API level 29) or higher, you may need to add the following attribute to your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<application
    android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="true"
    ... >
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open the `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following keys to request permission for accessing files:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to read documents.</string>
<key>NSDocumentsUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your documents to read files.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the document reader functionality.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_document_reader_api/flutter_document_reader_api.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Document Reader Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: DocumentReaderHome(),
    );
  }
}

class DocumentReaderHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DocumentReaderHomeState createState() => _DocumentReaderHomeState();
}

class _DocumentReaderHomeState extends State<DocumentReaderHome> {
  // Variable to hold the document path
  String? documentPath;

  // Function to open the document picker and select a file
  void _pickDocument() async {
    // Use the document picker to select a file
    String? path = await DocumentReaderApi.pickDocument();
    if (path != null) {
      setState(() {
        documentPath = path; // Update the document path
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Document Reader'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display the selected document path
            Text(
              documentPath != null ? 'Selected Document: $documentPath' : 'No Document Selected',
              textAlign: TextAlign.center,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to pick a document
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _pickDocument,
              child: Text('Pick Document'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to read the document
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                if (documentPath != null) {
                  // Open the document reader with the selected document
                  DocumentReaderApi.openDocument(documentPath!);
                }
              },
              child: Text('Read Document'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application that uses the flutter_document_reader_api package.
// 
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The DocumentReaderHome widget is a stateful widget that manages the document selection and reading.
// 4. The _pickDocument function uses the DocumentReaderApi to open a document picker and select a file.
// 5. The selected document path is displayed on the screen.
// 6. The user can pick a document using the "Pick Document" button, which updates the state with the selected document path.
// 7. The "Read Document" button opens the selected document using the DocumentReaderApi.
// 
// This flow allows users to select a document from their device and read it within the app, showcasing the core functionality of the flutter_document_reader_api package.
```
