# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Week Day Picker

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `week_day_picker` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  week_day_picker: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Week Day Picker

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `WeekDayPicker` widget.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:week_day_picker/week_day_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Week Day Picker Example',
      home: WeekDayPickerExample(),
    );
  }
}

class WeekDayPickerExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _WeekDayPickerExampleState createState() => _WeekDayPickerExampleState();
}

class _WeekDayPickerExampleState extends State<WeekDayPickerExample> {
  // Variable to hold selected days
  List<DayOfWeek> selectedDays = [];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Week Day Picker'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: [
          // Display the selected days
          Text(
            'Selected Days: ${selectedDays.map((day) => day.toString().split('.').last).join(', ')}',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20),
          // WeekDayPicker widget
          WeekDayPicker(
            // Callback to handle day selection
            onChanged: (days) {
              setState(() {
                selectedDays = days; // Update selected days
              });
            },
            // Initial selected days
            selectedDays: selectedDays,
            // Customizing the appearance
            style: TextStyle(color: Colors.blue, fontSize: 16),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. The home of the app is set to WeekDayPickerExample, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 4. In the WeekDayPickerExample state, we maintain a list of selected days.
// 5. The build method constructs the UI, displaying the selected days and the WeekDayPicker widget.
// 6. When a user selects or deselects a day, the onChanged callback updates the selectedDays list.
// 7. The UI is rebuilt to reflect the current selection, showing the updated list of selected days.
```
