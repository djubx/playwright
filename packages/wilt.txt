# Exploring the "wilt" Flutter Package

The "wilt" package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who want to manage and manipulate state in a more efficient and intuitive way. It provides a simple yet effective way to handle state changes, making it easier to build responsive and dynamic applications. 

## When to Use "wilt"
You might consider using the "wilt" package in scenarios such as:
- When you need to manage complex state across multiple widgets.
- If you want to simplify your state management logic without introducing heavy frameworks.
- When building applications that require real-time updates and responsiveness.

## Key Features
- **Lightweight**: The package is designed to be minimalistic, ensuring that it does not bloat your application.
- **Reactive State Management**: Automatically updates the UI when the state changes, providing a seamless user experience.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate into existing Flutter applications without extensive boilerplate code.
- **Support for Multiple States**: Manage different states easily, allowing for more complex UI interactions.

Overall, "wilt" is an excellent choice for developers looking for a straightforward and effective state management solution in Flutter.

# Setting Up and Using the "wilt" Package

## Installation
To get started with the "wilt" package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  wilt: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the "wilt" package, you need to create a state class that extends `Wilt`. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:wilt/wilt.dart';

class MyState extends Wilt {
  int counter = 0;

  void increment() {
    counter++;
    notifyListeners(); // Notify listeners about the state change
  }
}
```

You can then use this state class in your Flutter widgets:

```dart
class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final myState = WiltProvider.of<MyState>(context);

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Wilt Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Counter: ${myState.counter}'),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: myState.increment,
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This setup allows you to manage the counter state and update the UI accordingly.

# Complete Example of Using the "wilt" Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:wilt/wilt.dart';

// Step 1: Create a state class that extends Wilt
class MyState extends Wilt {
  int counter = 0; // Step 2: Initialize the counter

  // Step 3: Method to increment the counter
  void increment() {
    counter++; // Increment the counter
    notifyListeners(); // Notify listeners about the state change
  }
}

// Step 4: Create the main application widget
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return WiltProvider<MyState>(
      // Step 5: Provide the state to the widget tree
      create: () => MyState(),
      child: MaterialApp(
        title: 'Wilt Example',
        home: MyHomePage(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Step 6: Create the home page widget
class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final myState = WiltProvider.of<MyState>(context); // Step 7: Access the state

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Wilt Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Counter: ${myState.counter}'), // Step 8: Display the counter
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: myState.increment, // Step 9: Increment the counter on button press
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Step 10: Explanation of the application flow
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which runs MyApp.
// 2. MyApp uses WiltProvider to create an instance of MyState and provide it to the widget tree.
// 3. MyHomePage accesses the state using WiltProvider.of<MyState>(context).
// 4. The counter value is displayed in the center of the screen.
// 5. When the FloatingActionButton is pressed, the increment method is called, updating the counter.
// 6. The UI automatically updates to reflect the new counter value due to the reactive nature of the wilt package.
