// The RealFlutter class is a stateful widget that uses the Wilt store to access and update state.
// The Wilt store is created in the RealFlutter class and is used to increment the counter value.
// The counter value is displayed in the Text widget and is updated when the button is pressed.
// The button press triggers the incrementCounter method in the Wilt store, which updates the counter value and notifies the listeners.
// The listeners are notified and the Text widget is updated with the new counter value.
