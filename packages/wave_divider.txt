# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Wave Divider Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the wave_divider package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  wave_divider: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the wave_divider package:

```dart
import 'package:wave_divider/wave_divider.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Wave Divider

You can now use the `WaveDivider` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
WaveDivider(
  height: 100, // Height of the wave
  color: Colors.blue, // Color of the wave
),
```

This will create a wave divider with a height of 100 pixels and a blue color.

# Complete Example of Using the Wave Divider Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:wave_divider/wave_divider.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Wave Divider Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Wave Divider Example'),
        ),
        body: Column(
          children: [
            // First section with some content
            Container(
              height: 300,
              color: Colors.lightBlueAccent,
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'First Section',
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.white),
                ),
              ),
            ),
            // Wave Divider
            WaveDivider(
              height: 100, // Height of the wave
              color: Colors.blue, // Color of the wave
            ),
            // Second section with some content
            Container(
              height: 300,
              color: Colors.orangeAccent,
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'Second Section',
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.white),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body consists of a Column widget that holds two Container widgets and a WaveDivider.
// 5. The first Container represents the first section with a light blue background and centered text.
// 6. The WaveDivider creates a wave effect between the two sections.
// 7. The second Container represents the second section with an orange background and centered text.
// 8. The layout is responsive, and the wave divider enhances the visual separation between the two sections.
