                },
                child: Text('Launch Settings'),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () async {
                  // Launch specific feature (e.g. camera)
                  await FlutterLaunch.launchCamera();
                },
                child: Text('Launch Camera'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user clicks on one of the buttons.
// 2. The corresponding launch method is called.
// 3. The launch method checks if the app or feature is available.
// 4. If available, the app or feature is launched.
// 5. If not available, an error message is displayed.

// In summary, this code provides a simple example of how to use the Flutter Launch package to launch apps, settings, and specific features on both Android and iOS devices.
