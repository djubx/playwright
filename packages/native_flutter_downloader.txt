```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  native_flutter_downloader: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open `AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open `Info.plist` and add the following keys to request permission for file access:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save downloaded files.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save downloaded files.</string>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to initiate a download.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:native_flutter_downloader/native_flutter_downloader.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _downloadStatus = "Download Status";

  void _startDownload() async {
    // Start a download and get the task ID
    int taskId = await NativeFlutterDownloader.enqueue(
      url: 'https://example.com/file.zip', // URL of the file to download
      savedDir: '/path/to/save', // Directory to save the file
      showNotification: true, // Show notification on download completion
      openFileFromNotification: true, // Open file from notification
    );

    // Update the status
    setState(() {
      _downloadStatus = "Downloading... Task ID: $taskId";
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Native Flutter Downloader')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text(_downloadStatus),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _startDownload,
              child: Text('Start Download'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),

# Complete Example of Native Flutter Downloader

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:native_flutter_downloader/native_flutter_downloader.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _downloadStatus = "Download Status"; // Variable to hold download status

  void _startDownload() async {
    // Start a download and get the task ID
    int taskId = await NativeFlutterDownloader.enqueue(
      url: 'https://example.com/file.zip', // URL of the file to download
      savedDir: '/path/to/save', // Directory to save the file
      showNotification: true, // Show notification on download completion
      openFileFromNotification: true, // Open file from notification
    );

    // Update the status
    setState(() {
      _downloadStatus = "Downloading... Task ID: $taskId"; // Update UI with task ID
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Native Flutter Downloader')), // App bar title
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text(_downloadStatus), // Display download status
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _startDownload, // Start download on button press
              child: Text('Start Download'), // Button text
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The _RealFlutterState class manages the state of the widget.
// 3. The _downloadStatus variable holds the current status of the download.
// 4. When the "Start Download" button is pressed, the _startDownload method is called.
// 5. Inside _startDownload, the enqueue method of NativeFlutterDownloader is called to start the download.
// 6. The URL of the file and the directory to save it are specified.
// 7. A notification is shown upon completion of the download.
// 8. The task ID is retrieved and displayed in the UI.
// 9. The app updates the UI to reflect the current download status.
