# Overview of the `read_morex` Flutter Package

The `read_morex` package is a powerful Flutter library designed to enhance text display by providing a "Read More" functionality. This package is particularly useful when you want to present long text content in a concise manner, allowing users to expand and collapse text as needed. It is ideal for applications that feature articles, blog posts, or any content that may be lengthy and requires user interaction to view the full text.

## Key Features
- **Expandable Text**: Easily toggle between truncated and full text.
- **Customizable Styles**: Modify the appearance of the text and the "Read More" link.
- **Smooth Animations**: Provides a seamless transition when expanding or collapsing text.
- **Flexible Usage**: Can be used in various widgets, making it versatile for different UI designs.

## When to Use
- When displaying articles or blog posts where the content length varies.
- In chat applications where messages can be lengthy.
- For product descriptions in e-commerce apps.

The `read_morex` package simplifies the user experience by allowing users to control how much text they want to read at a time, making it a valuable addition to any Flutter project that deals with text-heavy content.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `read_morex`

## Installation
To use the `read_morex` package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  read_morex: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Usage
### Basic Implementation
To use the `read_morex` package, you can wrap your text widget with `ReadMoreText`. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:read_morex/read_morex.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Read More Example')),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: ReadMoreText(
          'This is a long text that will be truncated. '
          'When the user clicks on "Read More", the full text will be displayed.',
          trimLines: 2, // Number of lines to show before truncating
          colorClickableText: Colors.blue,
          trimMode: TrimMode.Line,
          trimCollapsedText: '...Read More',
          trimExpandedText: ' Show Less',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Platform-Specific Details
- **Android**: No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your Flutter environment is set up correctly.
- **iOS**: Similarly, no specific configurations are needed for iOS. Ensure that you have the latest version of Xcode and Flutter.

### Optimizations
- Consider using `ReadMoreText` in a `ListView` or `Column` to manage multiple text items efficiently.
- Customize the text styles to match your app's theme for a cohesive look.

With these steps, you can easily integrate the `read_morex` package into your Flutter application and enhance the text display experience for your users.

# Complete Example of `read_morex`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:read_morex/read_morex.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Read More Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Read More Example')),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            // Displaying the ReadMoreText widget
            ReadMoreText(
              'This is a long text that will be truncated. '
              'When the user clicks on "Read More", the full text will be displayed. '
              'This allows for a cleaner UI and better user experience.',
              trimLines: 2, // Number of lines to show before truncating
              colorClickableText: Colors.blue, // Color of the clickable text
              trimMode: TrimMode.Line, // Mode of trimming
              trimCollapsedText: '...Read More', // Text when collapsed
              trimExpandedText: ' Show Less', // Text when expanded
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16), // Text style
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Spacing between widgets
            // You can add more ReadMoreText widgets here for demonstration
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp and defines the title and home widget.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget builds the main UI, including an AppBar and a body.
// 4. Inside the body, a ReadMoreText widget is created with a long text.
// 5. The ReadMoreText widget is configured to show only two lines initially.
// 6. When the user clicks "Read More", the full text is displayed, enhancing user experience.
// 7. The app is structured to allow for easy addition of more ReadMoreText widgets if needed.
