# Complete Example: Flutter Main File with `very_good_cli`

Below is a complete example of a Flutter application using the `very_good_cli` package. This example demonstrates the key features of the package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

// Main entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(const RealFlutterApp());
}

// The main application widget
class RealFlutterApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const RealFlutterApp({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // MaterialApp is the root of the application
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Very Good CLI Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: const HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

// HomePage widget which is the default screen of the app
class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  const HomePage({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Scaffold provides the basic material design visual layout structure
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: const Text('Home Page'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            const Text(
              'Welcome to the Very Good CLI Demo!',
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Navigate to the details page when the button is pressed
                Navigator.push(
                  context,
                  MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => const DetailsPage()),
                );
              },
              child: const Text('Go to Details'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// DetailsPage widget which is navigated to from the HomePage
class DetailsPage extends StatelessWidget {
  const DetailsPage({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Scaffold for the details page
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: const Text('Details Page'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: const Text(
          'This is the details page.',
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// Application Flow Explanation
// The application starts with the `main` function, which calls `runApp` to launch the `RealFlutterApp`.
// `RealFlutterApp` is a stateless widget that builds a `MaterialApp`.
// The `MaterialApp` sets up the theme and the home page, which is `HomePage`.
// `HomePage` is a stateless widget with a `Scaffold` containing an `AppBar` and a `Center` widget.
// The `Center` widget contains a `Column` with a `Text` widget and an `ElevatedButton`.
// Pressing the button navigates to `DetailsPage` using `Navigator.push`.
// `DetailsPage` is another stateless widget with a `Scaffold` and a `Text` widget displaying a message.
