# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using fc_native_image_resize

### Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `fc_native_image_resize` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  fc_native_image_resize: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/fc_native_image_resize).

### Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android Configuration

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

#### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `ios/Podfile`.
2. Uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

### Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:fc_native_image_resize/fc_native_image_resize.dart';
```

### Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the package to resize images. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to resize an image:

```dart
Future<void> resizeImage(String imagePath) async {
  // Specify the desired width and height
  int targetWidth = 300;
  int targetHeight = 300;

  // Call the resize method
  final resizedImage = await RealFlutter.resizeImage(
    imagePath: imagePath,
    width: targetWidth,
    height: targetHeight,
  );

  // Use the resized image as needed
}
```

### Step 5: Handling Permissions

For Android, ensure you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

For iOS, ensure you have the appropriate permissions in your `Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to resize images.</string>
```

### Conclusion

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the `fc_native_image_resize` package in your Flutter application effectively. This package provides a robust solution for image resizing, enhancing the performance and user experience of your app.

# Complete Example of Using fc_native_image_resize

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fc_native_image_resize/fc_native_image_resize.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Image Resize Example',
      home: ImageResizeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ImageResizeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ImageResizeScreenState createState() => _ImageResizeScreenState();
}

class _ImageResizeScreenState extends State<ImageResizeScreen> {
  String? _resizedImagePath;

  // Function to resize the image
  Future<void> _resizeImage(String imagePath) async {
    // Specify the desired width and height
    int targetWidth = 300;
    int targetHeight = 300;

    // Call the resize method
    final resizedImage = await RealFlutter.resizeImage(
      imagePath: imagePath,
      width: targetWidth,
      height: targetHeight,
    );

    // Update the state with the resized image path
    setState(() {
      _resizedImagePath = resizedImage;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Image Resize Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the resized image if available
            if (_resizedImagePath != null)
              Image.file(File(_resizedImagePath!)),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () async {
                // Here you would typically pick an image from the gallery
                // For demonstration, we use a hardcoded path
                String imagePath = 'path_to_your_image.jpg';
                await _resizeImage(imagePath);
              },
              child: Text('Resize Image'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application that uses the fc_native_image_resize package to resize images.
// 
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets the home screen to ImageResizeScreen.
// 2. The ImageResizeScreen is a stateful widget that manages the state of the resized image.
// 3. The _resizeImage function takes an image path, specifies the target dimensions, and calls the resize method from the RealFlutter class.
// 4. Upon resizing, it updates the state to display the resized image.
// 5. The UI consists of a button to trigger the image resizing process and an area to display the resized image.
// 
// Note: Replace 'path_to_your_image.jpg' with an actual image path for testing.
