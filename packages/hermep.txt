# Overview of the hermep Flutter Package

The **hermep** package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who need to manage and manipulate HTTP requests efficiently. It provides a simple and intuitive API for making network calls, handling responses, and managing errors, making it an excellent choice for applications that require robust networking capabilities.

## When to Use hermep

You should consider using the hermep package when:
- You need to perform complex HTTP requests with ease.
- You want to handle JSON serialization and deserialization seamlessly.
- You require built-in error handling and response management.
- You are looking for a lightweight solution that integrates well with Flutter's architecture.

## Key Features
- **Simple API**: The package offers a straightforward interface for making HTTP requests.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in mechanisms to handle various types of errors gracefully.
- **JSON Support**: Automatic serialization and deserialization of JSON data.
- **Customizable**: Ability to customize headers, query parameters, and request methods.
- **Asynchronous Support**: Fully supports asynchronous programming with Future and async/await.

# Setting Up and Using the hermep Package

## Installation

To get started with the hermep package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  hermep: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to access the internet. Add the following line inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you typically do not need to add any specific permissions for internet access, but ensure that your app's deployment target is set to at least iOS 9.0 in your `ios/Podfile`.

## Basic Usage

Hereâ€™s how to use the hermep package to make a simple GET request:

```dart
import 'package:hermep/hermep.dart';

class RealFlutter {
  final String baseUrl = 'https://api.example.com';

  Future<void> fetchData() async {
    try {
      // Create an instance of the Hermep client
      final client = HermepClient(baseUrl: baseUrl);
      
      // Make a GET request
      final response = await client.get('/data');

      // Check if the response is successful
      if (response.statusCode == 200) {
        // Process the response data
        print('Data: ${response.data}');
      } else {
        print('Error: ${response.statusCode}');
      }
    } catch (e) {
      print('An error occurred: $e');
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, we create an instance of `HermepClient`, make a GET request to the specified endpoint, and handle the response accordingly.

# Complete Example of Using the hermep Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:hermep/hermep.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Hermep Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  String data = 'Fetching data...'; // Initial state

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    fetchData(); // Fetch data when the widget is initialized
  }

  Future<void> fetchData() async {
    try {
      final client = HermepClient(baseUrl: 'https://api.example.com'); // Create client
      final response = await client.get('/data'); // Make GET request

      if (response.statusCode == 200) {
        setState(() {
          data = response.data; // Update state with fetched data
        });
      } else {
        setState(() {
          data = 'Error: ${response.statusCode}'; // Handle error
        });
      }
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        data = 'An error occurred: $e'; // Handle exception
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Hermep Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(data), // Display fetched data
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. HomeScreen is a stateful widget that fetches data when initialized.
// 4. In the initState method, fetchData is called to retrieve data from the API.
// 5. fetchData creates an instance of HermepClient and makes a GET request.
// 6. If the response is successful (status code 200), the state is updated with the fetched data.
// 7. If there's an error, the state is updated to reflect the error message.
// 8. The build method displays the data in the center of the screen.
