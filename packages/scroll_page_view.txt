# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Scroll Page View Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `scroll_page_view` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  scroll_page_view: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `scroll_page_view` in your app.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:scroll_page_view/scroll_page_view.dart';
```

2. Create a new widget that utilizes the `ScrollPageView`:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Scroll Page View Example')),
      body: ScrollPageView(
        children: [
          Container(color: Colors.red, child: Center(child: Text('Page 1'))),
          Container(color: Colors.green, child: Center(child: Text('Page 2'))),
          Container(color: Colors.blue, child: Center(child: Text('Page 3'))),
        ],
        // Optional: Add page indicators
        pageIndicator: PageIndicator(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Finally, run your application to see the scrollable pages in action.

With these steps, you have successfully set up and used the `scroll_page_view` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Scroll Page View

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:scroll_page_view/scroll_page_view.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Scroll Page View Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Scroll Page View Example')),
      body: ScrollPageView(
        children: [
          // Page 1: Red background with centered text
          Container(
            color: Colors.red,
            child: Center(child: Text('Page 1', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.white))),
          ),
          // Page 2: Green background with centered text
          Container(
            color: Colors.green,
            child: Center(child: Text('Page 2', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.white))),
          ),
          // Page 3: Blue background with centered text
          Container(
            color: Colors.blue,
            child: Center(child: Text('Page 3', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.white))),
          ),
        ],
        // Optional: Add page indicators
        pageIndicator: PageIndicator(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a ScrollPageView in the body.
// 4. The ScrollPageView contains three pages, each represented by a Container with a different background color and centered text.
// 5. The user can swipe between the pages, and the optional page indicators will show the current page position.
```
