# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Animated Loading Border

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the `animated_loading_border` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  animated_loading_border: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Package
You can now use the `AnimatedLoadingBorder` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_loading_border/animated_loading_border.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Animated Loading Border Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: AnimatedLoadingBorder(
            borderColor: Colors.blue,
            borderWidth: 4.0,
            duration: Duration(seconds: 2),
            child: Container(
              width: 100,
              height: 100,
              color: Colors.white,
              child: Center(child: Text('Loading...')),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, the `AnimatedLoadingBorder` wraps a simple container, providing a loading animation around it.

# Complete Example of Animated Loading Border

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_loading_border/animated_loading_border.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Animated Loading Border Example')),
        body: Center(
          // The AnimatedLoadingBorder widget is used here to show a loading animation
          child: AnimatedLoadingBorder(
            borderColor: Colors.blue, // Set the border color
            borderWidth: 4.0, // Set the border width
            duration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Set the duration of the animation
            child: Container(
              width: 100, // Width of the inner container
              height: 100, // Height of the inner container
              color: Colors.white, // Background color of the inner container
              child: Center(child: Text('Loading...')), // Centered text inside the container
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Entry point of the application
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the Flutter application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the main UI.
// 3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// 4. The AppBar displays the title of the application.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 6. The AnimatedLoadingBorder widget wraps a Container, providing a loading animation.
// 7. The border color, width, and animation duration are customizable.
// 8. The inner Container displays a loading message, which is visually enhanced by the animated border.
