# Geofence Foreground Service Flutter Package

The `geofence_foreground_service` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to implement geofencing capabilities in their applications. Geofencing allows you to define virtual boundaries around a geographical area, enabling your app to trigger events when a user enters or exits these areas. This package is particularly useful for applications that require location-based services, such as delivery apps, location tracking, and marketing applications.

## When to Use This Package
- **Location-Based Notifications**: Send alerts to users when they enter or exit specific areas.
- **Tracking User Movement**: Monitor user movements for applications like fitness tracking or delivery services.
- **Location-Based Services**: Provide services based on the user's location, such as nearby offers or services.

## Key Features
- **Foreground Service**: Runs a persistent service in the foreground to ensure geofencing works reliably.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS, with platform-specific configurations.
- **Customizable Geofences**: Easily define and manage multiple geofences with various shapes and sizes.
- **Event Handling**: Trigger events based on user location changes, such as entering or exiting a geofence.

This package is an excellent choice for developers looking to enhance their applications with location-based features while ensuring reliability and performance.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Geofence Foreground Service

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `geofence_foreground_service` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Package to Your Project
To get started, add the `geofence_foreground_service` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  geofence_foreground_service: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/geofence_foreground_service).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. **Permissions**: Add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE" />
```

2. **Service Declaration**: Declare the foreground service in the same file:

```xml
<service
    android:name="com.example.geofence_foreground_service.GeofenceService"
    android:permission="android.permission.BIND_JOB_SERVICE"
    android:foregroundServiceType="location" />
```

### iOS Configuration
1. **Permissions**: Add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to provide geofencing services.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to provide geofencing services even when the app is in the background.</string>
```

2. **Background Modes**: Enable background modes for location updates in your Xcode project settings.

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that we have set up the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to create and manage geofences.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:geofence_foreground_service/geofence_foreground_service.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the geofence service
    GeofenceForegroundService.initialize();
    // Start listening for geofence events
    GeofenceForegroundService.startListening();
  }

  // Function to create a geofence
  void _createGeofence() {
    GeofenceForegroundService.addGeofence(
      Geofence(
        id: '1',
        latitude: 37.4219983,
        longitude: -122.084,
        radius: 100,
        transitionType: GeofenceTransition.enter | GeofenceTransition.exit,
        duration: 60, // Duration in seconds
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Geofence Foreground Service')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: _createGeofence,
            child: Text('Create Geofence'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and initializes the GeofenceForegroundService.
// 2. It starts listening for geofence events.
// 3. When the user presses the "Create Geofence" button, a geofence is created with specified parameters.
// 4. The geofence will trigger events when the user enters or exits the defined area.
```
