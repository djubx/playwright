# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using lecle_downloads_path_provider

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `lecle_downloads_path_provider` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  lecle_downloads_path_provider: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/lecle_downloads_path_provider).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to write to external storage. Add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you need to add a usage description in your `Info.plist` file to inform users why your app needs access to their files:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your photo library to save downloaded files.</string>
<key>NSDocumentsDirectoryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your documents directory to save downloaded files.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to get the downloads path and save a file.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:lecle_downloads_path_provider/lecle_downloads_path_provider.dart';
import 'dart:io';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Downloads Path Provider Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: _saveFile,
            child: Text('Download File'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  Future<void> _saveFile() async {
    // Get the downloads directory
    final downloadsDirectory = await DownloadsPathProvider.downloadsPath;

    // Define the file path
    final filePath = '${downloadsDirectory}/example.txt';

    // Create a file and write some data
    final file = File(filePath);
    await file.writeAsString('Hello, this is a test file!');

    // Notify the user
    print('File saved at: $filePath');
  }
}
```

This code sets up a simple Flutter application with a button that, when pressed, saves a text file to the downloads directory.

# Complete Example of lecle_downloads_path_provider

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:lecle_downloads_path_provider/lecle_downloads_path_provider.dart';
import 'dart:io';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Downloads Path Provider Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: _saveFile, // Trigger the file saving function
            child: Text('Download File'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  Future<void> _saveFile() async {
    // Get the downloads directory
    final downloadsDirectory = await DownloadsPathProvider.downloadsPath;

    // Define the file path
    final filePath = '${downloadsDirectory}/example.txt';

    // Create a file and write some data
    final file = File(filePath);
    await file.writeAsString('Hello, this is a test file!');

    // Notify the user
    print('File saved at: $filePath');
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which builds a MaterialApp.
// 2. The app contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. In the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the _saveFile function is called.
// 5. Inside _saveFile, the downloads directory is retrieved using the DownloadsPathProvider.
// 6. A file path is defined for the new file to be saved in the downloads directory.
// 7. A new file is created, and a string is written to it.
// 8. Finally, the file path is printed to the console, confirming the file has been saved.
