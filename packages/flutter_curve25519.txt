# flutter_curve25519: A Comprehensive Overview

The `flutter_curve25519` package is a Flutter library that provides an implementation of the Curve25519 elliptic curve, which is widely used for secure key exchange and cryptographic operations. This package is particularly useful for developers looking to implement secure communication protocols in their applications, such as those found in messaging apps, secure file sharing, and other scenarios where data privacy is paramount.

## When to Use This Package
- **Secure Messaging**: When building applications that require end-to-end encryption.
- **File Sharing**: For secure file transfer between users.
- **Cryptographic Operations**: When implementing custom cryptographic protocols.

## Features
- **Key Exchange**: Facilitates secure key exchange using the Curve25519 algorithm.
- **Performance**: Optimized for performance, making it suitable for mobile applications.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that allows for quick integration into existing Flutter projects.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_curve25519

## Installation
To add the `flutter_curve25519` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_curve25519: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_curve25519).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable certain capabilities in your Xcode project, such as App Transport Security settings if you are making network requests.

## Usage
To use the `flutter_curve25519` package, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:
   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter_curve25519/flutter_curve25519.dart';
   ```

2. Generate a key pair:
   ```dart
   final keyPair = Curve25519KeyPair.generate();
   ```

3. Use the public key for secure communication:
   ```dart
   final publicKey = keyPair.publicKey;
   ```

4. Perform key exchange:
   ```dart
   final sharedSecret = Curve25519KeyPair.sharedSecret(keyPair.privateKey, otherPublicKey);
   ```

This package provides a straightforward API for performing cryptographic operations, making it easy to implement secure features in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Using flutter_curve25519

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_curve25519/flutter_curve25519.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Curve25519 Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Curve25519 Key Exchange'),
        ),
        body: KeyExchangeWidget(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class KeyExchangeWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _KeyExchangeWidgetState createState() => _KeyExchangeWidgetState();
}

class _KeyExchangeWidgetState extends State<KeyExchangeWidget> {
  String _sharedSecret = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _performKeyExchange();
  }

  void _performKeyExchange() async {
    // Generate a key pair for the local user
    final localKeyPair = Curve25519KeyPair.generate();
    
    // Simulate receiving a public key from another user
    final remoteKeyPair = Curve25519KeyPair.generate();
    
    // Perform key exchange to derive a shared secret
    final sharedSecret = Curve25519KeyPair.sharedSecret(localKeyPair.privateKey, remoteKeyPair.publicKey);
    
    // Update the state with the derived shared secret
    setState(() {
      _sharedSecret = sharedSecret.toString();
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(
      child: Text(
        'Shared Secret: $_sharedSecret',
        style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The application starts by running the RealFlutter widget, which sets up a MaterialApp.
// Inside the app, we have a KeyExchangeWidget that handles the key exchange process.
// In the initState method, we call _performKeyExchange to generate a local key pair.
// We simulate receiving a public key from a remote user by generating another key pair.
// The shared secret is derived using the local private key and the remote public key.
// Finally, we update the UI to display the derived shared secret.
