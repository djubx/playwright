# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_genius_scan

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_genius_scan` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_genius_scan: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_genius_scan).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version
    }
}
```

2. Add the required permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request camera access:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to scan documents.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save scanned documents.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to implement the scanning functionality.

<!-- END_TUTORIAL -->

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_genius_scan/flutter_genius_scan.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Genius Scan Example',
      home: ScannerPage(),
    );
  }
}

class ScannerPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ScannerPageState createState() => _ScannerPageState();
}

class _ScannerPageState extends State<ScannerPage> {
  // This function initiates the scanning process
  Future<void> _startScan() async {
    // Start the scanning process
    final result = await FlutterGeniusScan.startScan();

    // Check if the scan was successful
    if (result != null) {
      // Display the scanned document
      _showScannedDocument(result);
    }
  }

  // This function displays the scanned document
  void _showScannedDocument(String documentPath) {
    showDialog(
      context: context,
      builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
        title: Text('Scanned Document'),
        content: Image.file(File(documentPath)), // Display the scanned image
        actions: [
          TextButton(
            onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
            child: Text('Close'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Genius Scan Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _startScan, // Start scanning when button is pressed
          child: Text('Scan Document'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The ScannerPage widget is displayed, containing a button to initiate scanning.
// 3. When the button is pressed, the _startScan function is called.
// 4. The scanning process begins, and upon completion, the result is checked.
// 5. If a document is successfully scanned, the _showScannedDocument function is called.
// 6. This function displays the scanned document in an AlertDialog, allowing the user to view it.
// 7. The user can close the dialog to return to the main screen.
```
