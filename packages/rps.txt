# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the "rps" Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the "rps" package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  rps: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package
Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:rps/rps.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package
You can now use the `RealFlutter` class provided by the package to create your game interface. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set it up:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:rps/rps.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Rock Paper Scissors',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}
```

This sets up a basic Flutter application with the Rock-Paper-Scissors game interface.

# Complete Example of the "rps" Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart'; // Importing Flutter material package
import 'package:rps/rps.dart'; // Importing the rps package

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp()); // Running the main application
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Rock Paper Scissors', // Title of the app
      home: RealFlutter(), // Home widget is the RealFlutter class from rps package
    );
  }
}

// The RealFlutter class handles the game logic and UI
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String userChoice = ''; // User's choice
  String computerChoice = ''; // Computer's choice
  String result = ''; // Result of the game

  // Function to handle user's choice
  void playGame(String choice) {
    userChoice = choice; // Set user's choice
    computerChoice = getComputerChoice(); // Get computer's choice
    result = determineWinner(userChoice, computerChoice); // Determine the winner
    setState(() {}); // Update the UI
  }

  // Function to get computer's choice randomly
  String getComputerChoice() {
    final choices = ['Rock', 'Paper', 'Scissors'];
    return (choices..shuffle()).first; // Randomly select a choice
  }

  // Function to determine the winner
  String determineWinner(String user, String computer) {
    if (user == computer) {
      return 'It\'s a Tie!'; // If both choices are the same
    } else if ((user == 'Rock' && computer == 'Scissors') ||
               (user == 'Paper' && computer == 'Rock') ||
               (user == 'Scissors' && computer == 'Paper')) {
      return 'You Win!'; // User wins
    } else {
      return 'You Lose!'; // Computer wins
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Rock Paper Scissors')), // App bar title
      body: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: [
          Text('Your Choice: $userChoice', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20)), // Display user's choice
          Text('Computer Choice: $computerChoice', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20)), // Display computer's choice
          Text('Result: $result', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20)), // Display result
          Row(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              ElevatedButton(onPressed: () => playGame('Rock'), child: Text('Rock')), // Rock button
              ElevatedButton(onPressed: () => playGame('Paper'), child: Text('Paper')), // Paper button
              ElevatedButton(onPressed: () => playGame('Scissors'), child: Text('Scissors')), // Scissors button
            ],
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

/*
  Application Flow Explanation:
  1. The app starts with the MyApp class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
  2. The home widget is set to RealFlutter, which contains the game logic.
  3. The user can select Rock, Paper, or Scissors by pressing the respective button.
  4. The playGame function is called with the user's choice, which updates the state.
  5. The computer's choice is randomly generated, and the winner is determined.
  6. The UI is updated to display the user's choice, computer's choice, and the result.
