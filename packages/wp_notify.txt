# Setting Up and Using the wp_notify Package

## Installation
To get started with the `wp_notify` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and include the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  wp_notify: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the necessary permissions for internet access:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to allow network requests:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `wp_notify` package, you need to initialize it with your WordPress site URL and set up a listener for notifications. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:wp_notify/wp_notify.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: NotificationScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class NotificationScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _NotificationScreenState createState() => _NotificationScreenState();
}

class _NotificationScreenState extends State<NotificationScreen> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize wp_notify with your WordPress site URL
    WpNotify.initialize('https://yourwordpresssite.com');
    
    // Listen for notifications
    WpNotify.onNotificationReceived.listen((notification) {
      // Handle the received notification
      print('Notification received: ${notification.title}');
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('WP Notify Example')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Listening for notifications...')),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize the `wp_notify` package with the WordPress site URL and set up a listener to handle incoming notifications.

# Complete Example of wp_notify in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:wp_notify/wp_notify.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: NotificationScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class NotificationScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _NotificationScreenState createState() => _NotificationScreenState();
}

class _NotificationScreenState extends State<NotificationScreen> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize wp_notify with your WordPress site URL
    WpNotify.initialize('https://yourwordpresssite.com');
    
    // Listen for notifications
    WpNotify.onNotificationReceived.listen((notification) {
      // Handle the received notification
      print('Notification received: ${notification.title}');
      // You can also show a dialog or a snackbar to inform the user
      _showNotificationDialog(notification);
    });
  }

  // Function to show a dialog when a notification is received
  void _showNotificationDialog(Notification notification) {
    showDialog(
      context: context,
      builder: (context) {
        return AlertDialog(
          title: Text(notification.title),
          content: Text(notification.body),
          actions: [
            TextButton(
              onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
              child: Text('OK'),
            ),
          ],
        );
      },
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('WP Notify Example')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Listening for notifications...')),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a NotificationScreen as the home widget.
// 3. In the NotificationScreen's initState, we initialize the wp_notify package with the WordPress site URL.
// 4. We set up a listener for incoming notifications.
// 5. When a notification is received, we print its title and call _showNotificationDialog to display it to the user.
// 6. The _showNotificationDialog function creates an AlertDialog to show the notification details.
// 7. The build method returns a simple Scaffold with a centered text indicating that the app is listening for notifications.
