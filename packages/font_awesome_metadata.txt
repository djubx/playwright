# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `font_awesome_metadata`

## Installation
To get started with the `font_awesome_metadata` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  font_awesome_metadata: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package
Once the package is installed, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to display a Font Awesome icon:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:font_awesome_metadata/font_awesome_metadata.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Font Awesome Metadata Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Icon(
            FontAwesomeIcons.home, // Using an icon from Font Awesome
            size: 50.0,
            color: Colors.blue,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we import the necessary packages and use the `FontAwesomeIcons` class to access a specific icon. The icon is then displayed in the center of the screen.

With this setup, you can easily access and display any Font Awesome icon in your Flutter application.

  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(

        appBar: AppBar(

            // Displaying a home icon
            Icon(
              FontAwesomeIcons.home,
              size: 50.0,
              color: Colors.blue,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
            // Displaying a user icon
            Icon(
              FontAwesomeIcons.user,
              size: 50.0,
              color: Colors.green,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
            // Displaying a settings icon
            Icon(
              FontAwesomeIcons.cog,
              size: 50.0,
              color: Colors.red,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// Inside the Scaffold, we have an AppBar with the title 'Font Awesome Icons'.
// The body of the Scaffold contains a Column widget that centers its children vertically.
// We display three Font Awesome icons: home, user, and settings, each with different colors and sizes.
// The SizedBox widget is used to add space between the icons for better visual separation.
// This simple application demonstrates how to use the font_awesome_metadata package to display icons in a Flutter app.
