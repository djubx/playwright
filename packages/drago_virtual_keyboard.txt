# Setting Up and Using Drago Virtual Keyboard

## Installation
To add the **drago_virtual_keyboard** package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  drago_virtual_keyboard: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/drago_virtual_keyboard).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions and configurations. Typically, no special permissions are required for using a virtual keyboard.

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to adjust your app's settings in Xcode to ensure compatibility with the virtual keyboard. Ensure that your app supports the required iOS version.

## Basic Usage
To use the **drago_virtual_keyboard** in your Flutter application, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the package:
   ```dart
   import 'package:drago_virtual_keyboard/drago_virtual_keyboard.dart';
   ```

2. Create a widget that utilizes the virtual keyboard:
   ```dart
   class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return Scaffold(
         appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Drago Virtual Keyboard Example')),
         body: Center(
           child: DragoVirtualKeyboard(
             onKeyPress: (key) {
               // Handle key press events
               print('Key pressed: $key');
             },
           ),
         ),
       );
     }
   }
   ```

3. Run your application to see the virtual keyboard in action.

# Complete Example of Drago Virtual Keyboard

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:drago_virtual_keyboard/drago_virtual_keyboard.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Drago Virtual Keyboard Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String inputText = ''; // Variable to hold the input text

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Drago Virtual Keyboard Example')),
      body: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: [
          // Display the input text
          Text(
            inputText,
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20),
          // Add the virtual keyboard
          DragoVirtualKeyboard(
            onKeyPress: (key) {
              // Update the input text when a key is pressed
              setState(() {
                inputText += key; // Append the pressed key to the input text
              });
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains the input text state.
// 4. In the build method, it displays the current input text and the virtual keyboard.
// 5. When a key is pressed on the virtual keyboard, the onKeyPress callback is triggered.
// 6. The input text is updated by appending the pressed key, and the UI is refreshed to show the new input.
