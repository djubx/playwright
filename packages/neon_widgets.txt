# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Neon Widgets

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **neon_widgets** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  neon_widgets: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions or configurations in your `Info.plist` file, depending on the widgets you are using. For example, if you are using any features that require internet access, ensure you have:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the package to start using the neon widgets:

```dart
import 'package:neon_widgets/neon_widgets.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using Neon Widgets

You can now use the neon widgets in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use a neon button:

```dart
NeonButton(
  onTap: () {
    // Action when the button is tapped
  },
  child: Text('Click Me'),
  glowColor: Colors.blueAccent,
  textColor: Colors.white,
);
```

This button will have a glowing effect with a blue accent color. You can customize the glow color, text color, and other properties as needed.

With these steps, you are now ready to integrate neon widgets into your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Neon Widgets

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:neon_widgets/neon_widgets.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Neon Widgets Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: NeonHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class NeonHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Neon Widgets Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Neon Text Widget
            NeonText(
              'Welcome to Neon Widgets!',
              fontSize: 30,
              glowColor: Colors.green,
              textColor: Colors.white,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Neon Button Widget
            NeonButton(
              onTap: () {
                // Action when the button is tapped
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Neon Button Pressed!')),
                );
              },
              child: Text('Click Me'),
              glowColor: Colors.blueAccent,
              textColor: Colors.white,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp has a title and a theme, and it sets NeonHomePage as the home widget.
// 4. NeonHomePage is a StatelessWidget that builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the NeonText and NeonButton vertically.
// 6. The NeonText widget displays a welcome message with a glowing green effect.
// 7. The NeonButton widget triggers a SnackBar message when pressed, demonstrating interactivity.
