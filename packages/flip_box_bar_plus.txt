# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Flip Box Bar Plus

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flip_box_bar_plus: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flip_box_bar_plus).

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your `ios/Podfile` has the platform set to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flip_box_bar_plus/flip_box_bar_plus.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Flip Box Bar
You can now use the `FlipBoxBarPlus` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
FlipBoxBarPlus(
  items: [
    FlipBoxItem(
      front: Text('Front 1'),
      back: Text('Back 1'),
    ),
    FlipBoxItem(
      front: Text('Front 2'),
      back: Text('Back 2'),
    ),
  ],
  onTap: (index) {
    print('Tapped on item $index');
  },
)
```

This code creates a flip box bar with two items. Each item has a front and back view, and tapping on an item will print the index of the tapped item.

              ),
            ],
            onTap: (index) {
