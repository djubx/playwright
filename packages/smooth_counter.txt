Here's a detailed technical blog on the "smooth_counter" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Smooth Counter Flutter Package

The **smooth_counter** package is a Flutter library designed to create smooth and animated counters. It provides a visually appealing way to display numerical values that change over time, making it ideal for applications that require dynamic data representation, such as dashboards, statistics, or any app that needs to show real-time updates.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the **smooth_counter** package in scenarios such as:
- Displaying live statistics (e.g., user counts, sales figures).
- Animating score changes in games.
- Showing progress in tasks or loading states.

## Features

- **Smooth Animations**: The package provides smooth transitions between numbers, enhancing user experience.
- **Customizable**: You can customize the duration of the animation, the curve of the animation, and the formatting of the displayed number.
- **Easy Integration**: The package is easy to integrate into existing Flutter applications with minimal setup.

## Example Use Cases

1. **Dashboard Widgets**: Use smooth counters to display metrics like total users, sales, or other KPIs.
2. **Game Scoreboards**: Animate score changes in real-time as players score points.
3. **Progress Indicators**: Show progress in tasks or loading states with animated counters.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Smooth Counter

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the **smooth_counter** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  smooth_counter: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:smooth_counter/smooth_counter.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using Smooth Counter in Your Widget

You can now use the `SmoothCounter` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
SmoothCounter(
  value: 100, // Initial value
  duration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Duration of the animation
  curve: Curves.easeInOut, // Animation curve
  textStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 40, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold), // Custom text style
)
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your `ios/Podfile` has the platform version set to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Optimizations

- **Performance**: Use the `SmoothCounter` widget in a way that minimizes rebuilds. For example, wrap it in a `StatefulWidget` and update the value only when necessary.
- **Testing**: Test the animations on both Android and iOS devices to ensure smooth performance across platforms.

# Complete Example of Smooth Counter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:smooth_counter/smooth_counter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Smooth Counter Example',
      home: CounterScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class CounterScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CounterScreenState createState() => _CounterScreenState();
}

class _CounterScreenState extends State<CounterScreen> {
  // Variable to hold the counter value
  int _counterValue = 0;

  // Method to increment the counter
  void _incrementCounter() {
    setState(() {
      _counterValue += 1; // Increment the counter value
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Smooth Counter Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // SmoothCounter widget displaying the counter value
            SmoothCounter(
              value: _counterValue, // Current counter value
              duration: Duration(seconds: 1), // Animation duration
              curve: Curves.easeInOut, // Animation curve
              textStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 50, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold), // Text style
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between counter and button
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _incrementCounter, // Increment counter on button press
              child: Text('Increment Counter'), // Button text
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (CounterScreen).
// 3. CounterScreen is a StatefulWidget that maintains the counter value.
// 4. The _incrementCounter method updates the counter value when the button is pressed.
// 5. The SmoothCounter widget displays the current counter value with a smooth animation.
// 6. When the button is pressed, the counter value increments, triggering a rebuild and updating the displayed value smoothly.
```
