                ],
              );

              // Add the pass to the wallet
              AddToWallet.addPass(pass); // Call the method to add the pass
            },
            child: Text('Add Pass to Wallet'), // Button text
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with a MaterialApp widget that contains a Scaffold.
// 2. An AppBar is created with the title 'Add to Wallet Example'.
// 3. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 4. An ElevatedButton is displayed, which, when pressed, creates a new Pass object.
// 5. The Pass object is configured with primary fields (name and balance) and a barcode.
// 6. The AddToWallet.addPass(pass) method is called to add the pass to the user's wallet.
// 7. The button allows users to easily add their pass to their digital wallet with a single tap.
