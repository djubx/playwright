# Overview of the dart_mpd Package

The `dart_mpd` package is a Dart client for the Music Player Daemon (MPD), which is a flexible, powerful server-side application for playing music. This package allows Flutter developers to interact with MPD servers, enabling them to build music player applications with ease. 

## When to Use `dart_mpd`
You should consider using `dart_mpd` when you want to create a music player app that requires:
- Remote control of music playback.
- Access to a music library stored on a server.
- Support for various audio formats and streaming capabilities.

## Key Features
- **Connection Management**: Easily connect and disconnect from MPD servers.
- **Playback Control**: Play, pause, stop, and skip tracks.
- **Library Access**: Browse and manage the music library.
- **Playlist Management**: Create, modify, and delete playlists.
- **Metadata Retrieval**: Fetch metadata for current and upcoming tracks.

With these features, `dart_mpd` provides a robust foundation for building music-related applications in Flutter.

# Setting Up and Using dart_mpd

## Installation
To add the `dart_mpd` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dart_mpd: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
Ensure that your Android project has internet permissions. Open `AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following line inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to configure your app's `Info.plist` to allow network requests. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `dart_mpd` package, you need to create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class, which will handle the connection to the MPD server and manage playback.

### Example Code
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to connect to an MPD server and control playback:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dart_mpd/dart_mpd.dart';

class RealFlutter {
  MPDClient client;

  RealFlutter(String host, int port) {
    client = MPDClient(host: host, port: port);
  }

  Future<void> connect() async {
    await client.connect();
  }

  Future<void> play() async {
    await client.play();
  }

  Future<void> pause() async {
    await client.pause();
  }

  Future<void> stop() async {
    await client.stop();
  }

  Future<List<MPDTrack>> getPlaylist() async {
    return await client.playlist();
  }
}
```

In this example, the `RealFlutter` class connects to an MPD server and provides methods to control playback and retrieve the playlist.

# Complete Example of Using dart_mpd

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dart_mpd/dart_mpd.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'MPD Player',
      home: MPDPlayer(),
    );
  }
}

class MPDPlayer extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MPDPlayerState createState() => _MPDPlayerState();
}

class _MPDPlayerState extends State<MPDPlayer> {
  RealFlutter mpdClient;
  List<MPDTrack> playlist = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the MPD client with server details
    mpdClient = RealFlutter('localhost', 6600);
    // Connect to the MPD server
    _connectToServer();
  }

  Future<void> _connectToServer() async {
    await mpdClient.connect();
    // Fetch the playlist after connecting
    _fetchPlaylist();
  }

  Future<void> _fetchPlaylist() async {
    // Get the current playlist from the server
    playlist = await mpdClient.getPlaylist();
    setState(() {}); // Update the UI with the new playlist
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('MPD Player'),
      ),
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: playlist.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return ListTile(
            title: Text(playlist[index].title),
            onTap: () {
              // Play the selected track
              mpdClient.play();
            },
          );
        },
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          // Pause playback when the button is pressed
          mpdClient.pause();
        },
        child: Icon(Icons.pause),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```
// The above code creates a simple MPD player application.
// 1. The `main` function initializes the app and sets `MyApp` as the home widget.
// 2. `MPDPlayer` is a stateful widget that manages the connection to the MPD server.
// 3. In `initState`, we create an instance of `RealFlutter` with the server's address and port.
// 4. `_connectToServer` method connects to the MPD server and fetches the playlist.
// 5. The `build` method constructs the UI, displaying the playlist in a ListView.
// 6. Each track in the playlist is clickable, and tapping it will play the track.
// 7. A FloatingActionButton is provided to pause playback when pressed.
// 8. The UI updates automatically when the playlist is fetched or modified.
