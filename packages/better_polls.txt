# Setting Up and Using the better_polls Package

## Installation
To get started with the `better_polls` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  better_polls: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions if you plan to collect user data:
   ```xml
   <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your photo library to share poll results.</string>
   ```

## Basic Usage
To create a simple poll, you can use the `PollWidget` provided by the package. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to implement it in your Flutter app:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:better_polls/better_polls.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: PollScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PollScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Poll Example')),
      body: PollWidget(
        question: 'What is your favorite programming language?',
        options: ['Dart', 'JavaScript', 'Python', 'Java'],
        onVote: (String selectedOption) {
          // Handle the vote submission
          print('User voted for: $selectedOption');
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a simple poll asking users about their favorite programming language. The `onVote` callback handles the user's selection.

# Complete Example of the better_polls Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:better_polls/better_polls.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: PollScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PollScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Poll Example')),
      body: PollWidget(
        question: 'What is your favorite programming language?',
        options: ['Dart', 'JavaScript', 'Python', 'Java'],
        onVote: (String selectedOption) {
          // Handle the vote submission
          print('User voted for: $selectedOption');
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which is the main entry point.
// 2. The PollScreen widget is displayed, containing a poll question and options.
// 3. The PollWidget is initialized with a question and a list of options.
// 4. When a user selects an option, the onVote callback is triggered.
// 5. The selected option is printed to the console, which can be replaced with logic to store the vote or update the UI.
