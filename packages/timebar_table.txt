# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the timebar_table Package

## Installation
To get started with the `timebar_table` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  timebar_table: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `timebar_table` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:timebar_table/timebar_table.dart';
```

You can then create a simple time bar table by using the `TimeBarTable` widget. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
TimeBarTable(
  data: [
    TimeBarData(start: DateTime.now(), end: DateTime.now().add(Duration(hours: 1)), label: 'Event 1'),
    TimeBarData(start: DateTime.now().add(Duration(hours: 1)), end: DateTime.now().add(Duration(hours: 2)), label: 'Event 2'),
  ],
)
```

This will create a time bar table with two events. You can customize the appearance and behavior further as per your requirements.

# Complete Example of Using timebar_table

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:timebar_table/timebar_table.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'TimeBar Table Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('TimeBar Table Example'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: TimeBarTable(
            // Providing a list of time bar data
            data: [
              TimeBarData(
                start: DateTime.now(),
                end: DateTime.now().add(Duration(hours: 1)),
                label: 'Event 1',
              ),
              TimeBarData(
                start: DateTime.now().add(Duration(hours: 1)),
                end: DateTime.now().add(Duration(hours: 2)),
                label: 'Event 2',
              ),
              TimeBarData(
                start: DateTime.now().add(Duration(hours: 2)),
                end: DateTime.now().add(Duration(hours: 3)),
                label: 'Event 3',
              ),
            ],
            // Customizing the appearance of the time bars
            barColor: Colors.blue,
            labelStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the Flutter application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'TimeBar Table Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is a Padding widget that adds space around the TimeBarTable.
// 5. The TimeBarTable widget is populated with a list of TimeBarData objects, each representing an event with a start time, end time, and label.
// 6. The appearance of the time bars is customized using the barColor and labelStyle properties.
// 7. The app displays a simple time bar table with three events, each spanning one hour.
