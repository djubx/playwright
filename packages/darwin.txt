// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The `main` function is called, which creates a new instance of the `ModuleRegistry` class.
// 2. The `RealFlutterModule` is added to the `ModuleRegistry`.
// 3. The `MyApp` widget is created and run using the `runApp` function.
// 4. The `MyApp` widget builds a `MaterialApp` with a `Scaffold` and an `AppBar`.
// 5. The `RealFlutterComponent` is injected into the `RealFlutterModule` using the `@Inject` annotation.
// 6. The `RealFlutterComponent` is used to configure the `RealFlutterModule`.

// The benefits of using the Darwin package in this example are:
// 1. The application is broken down into smaller, independent modules that can be easily managed and maintained.
// 2. The dependency injection system makes it easy to manage dependencies between modules and components.
// 3. The event management system enables developers to handle events and notifications in a centralized and efficient manner.
