# Overview of the Firestore Size Flutter Package

The `firestore_size` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers who need to manage and monitor the size of their Firestore databases. This package provides a straightforward way to calculate the size of documents and collections in Firestore, which is essential for optimizing database usage and managing costs effectively.

## When to Use This Package
- **Cost Management**: Understanding the size of your Firestore data can help you manage costs, especially when dealing with large datasets.
- **Performance Optimization**: By monitoring the size of your collections, you can make informed decisions about data structure and indexing.
- **Data Migration**: When migrating data, knowing the size can help in planning and execution.

## Key Features
- **Document Size Calculation**: Easily calculate the size of individual documents.
- **Collection Size Calculation**: Get the total size of all documents within a collection.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Monitor size changes in real-time as data is added or removed.

This package is particularly useful for applications that rely heavily on Firestore for data storage and require insights into data size for performance and cost management.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Firestore Size

## Installation
To use the `firestore_size` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  firestore_size: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/firestore_size).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21.
2. Add the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` if required by your app.

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and ensure you have the necessary configurations for Firebase.
2. Make sure to initialize Firebase in your `AppDelegate.swift` or `AppDelegate.m` file.

## Usage
After installation, you can start using the package in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s how to initialize and use the `firestore_size` package:

```dart
import 'package:cloud_firestore/cloud_firestore.dart';
import 'package:firestore_size/firestore_size.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await Firebase.initializeApp();
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

In your application, you can now calculate the size of documents and collections as follows:

```dart
// Example of calculating document size
final documentSize = await FirestoreSize.getDocumentSize('collection/documentId');

// Example of calculating collection size
final collectionSize = await FirestoreSize.getCollectionSize('collection');
```

This setup allows you to easily monitor and manage the size of your Firestore data.

# Complete Example of Using Firestore Size

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cloud_firestore/cloud_firestore.dart';
import 'package:firestore_size/firestore_size.dart';

void main() async {
  // Ensure Flutter binding is initialized
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  // Initialize Firebase
  await Firebase.initializeApp();
  // Run the Flutter app
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Firestore Size Example',
      home: FirestoreSizeExample(),
    );
  }
}

class FirestoreSizeExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _FirestoreSizeExampleState createState() => _FirestoreSizeExampleState();
}

class _FirestoreSizeExampleState extends State<FirestoreSizeExample> {
  // Variables to hold sizes
  int documentSize = 0;
  int collectionSize = 0;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Fetch sizes when the widget is initialized
    fetchSizes();
  }

  // Function to fetch document and collection sizes
  Future<void> fetchSizes() async {
    // Get the size of a specific document
    documentSize = await FirestoreSize.getDocumentSize('your_collection/your_document');
    // Get the total size of a collection
    collectionSize = await FirestoreSize.getCollectionSize('your_collection');
    // Update the state to reflect the new sizes
    setState(() {});
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Firestore Size Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Document Size: $documentSize bytes'),
            Text('Collection Size: $collectionSize bytes'),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: fetchSizes, // Refresh sizes on button press
              child: Text('Refresh Sizes'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, initializing Firebase and running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds the MaterialApp and sets FirestoreSizeExample as the home widget.
// 3. In FirestoreSizeExample, the initState method calls fetchSizes to get the sizes of the document and collection.
// 4. The fetchSizes method uses the FirestoreSize package to get the sizes and updates the state.
// 5. The UI displays the sizes and provides a button to refresh the sizes, allowing users to see real-time updates.
