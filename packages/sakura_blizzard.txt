```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sakura_blizzard/sakura_blizzard.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sakura Blizzard Demo',
      home: SakuraBlizzardDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class SakuraBlizzardDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SakuraBlizzardDemoState createState() => _SakuraBlizzardDemoState();
}

class _SakuraBlizzardDemoState extends State<SakuraBlizzardDemo> {
  // Create a Sakura Blizzard instance with custom settings
  final _sakuraBlizzard = SakuraBlizzard(
    snowflakeDesign: SnowflakeDesign.flake1,
    snowflakeSize: 20,
    snowfallSpeed: 5,
    snowfallDensity: 10,
  );

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Sakura Blizzard Demo'),
      ),
      body: Stack(
        children: [
          // Add the Sakura Blizzard widget to the stack
          _sakuraBlizzard,
          Center(
            child: Text(
              'Hello, World!',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The `RealFlutter` widget is created and run as the main app.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` widget builds a `MaterialApp` with a `SakuraBlizzardDemo` widget as its home.
// 3. The `SakuraBlizzardDemo` widget creates a `SakuraBlizzard` instance with custom settings.
// 4. The `SakuraBlizzardDemo` widget builds a `Scaffold` with an `AppBar` and a `Stack` as its body.
// 5. The `Stack` contains the `SakuraBlizzard` widget and a `Center` widget with a `Text` child.
// 6. The `SakuraBlizzard` widget creates a snowfall effect with the specified design, size, speed, and density.
// 7. The snowfall effect is displayed behind the `Text` widget.
