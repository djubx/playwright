# Tutorial: Setting Up Firebase UI OAuth Google in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the steps to set up the `firebase_ui_oauth_google` package in a Flutter application. 

## Step 1: Add Dependencies

First, add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  firebase_core: ^latest_version
  firebase_auth: ^latest_version
  firebase_ui_oauth_google: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the packages.

## Step 2: Configure Firebase

### For Android

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Create a new project or select an existing one.
3. Add an Android app to your project and follow the instructions to download the `google-services.json` file.
4. Place the `google-services.json` file in the `android/app` directory.
5. Update your `android/build.gradle` file to include the Google services classpath:

   ```groovy
   buildscript {
       dependencies {
           // Add this line
           classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.10'
       }
   }
   ```

6. In your `android/app/build.gradle`, apply the Google services plugin:

   ```groovy
   apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
   ```

### For iOS

1. In the Firebase Console, add an iOS app and download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file.
2. Place the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file in the `ios/Runner` directory.
3. Open your `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode and ensure that the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file is included in your project.
4. Add the following to your `ios/Podfile`:

   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   use_frameworks!
   ```

## Step 3: Initialize Firebase

In your `main.dart` file, initialize Firebase before running the app:

```dart
import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await Firebase.initializeApp();
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 4: Implement Google Sign-In

Now, you can use the `firebase_ui_oauth_google` package to implement Google sign-in in your app. 

```dart
import 'package:firebase_ui_oauth_google/firebase_ui_oauth_google.dart';

// Use this in your widget tree where you want to show the sign-in button
GoogleSignInButton(
  onPressed: () async {
    // Handle sign-in logic here
  },
);
```

With these steps, you should have a basic setup for using Google authentication in your Flutter app.

# Complete Example of Firebase UI OAuth Google in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';
import 'package:firebase_auth/firebase_auth.dart';
import 'package:firebase_ui_oauth_google/firebase_ui_oauth_google.dart';

void main() async {
  // Ensure that Flutter bindings are initialized
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  
  // Initialize Firebase
  await Firebase.initializeApp();
  
  // Run the app
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Firebase UI OAuth Google Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: SignInScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class SignInScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Sign In'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: GoogleSignInButton(
          onPressed: () async {
            try {
              // Trigger the Google sign-in process
              final UserCredential userCredential = await GoogleSignInApi.signIn();
              
              // Check if the user is signed in
              if (userCredential.user != null) {
                // Navigate to the home screen
                Navigator.pushReplacement(
                  context,
                  MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => HomeScreen(user: userCredential.user)),
                );
              }
            } catch (e) {
              // Handle sign-in errors
              print('Sign-in failed: $e');
            }
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final User? user;

  HomeScreen({required this.user});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Welcome, ${user?.displayName}'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('You are signed in as ${user?.email}'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, initializing Firebase and running the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds the MaterialApp with a title and theme, setting SignInScreen as the home.
// 3. In SignInScreen, a GoogleSignInButton is displayed. When pressed, it triggers the Google sign-in process.
// 4. If the sign-in is successful, the user is navigated to HomeScreen, displaying their name and email.
// 5. If an error occurs during sign-in, it is caught and printed to the console.
