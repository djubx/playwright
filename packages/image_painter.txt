# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Image Painter Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the image_painter package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  image_painter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/image_painter).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add permissions for accessing the photo library if your app requires it. Open your `Info.plist` file and add:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to edit images.</string>
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:image_painter/image_painter.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Image Painter

You can now use the `ImagePainter` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set it up:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:image_painter/image_painter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Image Painter Example')),
        body: ImagePainter(
          // Add your image and configuration here
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This basic setup will create a simple application with an image painter. You can customize the `ImagePainter` widget with various parameters to suit your needs.

# Complete Example of Image Painter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:image_painter/image_painter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Image Painter Example'),
        ),
        body: ImagePainter(
          // The image to be painted on
          image: AssetImage('assets/sample_image.png'), // Load your image here
          // Configuration options
          brushColor: Colors.red, // Set the brush color
          brushSize: 5.0, // Set the brush size
          // Enable undo/redo functionality
          enableUndo: true,
          enableRedo: true,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The MaterialApp widget is created, providing the basic structure of the app.
// 3. A Scaffold widget is used to create the app's layout, including an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The ImagePainter widget is instantiated in the body, where you can specify the image to be painted on, brush color, and size.
// 5. The user can interact with the canvas to draw on the image, and the undo/redo functionality allows them to manage their actions easily.
```

// The application flow is straightforward: it initializes a Flutter app with a drawing canvas where users can paint on a specified image. The `ImagePainter` widget handles all the drawing logic, allowing users to customize their experience with brush color and size. The app is structured to provide a seamless user experience, making it easy to create interactive image editing applications.
