class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Modal Bottom Sheet Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              showFlexibleBottomSheet(
                context: context,
                builder: (context, controller, offset) {
                  return Container(
                    height: 300,
                    color: Colors.white,
                    child: Center(child: Text('Hello from Bottom Sheet!')),
                  );
                },
              );
            },
            child: Text('Show Bottom Sheet'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

                            // Close the bottom sheet when this button is pressed
                            Navigator.pop(context);
                          },
                          child: Text('Close'),
                        ),
                      ],
                    ),
                  );
                },
              );
            },
            child: Text('Show Bottom Sheet'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, there's an AppBar and a Center widget containing an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the showFlexibleBottomSheet function is called.
// 5. The bottom sheet is displayed with a height of 300 pixels and a white background.
// 6. Inside the bottom sheet, there's a text message and another button to close the sheet.
// 7. Pressing the "Close" button pops the bottom sheet off the stack, returning to the main screen.
