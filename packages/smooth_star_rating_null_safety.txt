  allowHalfRating: true, // Allows half-star ratings
  onRated: (value) {

    print("Rating: $value");
  },
  starCount: 5, // Total number of stars
  rating: 3.5, // Initial rating
  size: 40.0, // Size of the stars
  isReadOnly: false, // Set to true if you want to disable user interaction
  color: Colors.yellow, // Color of the filled stars
  borderColor: Colors.grey, // Color of the unfilled stars
  spacing: 0.0, // Space between stars
),
```

# Complete Example of Smooth Star Rating Null Safety

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:smooth_star_rating_null_safety/smooth_star_rating.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Smooth Star Rating Example',
      home: RatingPage(),
    );
  }
}

class RatingPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RatingPageState createState() => _RatingPageState();
}

class _RatingPageState extends State<RatingPage> {
  double rating = 3.0; // Initial rating value

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Smooth Star Rating Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display the SmoothStarRating widget
            SmoothStarRating(
              allowHalfRating: true, // Allow half-star ratings
              onRated: (value) {
                // Update the rating state when the user rates
                setState(() {
                  rating = value; // Update the rating value
                });
                print("Rating: $value"); // Print the rating value
              },
              starCount: 5, // Total number of stars
              rating: rating, // Current rating
              size: 40.0, // Size of the stars
              isReadOnly: false, // Allow user interaction
              color: Colors.yellow, // Color of filled stars
              borderColor: Colors.grey, // Color of unfilled stars
              spacing: 0.0, // Space between stars
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Add space between the rating and text
            Text(
              'Your Rating: $rating', // Display the current rating
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20), // Text style
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home page (RatingPage).
// 3. RatingPage is a StatefulWidget that maintains the current rating state.
// 4. The build method of _RatingPageState creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a SmoothStarRating widget is displayed, allowing users to rate.
// 6. When a user taps on the stars, the onRated callback updates the rating state and prints the value.
// 7. The current rating is displayed below the star rating, updating in real-time as the user interacts.
```
