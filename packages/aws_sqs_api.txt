# Overview of the aws_sqs_api Flutter Package

The `aws_sqs_api` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to integrate Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) into their applications. SQS is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. This package provides a straightforward API to interact with SQS, allowing developers to send, receive, and delete messages from queues seamlessly.

## When to Use This Package
- **Microservices Architecture**: When building applications that rely on microservices, SQS can help manage communication between services.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: If your application requires background processing of tasks, SQS can queue these tasks for later processing.
- **Decoupling Components**: Use SQS to decouple components of your application, allowing them to operate independently.

## Key Features
- **Send Messages**: Easily send messages to an SQS queue.
- **Receive Messages**: Retrieve messages from the queue for processing.
- **Delete Messages**: Remove messages from the queue after processing.
- **Visibility Timeout**: Manage the visibility timeout for messages to ensure they are not processed multiple times.
- **Batch Operations**: Support for batch sending and receiving of messages to optimize performance.

# Setting Up the aws_sqs_api Package

To get started with the `aws_sqs_api` package, follow these steps:

## Step 1: Add Dependency
Add the `aws_sqs_api` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  aws_sqs_api: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/aws_sqs_api).

## Step 2: Configure AWS Credentials
You need to configure your AWS credentials to use the SQS service. This can be done in several ways:

### For Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21 // or higher
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add your AWS credentials in the `AndroidManifest.xml`:
   ```xml
   <meta-data
       android:name="com.amazonaws.sdk.credentials"
       android:value="YOUR_AWS_CREDENTIALS" />
   ```

### For iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add your AWS credentials:
   ```xml
   <key>AWSCredentials</key>
   <string>YOUR_AWS_CREDENTIALS</string>
   ```

2. Ensure you have the necessary permissions in your `Podfile`:
   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

## Step 3: Import the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:
```dart
import 'package:aws_sqs_api/aws_sqs_api.dart';
```

## Step 4: Initialize the SQS Client
You can initialize the SQS client in your application as follows:
```dart
final sqs = SQS(region: 'your-region', credentials: AwsClientCredentials(accessKey: 'your-access-key', secretKey: 'your-secret-key'));
```

Now you are ready to use the `aws_sqs_api` package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Using aws_sqs_api

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:aws_sqs_api/aws_sqs_api.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'AWS SQS Example',
      home: SQSExample(),
    );
  }
}

class SQSExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SQSExampleState createState() => _SQSExampleState();
}

class _SQSExampleState extends State<SQSExample> {
  final sqs = SQS(region: 'your-region', credentials: AwsClientCredentials(accessKey: 'your-access-key', secretKey: 'your-secret-key'));
  String message = '';

  // Function to send a message to the SQS queue
  Future<void> sendMessage(String messageBody) async {
    final response = await sqs.sendMessage(
      queueUrl: 'your-queue-url',
      messageBody: messageBody,
    );
    print('Message sent: ${response.messageId}');
  }

  // Function to receive messages from the SQS queue
  Future<void> receiveMessages() async {
    final response = await sqs.receiveMessage(
      queueUrl: 'your-queue-url',
      maxNumberOfMessages: 1,
    );

    if (response.messages != null && response.messages!.isNotEmpty) {
      setState(() {
        message = response.messages!.first.body!;
      });
      // Delete the message after processing
      await sqs.deleteMessage(
        queueUrl: 'your-queue-url',
        receiptHandle: response.messages!.first.receiptHandle!,
      );
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('AWS SQS Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Received Message: $message'),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                sendMessage('Hello from Flutter!');
              },
              child: Text('Send Message'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                receiveMessages();
              },
              child: Text('Receive Message'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and home set to SQSExample.
// 3. In the SQSExample stateful widget, we initialize the SQS client with AWS credentials.
// 4. The sendMessage function sends a message to the specified SQS queue and prints the message ID.
// 5. The receiveMessages function retrieves messages from the queue, updates the UI with the received message, and deletes it from the queue.
// 6. The UI consists of two buttons: one to send a message and another to receive messages, displaying the received message in the center of the screen.
