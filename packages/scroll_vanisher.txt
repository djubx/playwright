# Setting Up and Using `scroll_vanisher`

## Installation
To get started with the `scroll_vanisher` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  scroll_vanisher: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/scroll_vanisher).

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `scroll_vanisher` package, you will typically wrap your scrollable widget with the `ScrollVanisher` widget. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:scroll_vanisher/scroll_vanisher.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Scroll Vanisher Example')),
      body: ScrollVanisher(
        child: ListView.builder(
          itemCount: 100,
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            return ListTile(title: Text('Item $index'));
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `ScrollVanisher` widget will manage the visibility of its child based on the scroll position.

# Complete Example of `scroll_vanisher`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:scroll_vanisher/scroll_vanisher.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Scroll Vanisher Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Scroll Vanisher Example')),
      body: ScrollVanisher(
        // The ScrollVanisher widget wraps around the ListView
        child: ListView.builder(
          itemCount: 100, // Number of items in the list
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            return ListTile(title: Text('Item $index')); // Each item in the list
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets MyApp as the root widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body contains a ScrollVanisher widget that wraps a ListView.builder.
// 5. The ListView.builder generates a list of 100 items, each represented by a ListTile.
// 6. As the user scrolls through the list, the ScrollVanisher manages the visibility of its child based on the scroll position, enhancing the user experience.
