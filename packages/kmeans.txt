# KMeans Flutter Package: A Comprehensive Overview

The **kmeans** Flutter package is a powerful tool for implementing the K-Means clustering algorithm in your Flutter applications. K-Means is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning a dataset into distinct groups based on feature similarity. This package is particularly useful for developers looking to perform clustering tasks, such as customer segmentation, image compression, or any scenario where grouping data points is beneficial.

## When to Use KMeans
- **Data Analysis**: When you need to analyze and group large datasets.
- **Image Processing**: For tasks like color quantization in images.
- **Recommendation Systems**: To cluster users or items based on preferences.

## Key Features
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to add to your Flutter project.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Allows you to set the number of clusters and other parameters.
- **Efficient Performance**: Optimized for speed and memory usage.

With its straightforward API and robust functionality, the kmeans package is an excellent choice for Flutter developers looking to incorporate clustering capabilities into their applications.

# KMeans Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the kmeans package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  kmeans: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
The kmeans package is designed to work seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms. There are no additional configurations required for either platform, making it easy to integrate into your existing Flutter applications.

## Basic Usage
To use the kmeans package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:kmeans/kmeans.dart';
```

You can then create an instance of the KMeans class and use its methods to perform clustering on your data.

### Example Code Snippet
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the kmeans package:

```dart
// Create a KMeans instance
final kmeans = KMeans(k: 3); // Specify the number of clusters

// Sample data points
final data = [
  [1.0, 2.0],
  [1.5, 1.8],
  [5.0, 8.0],
  [8.0, 8.0],
  [1.0, 0.6],
  [9.0, 11.0],
];

// Fit the model to the data
final result = kmeans.fit(data);

// Access the cluster centers
print('Cluster Centers: ${result.centroids}');
```

This code initializes a KMeans instance with 3 clusters, fits it to a set of data points, and prints the resulting cluster centers.

With this setup, you are ready to start clustering your data using the kmeans package in your Flutter applications!

# Complete Example of KMeans in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:kmeans/kmeans.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'KMeans Example',
      home: KMeansHome(),
    );
  }
}

class KMeansHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _KMeansHomeState createState() => _KMeansHomeState();
}

class _KMeansHomeState extends State<KMeansHome> {
  List<List<double>> data = [
    [1.0, 2.0],
    [1.5, 1.8],
    [5.0, 8.0],
    [8.0, 8.0],
    [1.0, 0.6],
    [9.0, 11.0],
  ];

  List<List<double>>? centroids;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _performKMeans();
  }

  void _performKMeans() {
    // Create a KMeans instance with 3 clusters
    final kmeans = KMeans(k: 3);
    
    // Fit the model to the data
    final result = kmeans.fit(data);
    
    // Update the centroids state
    setState(() {
      centroids = result.centroids;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('KMeans Clustering Example'),
      ),
      body: centroids == null
          ? Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator()) // Show loading indicator
          : ListView.builder(
              itemCount: centroids!.length,
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                // Display each centroid
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text('Centroid ${index + 1}: ${centroids![index]}'),
                );
              },
            ),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
// Explanation of the application flow:

// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home page (KMeansHome).
// 3. In the KMeansHome widget, we define a list of data points to be clustered.
// 4. The initState method is overridden to call _performKMeans when the widget is first created.
// 5. The _performKMeans method creates an instance of KMeans with 3 clusters and fits it to the data.
// 6. After fitting, it updates the centroids state with the resulting cluster centers.
// 7. The build method checks if centroids are null (indicating loading) and shows a CircularProgressIndicator.
// 8. Once the centroids are available, it displays them in a ListView, with each centroid shown in a ListTile.
