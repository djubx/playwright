# FuzzyWuzzy Flutter Package: An Overview

The `fuzzywuzzy` Flutter package is a powerful tool for developers looking to implement fuzzy string matching in their applications. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to compare strings and determine their similarity, even if they are not exactly the same. This can be incredibly beneficial in applications involving search functionalities, data cleaning, or any feature that requires approximate string matching.

## When to Use FuzzyWuzzy

- **Search Functionality**: Enhance search features by allowing users to find results even with typos or slight variations in the search query.
- **Data Cleaning**: Identify and merge duplicate records in datasets where entries may have slight differences.
- **User Input Validation**: Validate user inputs against a set of known values, even if the input is not an exact match.

## Features

- **Ratio Matching**: Calculate the similarity between two strings as a percentage.
- **Partial Ratio**: Compare substrings within longer strings to find partial matches.
- **Token Sort Ratio**: Tokenize strings, sort them, and then compare, which is useful for strings with the same words in different orders.
- **Token Set Ratio**: Similar to Token Sort Ratio but handles duplicate words more effectively.

# Setting Up and Using FuzzyWuzzy in Flutter

In this section, we'll walk through the process of setting up the `fuzzywuzzy` package in a Flutter project and demonstrate how to use its features effectively.

## Setup Process

1. **Add Dependency**: First, add the `fuzzywuzzy` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     fuzzywuzzy: ^0.1.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run `flutter pub get` to install the new package.

3. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the package to start using it.

   ```dart
   import 'package:fuzzywuzzy/fuzzywuzzy.dart';
   ```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

- Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid compatibility issues.

  ```gradle
  defaultConfig {
      minSdkVersion 21
  }
  ```

### iOS

- No specific configurations are required for iOS, but ensure your deployment target is set to a version that supports all necessary Flutter features.

## Using FuzzyWuzzy

Here's a simple example of how to use the `fuzzywuzzy` package in your Flutter application:

```dart
void main() {
  final realFlutter = RealFlutter();
  print(realFlutter.calculateSimilarity("flutter", "fluter"));
}

class RealFlutter {
  int calculateSimilarity(String str1, String str2) {
    return ratio(str1, str2);
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a `RealFlutter` class with a method `calculateSimilarity` that uses the `ratio` function from the `fuzzywuzzy` package to calculate the similarity between two strings.

# Complete Example: Flutter Application Using FuzzyWuzzy

Below is a complete Flutter application demonstrating the key features of the `fuzzywuzzy` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fuzzywuzzy/fuzzywuzzy.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'FuzzyWuzzy Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: FuzzyWuzzyDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class FuzzyWuzzyDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _FuzzyWuzzyDemoState createState() => _FuzzyWuzzyDemoState();
}

class _FuzzyWuzzyDemoState extends State<FuzzyWuzzyDemo> {
  final TextEditingController _controller1 = TextEditingController();
  final TextEditingController _controller2 = TextEditingController();
  String _result = '';

  void _calculateSimilarity() {
    // Get the text from the input fields
    final str1 = _controller1.text;
    final str2 = _controller2.text;

    // Calculate the similarity using the ratio function
    final similarity = ratio(str1, str2);

    // Update the result state
    setState(() {
      _result = 'Similarity: $similarity%';
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('FuzzyWuzzy String Matching'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: <Widget>[
            TextField(
              controller: _controller1,
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'First String'),
            ),
            TextField(
              controller: _controller2,
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Second String'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _calculateSimilarity,
              child: Text('Calculate Similarity'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(
              _result,
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `MyApp` widget.
// `MyApp` is a stateless widget that sets up the MaterialApp and its theme.
// The home of the app is `FuzzyWuzzyDemo`, a stateful widget that manages the input and output of the string similarity calculation.
// Two `TextEditingController` objects are used to capture user input for the strings to be compared.
// The `_calculateSimilarity` method uses the `ratio` function from the `fuzzywuzzy` package to compute the similarity percentage between the two input strings.
// The result is displayed on the screen using a `Text` widget, which updates whenever the similarity is recalculated.
