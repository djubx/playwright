# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Easy Formz Inputs

## Installation
To get started with `easy_formz_inputs`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  easy_formz_inputs: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/easy_formz_inputs).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package
Once you have installed the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a form with validation using `easy_formz_inputs`.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:easy_formz_inputs/easy_formz_inputs.dart';
```

2. Create a form using the provided input widgets and manage the state using Formz.

This will be demonstrated in the complete example section below.

# Complete Example: Building a Simple Form with Easy Formz Inputs

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:easy_formz_inputs/easy_formz_inputs.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Easy Formz Inputs Example',
      home: FormExample(),
    );
  }
}

class FormExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _FormExampleState createState() => _FormExampleState();
}

class _FormExampleState extends State<FormExample> {
  // Create a GlobalKey to manage the form state
  final _formKey = GlobalKey<FormState>();
  
  // Define controllers for the input fields
  final _nameController = TextEditingController();
  final _emailController = TextEditingController();

  // Method to handle form submission
  void _submitForm() {
    if (_formKey.currentState!.validate()) {
      // If the form is valid, display a snackbar
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Form submitted successfully!')),
      );
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Easy Formz Inputs Example')),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Form(
          key: _formKey, // Assign the GlobalKey to the Form
          child: Column(
            children: [
              // Name input field
              EasyTextFormField(
                controller: _nameController,
                validator: (value) {
                  // Validate name input
                  if (value == null || value.isEmpty) {
                    return 'Please enter your name';
                  }
                  return null;
                },
                decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Name'),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 16),
              // Email input field
              EasyTextFormField(
                controller: _emailController,
                validator: (value) {
                  // Validate email input
                  if (value == null || !RegExp(r'^[^@]+@[^@]+\.[^@]+').hasMatch(value)) {
                    return 'Please enter a valid email';
                  }
                  return null;
                },
                decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Email'),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Submit button
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _submitForm,
                child: Text('Submit'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget (FormExample).
// 3. FormExample is a StatefulWidget that manages the form state.
// 4. A GlobalKey is created to manage the form's state and validation.
// 5. Two TextEditingControllers are defined for the name and email input fields.
// 6. The _submitForm method validates the form and shows a snackbar on successful submission.
// 7. The build method constructs the UI, including the form with input fields and a submit button.
// 8. Each input field uses EasyTextFormField for easy validation and state management.
// 9. When the submit button is pressed, the _submitForm method is called to validate and process the form.
