  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the `PannableRatingBar` widget in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement it in your widget tree.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_pannable_rating_bar/flutter_pannable_rating_bar.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Pannable Rating Bar Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: PannableRatingBar(
            initialRating: 3.0, // Set the initial rating
            minRating: 1.0, // Minimum rating
            maxRating: 5.0, // Maximum rating
            onRatingChanged: (rating) {
              // Handle the rating change
              print('New rating: $rating');
            },
            itemCount: 5, // Number of items in the rating bar
            itemSize: 40.0, // Size of each item
            unratedColor: Colors.grey, // Color for unrated items
            ratedColor: Colors.amber, // Color for rated items
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application with a pannable rating bar in the center of the screen. The `onRatingChanged` callback allows you to handle the rating changes in real-time.

# Complete Example of flutter_pannable_rating_bar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_pannable_rating_bar/flutter_pannable_rating_bar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Pannable Rating Bar Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: PannableRatingBar(
            initialRating: 3.0, // Set the initial rating to 3
            minRating: 1.0, // Minimum rating allowed
            maxRating: 5.0, // Maximum rating allowed
            onRatingChanged: (rating) {
              // This callback is triggered when the rating changes
              print('New rating: $rating'); // Print the new rating to the console
            },
            itemCount: 5, // Total number of rating items (stars)
            itemSize: 40.0, // Size of each rating item
            unratedColor: Colors.grey, // Color for unrated items (stars)
            ratedColor: Colors.amber, // Color for rated items (stars)
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Pannable Rating Bar Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers a PannableRatingBar widget.
// 5. The PannableRatingBar is initialized with a starting rating of 3, allowing ratings from 1 to 5.
// 6. When the user interacts with the rating bar, the onRatingChanged callback is triggered, printing the new rating to the console.
// 7. The appearance of the rating bar is customizable with item size and colors for rated and unrated items.
