# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Select Card Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the **select_card** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  select_card: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:select_card/select_card.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Select Card Widget
You can now use the `SelectCard` widget in your application. Below is a simple example of how to implement it.

### Platform-Specific Details
- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid compatibility issues.
- **iOS**: No specific configurations are required, but ensure that your deployment target is set to a version that supports Flutter.

### Example Usage
Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to use the `SelectCard` widget:

```dart
SelectCard(
  title: 'Option 1',
  subtitle: 'This is the first option',
  isSelected: true,
  onTap: () {
    // Handle card tap
  },
),
```

This code creates a selectable card with a title and subtitle. The `isSelected` property determines if the card is currently selected, and the `onTap` callback is triggered when the card is tapped.

# Complete Example of Using the Select Card Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:select_card/select_card.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Select Card Example',
      home: SelectCardDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class SelectCardDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SelectCardDemoState createState() => _SelectCardDemoState();
}

class _SelectCardDemoState extends State<SelectCardDemo> {
  // Variable to keep track of the selected card
  int selectedCardIndex = -1;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Select Card Demo'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Creating a list of selectable cards
          Expanded(
            child: ListView.builder(
              itemCount: 3, // Number of cards
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                return SelectCard(
                  title: 'Option ${index + 1}', // Card title
                  subtitle: 'This is option number ${index + 1}', // Card subtitle
                  isSelected: selectedCardIndex == index, // Check if this card is selected
                  onTap: () {
                    // Update the selected card index when tapped
                    setState(() {
                      selectedCardIndex = index;
                    });
                  },
                );
              },
            ),
          ),
          // Displaying the selected option
          Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
            child: Text(
              selectedCardIndex != -1
                  ? 'You selected Option ${selectedCardIndex + 1}'
                  : 'No option selected',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget (SelectCardDemo).
// 3. SelectCardDemo is a stateful widget that maintains the state of the selected card.
// 4. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a ListView of SelectCards.
// 5. Each SelectCard displays an option and checks if it is selected based on the selectedCardIndex.
// 6. When a card is tapped, the selectedCardIndex is updated, and the UI is rebuilt to reflect the selection.
// 7. Below the list of cards, a Text widget displays the currently selected option or indicates that no option is selected.
