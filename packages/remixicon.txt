# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using RemixIcon

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the RemixIcon package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the RemixIcon package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  remixicon: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the RemixIcon package:

```dart
import 'package:remixicon/remixicon.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using Icons in Your Application

You can now use the icons in your Flutter widgets. Hereâ€™s an example of how to use a RemixIcon in a `Container` widget:

```dart
Container(
  child: Icon(
    Remix.home_2_line, // Using the home icon from RemixIcon
    size: 50.0, // Setting the size of the icon
    color: Colors.blue, // Setting the color of the icon
  ),
)
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Customizing Icons

You can customize the icons further by changing their size and color dynamically based on your app's theme or user preferences.

```dart
Icon(
  Remix.settings_2_line,
  size: 30.0, // Custom size
  color: Theme.of(context).primaryColor, // Using theme color
)
```

With these steps, you are now ready to use the RemixIcon package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Using RemixIcon

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:remixicon/remixicon.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'RemixIcon Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('RemixIcon Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Displaying a home icon
            Icon(
              Remix.home_2_line,
              size: 100.0, // Setting the size of the icon
              color: Colors.blue, // Setting the color of the icon
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
            // Displaying a settings icon
            Icon(
              Remix.settings_2_line,
              size: 100.0, // Setting the size of the icon
              color: Colors.green, // Setting the color of the icon
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
            // Displaying a user icon
            Icon(
              Remix.user_3_line,
              size: 100.0, // Setting the size of the icon
              color: Colors.red, // Setting the color of the icon
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of the MaterialApp is set to HomePage, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 4. The HomePage widget builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the icons vertically.
// 6. Each Icon widget uses RemixIcon's icons, with specified sizes and colors.
// 7. The SizedBox widget is used to add spacing between the icons for better visual separation.
```
