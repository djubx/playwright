# Setting Up and Using the Flutter Lyric Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the `flutter_lyric` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_lyric: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` to allow for audio playback. Add the following key:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for karaoke features.</string>
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_lyric/flutter_lyric.dart';
```

## Step 4: Basic Usage
You can now use the `RealFlutter` class to display lyrics. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set it up:

```dart
RealFlutter(
  lyrics: [
    LyricLine(time: Duration(seconds: 0), text: "Hello, it's me"),
    LyricLine(time: Duration(seconds: 5), text: "I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet"),
    // Add more lyrics as needed
  ],
  onLyricChanged: (lyric) {
    print("Current Lyric: $lyric");
  },
);
```

This setup will display the lyrics and print the current lyric to the console whenever it changes.

In conclusion, the `flutter_lyric` package is straightforward to set up and provides a robust solution for displaying lyrics in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Using the Flutter Lyric Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_lyric/flutter_lyric.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Lyric Example',
      home: LyricScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class LyricScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _LyricScreenState createState() => _LyricScreenState();
}

class _LyricScreenState extends State<LyricScreen> {
  // List of lyrics with their corresponding timestamps
  final List<LyricLine> lyrics = [
    LyricLine(time: Duration(seconds: 0), text: "Hello, it's me"),
    LyricLine(time: Duration(seconds: 5), text: "I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet"),
    LyricLine(time: Duration(seconds: 10), text: "To go over everything"),
    // Add more lyrics as needed
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Lyric Display'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: RealFlutter(
          lyrics: lyrics,
          onLyricChanged: (lyric) {
            // This callback is triggered when the lyric changes
            print("Current Lyric: $lyric");
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets MyApp as the root widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (LyricScreen).
// 3. LyricScreen is a stateful widget that holds the lyrics data.
// 4. The lyrics are defined as a list of LyricLine objects, each with a timestamp and text.
// 5. The build method of LyricScreen returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a centered RealFlutter widget.
// 6. The RealFlutter widget takes the lyrics list and a callback function that prints the current lyric to the console when it changes.
// 7. As the audio plays, the lyrics will be displayed and updated in sync with the playback.
```
