# flutter_radar Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To add the `flutter_radar` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_radar: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_radar).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No specific configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if you plan to use any features that require user permissions.

## Basic Usage
To use the `flutter_radar` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_radar/flutter_radar.dart';
```

You can then create a radar chart by using the `RadarChart` widget. Below is a simple example of how to set it up.

# Complete Example of flutter_radar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_radar/flutter_radar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Radar Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Radar Chart Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: RadarChart(
            data: [
              // Data for the radar chart
              RadarData(
                label: 'Category A',
                values: [5, 3, 4, 2, 4],
                color: Colors.blue,
              ),
              RadarData(
                label: 'Category B',
                values: [4, 2, 5, 3, 3],
                color: Colors.red,
              ),
            ],
            // Define the attributes for the radar chart
            attributes: ['Attribute 1', 'Attribute 2', 'Attribute 3', 'Attribute 4', 'Attribute 5'],
            // Set the maximum value for the radar chart
            maxValue: 5,
            // Customize the chart appearance
            chartStyle: RadarChartStyle(
              backgroundColor: Colors.white,
              gridColor: Colors.grey,
              labelColor: Colors.black,
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The AppBar displays the title "Radar Chart Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers the RadarChart.
// 5. The RadarChart is created with two sets of data (Category A and Category B) and their respective values.
// 6. The attributes for the radar chart are defined, along with the maximum value.
// 7. The chartStyle is customized to enhance the visual appearance of the radar chart.
