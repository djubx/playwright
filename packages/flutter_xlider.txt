# Flutter Xlider: A Comprehensive Overview

The `flutter_xlider` package is a powerful and flexible slider widget for Flutter applications. It allows developers to create customizable sliders that can handle a range of values, making it ideal for applications that require user input for numerical values, such as volume controls, brightness adjustments, or any other settings that can be represented as a range.

# Setting Up and Using Flutter Xlider

## Installation

To get started with `flutter_xlider`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_xlider: ^3.4.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage

To use `flutter_xlider`, you can create a simple slider in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_xlider/flutter_xlider.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Xlider Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: FlutterSlider(
          values: [50], // Initial value
          max: 100, // Maximum value
          min: 0, // Minimum value
          onDragging: (handlerIndex, lowerValue, upperValue) {
            // Handle value changes
            print('Current value: $lowerValue');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple slider that allows users to select a value between 0 and 100. The `onDragging` callback is used to print the current value to the console whenever the slider is moved.

# Complete Example of Flutter Xlider

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_xlider/flutter_xlider.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Xlider Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: FlutterSlider(
            values: [50], // Initial value set to 50
            max: 100, // Maximum value of the slider
            min: 0, // Minimum value of the slider
            onDragging: (handlerIndex, lowerValue, upperValue) {
              // This callback is triggered when the slider is dragged
              print('Current value: $lowerValue'); // Print the current value
            },
            // Customizing the appearance of the slider
            trackBar: FlutterSliderTrackBar(
              activeTrackBar: BoxDecoration(
                color: Colors.blue, // Active track color
              ),
              inactiveTrackBar: BoxDecoration(
                color: Colors.grey, // Inactive track color
              ),
            ),
            handler: FlutterSliderHandler(
              decoration: BoxDecoration(
                color: Colors.red, // Handler color
                shape: BoxShape.circle, // Handler shape
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the `RealFlutter` class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The `MaterialApp` widget is used to create a basic app structure.
// 3. Inside the `Scaffold`, an AppBar is created with the title 'Flutter Xlider Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a centered `FlutterSlider` widget.
// 5. The slider is initialized with a value of 50, with a range from 0 to 100.
// 6. The `onDragging` callback prints the current value to the console whenever the slider is moved.
// 7. The appearance of the slider is customized with active and inactive track colors and a circular handler.
```
