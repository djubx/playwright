# Part 2: Tutorial

## Setup Process

To get started with the `particles_fly` package, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `particles_fly` package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     particles_fly: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

     ```groovy
     android {
         ...
         defaultConfig {
             ...
             minSdkVersion 21
         }
     }
     ```

   - **iOS**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and ensure you have the necessary permissions if your particle effects require any specific capabilities.

4. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the package:

   ```dart
   import 'package:particles_fly/particles_fly.dart';
   ```

## Using the Package

To use the `particles_fly` package, you can create a simple widget that utilizes the particle effects. Here’s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:particles_fly/particles_fly.dart';

class ParticleDemo extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Particles Fly Demo')),
      body: Center(
        child: ParticlesFly(
          particleCount: 100, // Number of particles
          particleColor: Colors.blue, // Color of particles
          particleSize: 5.0, // Size of each particle
          duration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Duration of the effect
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code creates a simple Flutter application that displays a particle effect in the center of the screen. You can customize the `particleCount`, `particleColor`, `particleSize`, and `duration` to achieve the desired effect.

# Part 3: Complete Example

Here’s a complete example of a Flutter application using the `particles_fly` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:particles_fly/particles_fly.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Particles Fly Example',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: ParticleDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class ParticleDemo extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Particles Fly Demo')),
      body: Center(
        child: ParticlesFly(
          particleCount: 100, // Number of particles to display
          particleColor: Colors.blue, // Color of the particles
          particleSize: 5.0, // Size of each particle
          duration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Duration for which particles are displayed
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to ParticleDemo, which is another StatelessWidget.
// 4. In ParticleDemo, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a body.
// 5. The body contains a Center widget that centers the ParticlesFly widget.
// 6. The ParticlesFly widget is configured with 100 particles, blue color, size of 5.0, and a duration of 2 seconds.
// 7. When the app runs, it displays the particle effect in the center of the screen for the specified duration.
```
