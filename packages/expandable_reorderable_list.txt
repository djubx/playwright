# Expandable Reorderable List Flutter Package

The `expandable_reorderable_list` package is a powerful Flutter widget that allows developers to create lists that can be expanded and reordered dynamically. This package is particularly useful for applications that require a flexible and interactive user interface, such as task management apps, note-taking applications, or any scenario where users need to organize items in a list format.

## Features
- **Expandable Items**: Each item in the list can be expanded to reveal more content, making it easy to display additional information without cluttering the UI.
- **Reorderable Functionality**: Users can easily reorder items in the list through drag-and-drop gestures, enhancing the interactivity of the application.
- **Customizable**: The package allows for extensive customization of the list items, including styling and behavior, to fit the needs of your application.

## When to Use
- When you need a list that can display additional details without navigating away from the main view.
- In applications where users need to frequently rearrange items, such as to-do lists or project management tools.
- For creating dynamic forms where sections can be expanded or collapsed based on user input.

The `expandable_reorderable_list` package is a great choice for developers looking to enhance user experience through interactive and flexible list management.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Expandable Reorderable List

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started with the `expandable_reorderable_list` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  expandable_reorderable_list: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/expandable_reorderable_list).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:expandable_reorderable_list/expandable_reorderable_list.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Expandable Reorderable List
You can now use the `ExpandableReorderableList` widget in your application. Below is a simple example of how to implement it.

# Complete Example of Expandable Reorderable List

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:expandable_reorderable_list/expandable_reorderable_list.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Expandable Reorderable List Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Expandable Reorderable List'),
        ),
        body: ExpandableReorderableList(
          children: [
            // Each item in the list is an ExpandableReorderableItem
            ExpandableReorderableItem(
              key: ValueKey(1),
              header: ListTile(
                title: Text('Item 1'),
              ),
              expanded: Column(
                children: [
                  ListTile(title: Text('Detail 1')),
                  ListTile(title: Text('Detail 2')),
                ],
              ),
            ),
            ExpandableReorderableItem(
              key: ValueKey(2),
              header: ListTile(
                title: Text('Item 2'),
              ),
              expanded: Column(
                children: [
                  ListTile(title: Text('Detail A')),
                  ListTile(title: Text('Detail B')),
                ],
              ),
            ),
            // Add more items as needed
          ],
          onReorder: (oldIndex, newIndex) {
            // Handle the reordering logic here
            print('Moved item from $oldIndex to $newIndex');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an ExpandableReorderableList is created with two items.
// 4. Each item is an ExpandableReorderableItem that has a header and an expanded section.
// 5. The onReorder callback is triggered when an item is dragged and dropped to a new position.
// 6. The app displays a list where users can expand items to see more details and reorder them as needed.
