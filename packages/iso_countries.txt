# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:iso_countries/iso_countries.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'ISO Countries Example',
      home: CountryListScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class CountryListScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Fetching all countries using the iso_countries package
    List<Country> countries = IsoCountries.getAllCountries();

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Country List'),
      ),
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: countries.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          // Displaying each country in the list
          return ListTile(
            title: Text(countries[index].name), // Country name
            subtitle: Text(countries[index].code), // Country ISO code
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The home screen is CountryListScreen, which displays a list of countries.
// 4. In CountryListScreen, we fetch all countries using IsoCountries.getAllCountries().
// 5. A ListView.builder is used to create a scrollable list of countries.
// 6. Each ListTile displays the country name and its ISO code, providing a simple and effective UI.
