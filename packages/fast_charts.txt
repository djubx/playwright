# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Fast Charts

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **fast_charts** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  fast_charts: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:fast_charts/fast_charts.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using Fast Charts

You can now use the **fast_charts** package to create charts in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to create a line chart.

```dart
LineChart(
  data: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
  labels: ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May'],
  title: 'Monthly Sales',
);
```

This code snippet creates a line chart representing monthly sales data.

# Complete Example of Fast Charts

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fast_charts/fast_charts.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Fast Charts Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Fast Charts Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: LineChart(
            data: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50],
            labels: ['Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri'],
            title: 'Weekly Sales',
            lineColor: Colors.blue,
            pointColor: Colors.red,
            showPoints: true,
            animationDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 500),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The above code sets up a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the fast_charts package.
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Fast Charts Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers a LineChart widget.
// 5. The LineChart displays data for weekly sales, with specified colors for the line and points.
// 6. The chart is animated over 500 milliseconds for a smooth transition when displayed.
```
