# Tutorial: Setting Up the Responsive Navigation Bar

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `responsive_navigation_bar` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `responsive_navigation_bar` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  responsive_navigation_bar: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the responsive navigation bar.

# Complete Example of Responsive Navigation Bar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:responsive_navigation_bar/responsive_navigation_bar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Responsive Navigation Bar Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  // Variable to keep track of the selected index
  int _selectedIndex = 0;

  // List of pages to navigate to
  final List<Widget> _pages = [
    Center(child: Text('Home Page')),
    Center(child: Text('Search Page')),
    Center(child: Text('Profile Page')),
  ];

  // Method to handle navigation
  void _onItemTapped(int index) {
    setState(() {
      _selectedIndex = index; // Update the selected index
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Responsive Navigation Bar'),
      ),
      body: _pages[_selectedIndex], // Display the selected page
      bottomNavigationBar: ResponsiveNavigationBar(
        items: [
          NavigationBarItem(
            icon: Icons.home,
            label: 'Home',
          ),
          NavigationBarItem(
            icon: Icons.search,
            label: 'Search',
          ),
          NavigationBarItem(
            icon: Icons.person,
            label: 'Profile',
          ),
        ],
        currentIndex: _selectedIndex, // Set the current index
        onTap: _onItemTapped, // Handle item tap
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. The HomeScreen is the main screen of the app, which contains a bottom navigation bar.
// 4. The _selectedIndex variable keeps track of the currently selected tab.
// 5. The _pages list contains the widgets to display for each tab.
// 6. The _onItemTapped method updates the selected index when a tab is tapped.
// 7. The Scaffold widget contains an AppBar and a body that displays the selected page based on the current index.
// 8. The ResponsiveNavigationBar widget is used to create the bottom navigation bar, which is responsive and adapts to screen size.
