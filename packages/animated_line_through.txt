# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Animated Line Through

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `animated_line_through` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  animated_line_through: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `animated_line_through` package in your app.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:animated_line_through/animated_line_through.dart';
```

2. Use the `AnimatedLineThrough` widget in your widget tree:

```dart
AnimatedLineThrough(
  duration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Animation duration
  lineColor: Colors.blue, // Color of the line
  lineWidth: 4.0, // Width of the line
  child: Text('Animating Line Through Text'), // Widget to animate through
)
```

With these steps, you can easily integrate the `animated_line_through` package into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Animated Line Through

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_line_through/animated_line_through.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animated Line Through Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Animated Line Through Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: AnimatedLineThrough(
            duration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Set the duration of the animation
            lineColor: Colors.blue, // Set the color of the line
            lineWidth: 4.0, // Set the width of the line
            child: Text(
              'Animating Line Through Text',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24), // Style for the text
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, the AnimatedLineThrough widget is used.
// 5. The AnimatedLineThrough widget animates a line through the provided text.
// 6. The animation lasts for 2 seconds, with a blue line of width 4.0.
// 7. The text "Animating Line Through Text" is displayed in the center of the screen.
// 8. When the app runs, the line will animate through the text, creating a visually appealing effect.
