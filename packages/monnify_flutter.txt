import 'package:monnify_flutter/monnify_flutter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Monnify Payment')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Initialize Monnify with your API key
              MonnifyFlutter.initialize(apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY');

              // Start the payment process
              MonnifyFlutter.startPayment(
                amount: 1000, // Amount in Naira
                currency: 'NGN',
                reference: 'unique_reference',
                onPaymentSuccess: (response) {
                  // Handle successful payment
                  print('Payment Successful: $response');
                },
                onPaymentFailure: (error) {
                  // Handle payment failure
                  print('Payment Failed: $error');
                },
              );
            },
            child: Text('Pay Now'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code initializes the Monnify payment gateway and starts the payment process when the button is pressed. Make sure to replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your actual Monnify API key.

                reference: 'unique_reference',
                onPaymentSuccess: (response) {
                  // Handle successful payment
                  print('Payment Successful: $response');
                },
                onPaymentFailure: (error) {
                  // Handle payment failure
                  print('Payment Failed: $error');
                },
              );
            },
            child: Text('Pay Now'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with a MaterialApp widget that contains a Scaffold.
// 2. An AppBar is created with the title 'Monnify Payment'.
// 3. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 4. An ElevatedButton is displayed with the text 'Pay Now'.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the Monnify payment gateway is initialized with the provided API key.
// 6. The payment process is started with the specified amount, currency, and a unique reference.
// 7. If the payment is successful, the success callback is triggered, and the response is printed.
// 8. If the payment fails, the failure callback is triggered, and the error is printed.
