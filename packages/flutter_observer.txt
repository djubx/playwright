# Flutter Observer Package Overview

The `flutter_observer` package is a powerful tool for developers looking to monitor and manage the lifecycle of their Flutter applications. It provides a streamlined way to observe and react to changes in the app's state, making it particularly useful for debugging, analytics, and performance monitoring.

## When to Use `flutter_observer`

- **Debugging**: Track the lifecycle of your app to identify and fix bugs related to state changes.
- **Analytics**: Collect data on how users interact with your app by observing state transitions.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Identify performance bottlenecks by monitoring state changes and their impact on app performance.

## Key Features

- **Lifecycle Observation**: Monitor the app's lifecycle events such as startup, pause, resume, and exit.
- **Custom Event Tracking**: Define and track custom events within your app.
- **Integration with Existing Code**: Easily integrate with existing Flutter projects without major refactoring.
- **Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

# Setting Up and Using `flutter_observer`

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_observer` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter project.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

First, add the `flutter_observer` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_observer: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

No additional configuration is required for Android. Ensure your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, ensure your `Podfile` is using platform version 10.0 or higher:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Implementing `flutter_observer`

To use `flutter_observer`, you need to wrap your `MaterialApp` with the `RealFlutter` class provided by the package. This allows you to observe lifecycle events and custom events.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_observer/flutter_observer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter(
    child: MyApp(),
  ));
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Observer Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Observing Events

You can observe events by implementing the `Observer` interface and overriding the `onEvent` method:

```dart
class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> implements Observer {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    RealFlutter.addObserver(this);
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    RealFlutter.removeObserver(this);
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  void onEvent(ObserverEvent event) {
    print('Event observed: ${event.name}');
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to Flutter Observer Demo!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_observer/flutter_observer.dart';

void main() {
  // The entry point of the application, wrapping the app with RealFlutter
  runApp(RealFlutter(
    child: MyApp(),
  ));
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Building the main MaterialApp widget
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Observer Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> implements Observer {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Adding this class as an observer to listen for events
    RealFlutter.addObserver(this);
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Removing this class as an observer when the widget is disposed
    RealFlutter.removeObserver(this);
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  void onEvent(ObserverEvent event) {
    // Handling observed events
    print('Event observed: ${event.name}');
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Building the UI of the HomeScreen
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to Flutter Observer Demo!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow:
// 1. The application starts by running the main function, which initializes the app with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter wraps the MyApp widget, enabling lifecycle observation.
// 3. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with HomeScreen as the home widget.
// 4. HomeScreen is a stateful widget that implements the Observer interface.
// 5. In initState, HomeScreen adds itself as an observer to RealFlutter.
// 6. The onEvent method is called whenever an event is observed, printing the event name to the console.
// 7. When HomeScreen is disposed, it removes itself as an observer to prevent memory leaks.
