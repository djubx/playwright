// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app, which displays the MyHomePage widget.
// 2. The user can interact with the app, which uses the classes and functions defined in the barrel file.
// 3. The barrel file is generated automatically by the build_runner, so the user doesn't need to worry about it.
// 4. The app continues to run, using the classes and functions defined in the barrel file as needed.
// 5. The user can close the app at any time.
