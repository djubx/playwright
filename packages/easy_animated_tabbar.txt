```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:easy_animated_tabbar/easy_animated_tabbar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Current index of the selected tab
  int _currentIndex = 0;

  // List of tabs
  final List<Widget> _tabs = [
    Center(child: Text('Home')),
    Center(child: Text('Search')),
    Center(child: Text('Profile')),
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Easy Animated TabBar Example'),
        ),
        body: _tabs[_currentIndex], // Display the current tab
        bottomNavigationBar: EasyAnimatedTabBar(
          // List of tab items
          tabItems: [
            TabItem(text: 'Home', icon: Icons.home),
            TabItem(text: 'Search', icon: Icons.search),
            TabItem(text: 'Profile', icon: Icons.person),
          ],
          // Current index of the selected tab
          currentIndex: _currentIndex,
          // Callback when a tab is tapped
          onTap: (index) {
            setState(() {
              _currentIndex = index; // Update the current index
            });
          },
          // Customize the tab bar appearance
          backgroundColor: Colors.white,
          indicatorColor: Colors.blue,
          indicatorHeight: 4.0,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains the current index of the selected tab.
// 3. The _tabs list contains the content for each tab.
// 4. The build method returns a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a body.
// 5. The body displays the content of the currently selected tab based on _currentIndex.
// 6. The EasyAnimatedTabBar widget is used for the bottom navigation bar.
// 7. The tab items are defined with text and icons.
// 8. When a tab is tapped, the onTap callback updates the _currentIndex, causing the UI to rebuild and display the corresponding tab content.
