# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Popup Menu Plus

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started with `popup_menu_plus`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  popup_menu_plus: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:popup_menu_plus/popup_menu_plus.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Popup Menu
You can now use the `PopupMenuPlus` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
PopupMenuPlus(
  items: [
    PopupMenuItem(
      value: 'edit',
      child: Text('Edit'),
    ),
    PopupMenuItem(
      value: 'delete',
      child: Text('Delete'),
    ),
  ],
  onSelected: (value) {
    // Handle the selected value
    if (value == 'edit') {
      // Edit action
    } else if (value == 'delete') {
      // Delete action
    }
  },
)
```

This code snippet creates a popup menu with two options: Edit and Delete. The `onSelected` callback handles the user's choice.

## Conclusion
With these steps, you can easily integrate the `popup_menu_plus` package into your Flutter application. Customize the menu items and actions as needed to fit your app's requirements.

# Complete Example of Popup Menu Plus

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:popup_menu_plus/popup_menu_plus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Popup Menu Plus Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Popup Menu Plus Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Show the popup menu when the button is pressed
              showPopupMenu(context);
            },
            child: Text('Show Popup Menu'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void showPopupMenu(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a list of menu items
    final List<PopupMenuItem<String>> menuItems = [
      PopupMenuItem(
        value: 'edit',
        child: Text('Edit'),
      ),
      PopupMenuItem(
        value: 'delete',
        child: Text('Delete'),
      ),
      PopupMenuItem(
        value: 'share',
        child: Text('Share'),
      ),
    ];

    // Show the popup menu
    showMenu(
      context: context,
      position: RelativeRect.fromLTRB(100, 100, 100, 0), // Position of the menu
      items: menuItems,
    ).then((value) {
      // Handle the selected value
      if (value != null) {
        handleMenuSelection(value);
      }
    });
  }

  void handleMenuSelection(String value) {
    // Handle the selected menu item
    switch (value) {
      case 'edit':
        print('Edit selected');
        break;
      case 'delete':
        print('Delete selected');
        break;
      case 'share':
        print('Share selected');
        break;
      default:
        print('Unknown action');
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a simple UI.
// 3. An ElevatedButton is displayed in the center of the screen.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the showPopupMenu function is called.
// 5. The showPopupMenu function creates a list of PopupMenuItem widgets and displays the menu at a specified position.
// 6. When a menu item is selected, the selected value is passed to the handleMenuSelection function.
// 7. The handleMenuSelection function processes the selected value and performs the corresponding action (e.g., printing to the console).
// 8. This flow allows for a clean and interactive user experience with the popup menu.
