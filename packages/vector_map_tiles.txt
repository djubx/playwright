# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Vector Map Tiles

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `vector_map_tiles` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `vector_map_tiles` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  vector_map_tiles: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/vector_map_tiles).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure that you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version required
    }
}
```

2. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show it on the map.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show it on the map.</string>
```

2. Ensure that your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a basic map view.

# Complete Example of Using Vector Map Tiles

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:vector_map_tiles/vector_map_tiles.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Vector Map Tiles Example',
      home: MapScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class MapScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MapScreenState createState() => _MapScreenState();
}

class _MapScreenState extends State<MapScreen> {
  late VectorMapController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the map controller
    _controller = VectorMapController();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Vector Map Tiles'),
      ),
      body: VectorMap(
        controller: _controller,
        onMapCreated: (controller) {
          // Map is created, you can perform additional setup here
          _controller.setStyle('mapbox://styles/mapbox/streets-v11');
        },
        onTap: (coordinates) {
          // Handle tap events on the map
          print('Tapped at: $coordinates');
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The MapScreen is a StatefulWidget that manages the state of the map.
// 4. In the _MapScreenState, we initialize a VectorMapController in initState.
// 5. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a VectorMap widget.
// 6. The VectorMap widget takes the controller and has callbacks for when the map is created and tapped.
// 7. When the map is created, we set the map style using the controller.
// 8. When the map is tapped, we print the coordinates of the tap to the console.
