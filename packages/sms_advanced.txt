# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the SMS Advanced Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `sms_advanced` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  sms_advanced: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open `AndroidManifest.xml` located in `android/app/src/main/` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SEND_SMS"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_SMS"/>
   ```

2. **SMS Receiver**: To receive SMS, you need to register a receiver in the same `AndroidManifest.xml`:

   ```xml
   <receiver android:name="com.sms_advanced.SmsReceiver">
       <intent-filter>
           <action android:name="android.provider.Telephony.SMS_RECEIVED"/>
       </intent-filter>
   </receiver>
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open `Info.plist` located in `ios/Runner/` and add the following:

   ```xml
   <key>NSContactsUsageDescription</key>
   <string>This app requires access to your contacts to send SMS.</string>
   <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
   <string>This app requires access to your photo library to send images via SMS.</string>
   ```

2. **SMS Capabilities**: Ensure that your app has the capability to send SMS by enabling the appropriate settings in Xcode.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have configured your project, you can start using the `sms_advanced` package in your Flutter application. Below is an example of how to send and receive SMS messages.

# Complete Example of Using SMS Advanced Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sms_advanced/sms_advanced.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'SMS Advanced Example',
      home: SmsHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class SmsHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SmsHomePageState createState() => _SmsHomePageState();
}

class _SmsHomePageState extends State<SmsHomePage> {
  final SmsSender sender = SmsSender(); // Create an instance of SmsSender
  String _messageStatus = ''; // Variable to hold the status of the sent message

  // Function to send SMS
  void _sendSms(String phoneNumber, String message) {
    sender.sendSms(SmsMessage(phoneNumber, message)).then((result) {
      setState(() {
        _messageStatus = 'Message sent: $result'; // Update the status
      });
    }).catchError((error) {
      setState(() {
        _messageStatus = 'Failed to send message: $error'; // Handle error
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('SMS Advanced Example'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Phone Number'),
              onChanged: (value) {
                // Handle phone number input
              },
            ),
            TextField(
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Message'),
              onChanged: (value) {
                // Handle message input
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Call the send SMS function with example data
                _sendSms('1234567890', 'Hello from SMS Advanced!');
              },
              child: Text('Send SMS'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(_messageStatus), // Display the message status
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The SmsHomePage widget is displayed, containing two text fields for phone number and message input.
// 3. When the user enters a phone number and message, they can press the "Send SMS" button.
// 4. The _sendSms function is called, which uses the SmsSender instance to send the SMS.
// 5. The status of the message (success or failure) is displayed on the screen.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application that allows users to send SMS messages. The application consists of a text field for the phone number, a text field for the message, and a button to send the SMS. The status of the message is displayed below the button.

### Summary of Application Flow
- The application initializes and displays a user interface with input fields for the phone number and message.
- Upon clicking the "Send SMS" button, the `_sendSms` function is triggered, which sends the SMS using the `sms_advanced` package.
- The application updates the UI to reflect whether the message was sent successfully or if there was an error.

This structured approach provides a comprehensive understanding of the `sms_advanced` package, from its features to practical implementation in a Flutter application.
