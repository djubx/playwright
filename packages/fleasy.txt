<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Fleasy Flutter Package

The **Fleasy** package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers to simplify the process of creating and managing flexible layouts. It provides a set of widgets and utilities that allow developers to build responsive UIs that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and orientations. 

## When to Use Fleasy

Fleasy is particularly useful in scenarios where:
- You need to create applications that run on multiple platforms (iOS, Android, Web).
- Your app requires a dynamic layout that adjusts based on the content or screen size.
- You want to minimize the complexity of managing layout constraints and responsiveness.

## Key Features
- **Responsive Layouts**: Automatically adjusts the layout based on screen size and orientation.
- **Customizable Widgets**: Offers a variety of widgets that can be easily customized to fit your design needs.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Built with performance in mind, ensuring smooth animations and transitions.

In summary, Fleasy is an excellent choice for developers looking to create flexible and responsive Flutter applications with minimal effort.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Fleasy

## Step 1: Adding Fleasy to Your Project

To get started with Fleasy, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  fleasy: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configurations

### Android Configuration
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # Ensure this is set to at least 10.0
```

## Step 3: Using Fleasy in Your Application

Once you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a responsive layout using Fleasy:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fleasy/fleasy.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Fleasy Example')),
        body: FleasyLayout(
          children: [
            FleasyBox(color: Colors.red, flex: 1),
            FleasyBox(color: Colors.green, flex: 2),
            FleasyBox(color: Colors.blue, flex: 3),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, `FleasyLayout` is used to create a flexible layout with three boxes of different colors and flex values. The layout will adjust based on the available screen space.

# Complete Example of Fleasy in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fleasy/fleasy.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Fleasy Example')),
        body: FleasyLayout(
          // FleasyLayout allows for flexible arrangement of child widgets
          children: [
            FleasyBox(color: Colors.red, flex: 1), // First box with flex 1
            FleasyBox(color: Colors.green, flex: 2), // Second box with flex 2
            FleasyBox(color: Colors.blue, flex: 3), // Third box with flex 3
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp, which is the root of the application.
// 3. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold is created, providing a structure for the app with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body contains a FleasyLayout widget, which is responsible for arranging its children flexibly.
// 5. Three FleasyBox widgets are added as children of FleasyLayout, each with a different color and flex value.
// 6. The layout automatically adjusts the size of each box based on the available screen space, demonstrating the responsive capabilities of the Fleasy package.
