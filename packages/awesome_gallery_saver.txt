# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Awesome Gallery Saver

## Installation
To get started with the awesome_gallery_saver package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  awesome_gallery_saver: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/awesome_gallery_saver).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key-value pair to request permission to save media:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save images and videos.</string>
```

## Usage
Once you have installed the package and configured the necessary permissions, you can start using it in your Flutter application.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to save an image:

```dart
import 'package:awesome_gallery_saver/awesome_gallery_saver.dart';

void saveImage(String imageUrl) async {
  final result = await AwesomeGallerySaver.saveImage(imageUrl);
  if (result != null) {
    print('Image saved to gallery!');
  } else {
    print('Failed to save image.');
  }
}
```

This function takes an image URL as input and attempts to save it to the gallery. The result will indicate whether the operation was successful.

# Complete Example: Using Awesome Gallery Saver

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:awesome_gallery_saver/awesome_gallery_saver.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Awesome Gallery Saver Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Gallery Saver Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // URL of the image to be saved
              String imageUrl = 'https://example.com/image.jpg';
              saveImage(imageUrl);
            },
            child: Text('Save Image to Gallery'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to save an image to the gallery
  void saveImage(String imageUrl) async {
    // Attempt to save the image using the awesome_gallery_saver package
    final result = await AwesomeGallerySaver.saveImage(imageUrl);
    // Check if the result is not null, indicating success
    if (result != null) {
      // Notify the user that the image was saved successfully
      print('Image saved to gallery!');
    } else {
      // Notify the user that the image saving failed
      print('Failed to save image.');
    }
  }
}
```

```
// Explanation of the application flow:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title "Gallery Saver Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget with an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, it triggers the saveImage function with a sample image URL.
// 6. The saveImage function calls the awesome_gallery_saver package to save the image.
// 7. If the image is saved successfully, a success message is printed; otherwise, a failure message is shown.
