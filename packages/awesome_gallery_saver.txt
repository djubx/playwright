// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user presses the "Save Image" button.
// 2. The `_saveImage` method is called.
// 3. The method replaces the `_imageBytes` with the actual image bytes.
// 4. The method calls the `AwesomeGallerySaver.saveImage` method to save the image.
// 5. If the image is saved successfully, the method prints the path where the image was saved.
// 6. If the image fails to save, the method prints an error message.
