# Tutorial

## Setup Process

To get started with the `pull_to_refresh_notification` package, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the package dependency:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     pull_to_refresh_notification: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
   ```

2. **Install the Package**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

     ```groovy
     android {
         ...
         defaultConfig {
             ...
             minSdkVersion 21
         }
     }
     ```

   - **iOS**: Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and ensure you have the necessary permissions if your app requires network access.

4. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the package:

   ```dart
   import 'package:pull_to_refresh_notification/pull_to_refresh_notification.dart';
   ```

## Using the Package

To implement the pull-to-refresh functionality, follow these steps:

1. **Wrap Your Scrollable Widget**: Use the `PullToRefreshNotification` widget to wrap your scrollable widget (e.g., `ListView`).

2. **Define the Refresh Callback**: Provide a callback function that will be called when the user pulls down to refresh.

3. **Customize the Notification**: You can customize the appearance of the notification by using various properties provided by the package.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the package:

```dart
PullToRefreshNotification(
  onRefresh: () async {
    // Your refresh logic here
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2)); // Simulate a network call
  },
  child: ListView.builder(
    itemCount: 20,
    itemBuilder: (context, index) {
      return ListTile(title: Text('Item $index'));
    },
  ),
);
```

This setup will allow users to pull down on the list to refresh the items.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pull_to_refresh_notification/pull_to_refresh_notification.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Pull to Refresh Notification Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Pull to Refresh Example'),
        ),
        body: PullToRefreshNotification(
          onRefresh: () async {
            // Simulate a network call
            await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));
            // Notify the user that the refresh is complete
            PullToRefreshNotificationController.of(context).finishRefresh();
          },
          child: ListView.builder(
            itemCount: 20,
            itemBuilder: (context, index) {
              return ListTile(title: Text('Item $index'));
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, a PullToRefreshNotification widget is used to wrap a ListView.
// 4. The onRefresh callback simulates a network call with a delay of 2 seconds.
// 5. After the delay, the finishRefresh() method is called to notify the user that the refresh is complete.
// 6. The ListView.builder creates a list of items, displaying "Item 0" to "Item 19".
// 7. Users can pull down on the list to trigger the refresh action, enhancing the app's interactivity.
```
