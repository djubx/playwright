# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Animated Gradient

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **animated_gradient** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **animated_gradient** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  animated_gradient: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 3: Using the Animated Gradient

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement an animated gradient background.

# Complete Example of Animated Gradient

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_gradient/animated_gradient.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animated Gradient Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        body: AnimatedGradient(
          // Define the gradient colors
          colors: [
            Colors.blue,
            Colors.purple,
            Colors.red,
            Colors.orange,
          ],
          // Set the duration for the animation
          duration: Duration(seconds: 5),
          // Set the gradient type
          gradientType: GradientType.linear,
          // Set the alignment of the gradient
          begin: Alignment.topLeft,
          end: Alignment.bottomRight,
          // Add a child widget to overlay on the gradient
          child: Center(
            child: Text(
              'Welcome to Animated Gradient!',
              style: TextStyle(
                fontSize: 24,
                color: Colors.white,
                fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home scaffold.
// 3. Inside the scaffold, the AnimatedGradient widget is used to create a dynamic background.
// 4. The colors property defines the gradient colors that will animate.
// 5. The duration property sets how long the animation takes to complete one cycle.
// 6. The gradientType property specifies the type of gradient (linear in this case).
// 7. The begin and end properties define the direction of the gradient.
// 8. A Center widget is used to place a Text widget in the middle of the screen, displaying a welcome message.
// 9. The text is styled to be bold and white, ensuring it stands out against the colorful background.
```
