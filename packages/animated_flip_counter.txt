# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Animated Flip Counter

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the `animated_flip_counter` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  animated_flip_counter: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package
In your Dart file where you want to use the animated flip counter, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:animated_flip_counter/animated_flip_counter.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Animated Flip Counter
You can now use the `AnimatedFlipCounter` widget in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
AnimatedFlipCounter(
  value: 123, // The value to display
  duration: Duration(milliseconds: 500), // Animation duration
  curve: Curves.easeInOut, // Animation curve
  textStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 48, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold), // Text style
)
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Optimizations
- **Performance**: Use the `AnimatedFlipCounter` in a way that minimizes rebuilds. For example, wrap it in a `StatefulWidget` and update the value only when necessary.
- **Testing**: Test the animations on both Android and iOS devices to ensure consistent performance and appearance.

With these steps, you should be able to successfully integrate and use the `animated_flip_counter` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Animated Flip Counter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_flip_counter/animated_flip_counter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animated Flip Counter Demo',
      home: CounterPage(),
    );
  }
}

class CounterPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CounterPageState createState() => _CounterPageState();
}

class _CounterPageState extends State<CounterPage> {
  int _counter = 0; // Initialize the counter value

  void _incrementCounter() {
    setState(() {
      _counter++; // Increment the counter
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Animated Flip Counter'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Animated flip counter widget
            AnimatedFlipCounter(
              value: _counter, // Display the current counter value
              duration: Duration(milliseconds: 500), // Animation duration
              curve: Curves.easeInOut, // Animation curve
              textStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 48, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold), // Text style
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between counter and button
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _incrementCounter, // Increment counter on button press
              child: Text('Increment Counter'), // Button text
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and home set to CounterPage.
// 3. CounterPage is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the counter.
// 4. The _CounterPageState class initializes the counter to 0 and provides a method to increment it.
// 5. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 6. Inside the Center widget, an AnimatedFlipCounter displays the current counter value.
// 7. An ElevatedButton is provided to increment the counter when pressed, triggering a rebuild of the widget with the new value.
// 8. The AnimatedFlipCounter animates the change in value, providing a smooth visual transition.
