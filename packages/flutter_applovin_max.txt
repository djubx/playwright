// This is the main entry point of the app.
// The app is initialized with the `MaterialApp` widget.
// The `MyHomePage` widget is displayed as the home page.

// The `MyHomePage` widget is a stateful widget.
// It initializes AppLovin MAX with the SDK key.
// It creates an ad view with the ad unit ID and ad format.
// It loads and displays the ad.

// The ad view is displayed in the `Scaffold` widget.
// The `Scaffold` widget provides a basic material design visual layout structure.

// The app displays a banner ad at the bottom of the screen.
// The ad is loaded and displayed when the app is initialized.

// This is a basic example of how to integrate AppLovin MAX into a Flutter app.
// You can customize the ad view and ad format to suit your needs.
// You can also add more features, such as ad callbacks and ad targeting.
