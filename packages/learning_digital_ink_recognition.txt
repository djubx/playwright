# Learning Digital Ink Recognition Flutter Package

The `learning_digital_ink_recognition` package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who want to incorporate handwriting recognition capabilities into their applications. This package leverages machine learning to interpret handwritten input, making it ideal for note-taking apps, educational tools, and any application that benefits from capturing user handwriting.

## When to Use This Package
- **Note-taking Applications**: Capture handwritten notes and convert them into text.
- **Educational Apps**: Allow students to write answers by hand and recognize their input.
- **Forms and Surveys**: Enable users to fill out forms using their handwriting.

## Features
- **Real-time Recognition**: Processes handwritten input in real-time, providing immediate feedback.
- **Multi-language Support**: Recognizes handwriting in various languages.
- **Customizable Models**: Allows developers to train custom models for specific handwriting styles.
- **Integration with Flutter**: Seamlessly integrates with Flutter's widget system for easy implementation.

This package is a great choice for developers looking to enhance user interaction through handwriting recognition.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Learning Digital Ink Recognition Package

## Installation
To get started with the `learning_digital_ink_recognition` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  learning_digital_ink_recognition: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       compileSdkVersion 31  // or the latest version
       ...
   }
   ```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:
   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

## Using the Package
To use the package, you will need to create a widget that captures user input and processes it. Below is a simple example of how to implement this.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:learning_digital_ink_recognition/learning_digital_ink_recognition.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String recognizedText = '';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Digital Ink Recognition')),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          Expanded(
            child: DigitalInkRecognition(
              onRecognized: (text) {
                setState(() {
                  recognizedText = text; // Update the recognized text
                });
              },
            ),
          ),
          Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
            child: Text('Recognized Text: $recognizedText'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application that uses the `learning_digital_ink_recognition` package to capture and display handwritten input.

# Complete Example of Learning Digital Ink Recognition

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:learning_digital_ink_recognition/learning_digital_ink_recognition.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Digital Ink Recognition Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String recognizedText = ''; // Variable to hold recognized text

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Digital Ink Recognition')),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          Expanded(
            child: DigitalInkRecognition(
              onRecognized: (text) {
                setState(() {
                  recognizedText = text; // Update the recognized text
                });
              },
            ),
          ),
          Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
            child: Text('Recognized Text: $recognizedText'), // Display recognized text
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets MyApp as the home widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home screen.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of recognized text.
// 4. In the build method, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Column layout.
// 5. The DigitalInkRecognition widget captures handwritten input and calls onRecognized with the recognized text.
// 6. The recognized text is displayed in a Text widget below the DigitalInkRecognition area.
