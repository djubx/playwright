# Setting Up and Using bs_flutter_modal

## Installation
To get started with `bs_flutter_modal`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  bs_flutter_modal: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/bs_flutter_modal).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `bs_flutter_modal` package, you can create a modal dialog by calling the `showModal` function. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bs_flutter_modal/bs_flutter_modal.dart';

void showMyModal(BuildContext context) {
  showModal(
    context: context,
    builder: (context) {
      return Modal(
        title: 'My Modal Title',
        content: Text('This is the content of the modal.'),
        actions: [
          TextButton(
            onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
            child: Text('Close'),
          ),
        ],
      );
    },
  );
}
```

In this example, we define a function `showMyModal` that displays a modal with a title, content, and a close button.

# Complete Example of bs_flutter_modal

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bs_flutter_modal/bs_flutter_modal.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'bs_flutter_modal Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Call the function to show the modal when the button is pressed
            showMyModal(context);
          },
          child: Text('Show Modal'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Function to show the modal dialog
void showMyModal(BuildContext context) {
  showModal(
    context: context,
    builder: (context) {
      return Modal(
        title: 'My Modal Title',
        content: Column(
          mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,
          children: [
            Text('This is the content of the modal.'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            TextField(
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter something'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
        actions: [
          TextButton(
            onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
            child: Text('Close'),
          ),
        ],
      );
    },
  );
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a HomeScreen as the home widget.
// 3. HomeScreen contains a button that, when pressed, calls the showMyModal function.
// 4. showMyModal uses the showModal function from the bs_flutter_modal package to display a modal.
// 5. The modal contains a title, some text content, a text field for user input, and a close button.
// 6. Pressing the close button dismisses the modal and returns to the HomeScreen.
