# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Bidirectional ListView Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `bidirectional_listview` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  bidirectional_listview: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configurations

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:bidirectional_listview/bidirectional_listview.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Bidirectional ListView

You can now use the `BidirectionalListView` widget in your application. Here’s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
BidirectionalListView(
  itemBuilder: (context, index) {
    return Container(
      height: 100,
      width: 100,
      color: Colors.blue,
      child: Center(child: Text('Item $index')),
    );
  },
  itemCount: 100,
);
```

This will create a grid of 100 items that can be scrolled both vertically and horizontally.

# Complete Example of Bidirectional ListView

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bidirectional_listview/bidirectional_listview.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Bidirectional ListView Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Bidirectional ListView'),
        ),
        body: BidirectionalListView(
          // The itemBuilder function creates the items for the list
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            return Container(
              height: 100, // Height of each item
              width: 100,  // Width of each item
              color: Colors.blue, // Background color of the item
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'Item $index', // Text displayed in the item
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 16),
                ),
              ),
            );
          },
          itemCount: 100, // Total number of items
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Bidirectional ListView'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is a BidirectionalListView widget.
// 5. The BidirectionalListView uses an itemBuilder to create 100 items, each with a height and width of 100 pixels.
// 6. Each item is a blue container with centered text displaying its index.
// 7. The user can scroll both vertically and horizontally to view all items.
```
