# Setting Up and Using flutter_email_validator

## Installation
To add the `flutter_email_validator` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_email_validator: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
The `flutter_email_validator` package works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms. There are no additional configurations required for either platform, making it a hassle-free choice for email validation.

## Basic Usage
To use the package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_email_validator/flutter_email_validator.dart';
```

You can then use the `EmailValidator.validate()` method to check if an email is valid. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it in a form:

```dart
// Inside your widget
final email = 'test@example.com';
bool isValid = EmailValidator.validate(email);
```

This will return `true` if the email is valid and `false` otherwise.

# Complete Example of flutter_email_validator

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_email_validator/flutter_email_validator.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Email Validator Example',
      home: EmailValidationScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class EmailValidationScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _EmailValidationScreenState createState() => _EmailValidationScreenState();
}

class _EmailValidationScreenState extends State<EmailValidationScreen> {
  final TextEditingController _emailController = TextEditingController();
  String _validationMessage = '';

  void _validateEmail() {
    // Get the email input from the controller
    String email = _emailController.text;

    // Validate the email using the EmailValidator
    if (EmailValidator.validate(email)) {
      setState(() {
        _validationMessage = 'Email is valid!';
      });
    } else {
      setState(() {
        _validationMessage = 'Please enter a valid email.';
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Email Validator'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              controller: _emailController,
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Enter your email',
                errorText: _validationMessage.isEmpty ? null : _validationMessage,
              ),
              onChanged: (value) {
                // Clear the validation message when the user types
                setState(() {
                  _validationMessage = '';
                });
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _validateEmail,
              child: Text('Validate Email'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (EmailValidationScreen).
// 3. EmailValidationScreen is a stateful widget that manages the email input and validation message.
// 4. The user enters an email in the TextField, which is controlled by _emailController.
// 5. When the user presses the "Validate Email" button, the _validateEmail method is called.
// 6. This method checks if the entered email is valid using EmailValidator.validate().
// 7. Based on the validation result, it updates the _validationMessage state, which is displayed below the TextField.
// 8. If the email is valid, a success message is shown; otherwise, an error message prompts the user to enter a valid email.
