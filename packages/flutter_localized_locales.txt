# Tutorial: Setting Up flutter_localized_locales

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_localized_locales` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

First, add the `flutter_localized_locales` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_localized_locales: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Configure Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary configurations for localization. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following inside the `<application>` tag:

```xml
<application
    ...
    android:configChanges="locale|layoutDirection|fontScale|screenSize|smallestScreenSize|screenLayout|density|uiMode">
```

This configuration allows your app to handle locale changes without restarting.

## Step 3: Configure iOS

For iOS, you need to ensure that your app supports localization. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>CFBundleLocalizations</key>
<array>
    <string>en</string>
    <string>es</string>
    <string>fr</string>
    <!-- Add other languages as needed -->
</array>
```

## Step 4: Initialize the Package

In your main Dart file, initialize the `flutter_localized_locales` package. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_localized_locales/flutter_localized_locales.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Localized App',
      localizationsDelegates: [
        GlobalMaterialLocalizations.delegate,
        GlobalWidgetsLocalizations.delegate,
        GlobalCupertinoLocalizations.delegate,
        LocalizedLocale.delegate, // Add this line
      ],
      supportedLocales: [
        Locale('en', ''), // English
        Locale('es', ''), // Spanish
        Locale('fr', ''), // French
        // Add other supported locales
      ],
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Use Localized Locales

Now, you can use the localized locales in your application. For example, you can display the current locale and format dates or numbers based on the selected locale.

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Get the current locale
    Locale myLocale = LocalizedLocale.of(context).locale;

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Localized Locales Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Current Locale: ${myLocale.languageCode}'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

With these steps, you have successfully set up the `flutter_localized_locales` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of flutter_localized_locales

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_localized_locales/flutter_localized_locales.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Localized App',
      localizationsDelegates: [
        GlobalMaterialLocalizations.delegate,
        GlobalWidgetsLocalizations.delegate,
        GlobalCupertinoLocalizations.delegate,
        LocalizedLocale.delegate, // Delegate for localized locales
      ],
      supportedLocales: [
        Locale('en', ''), // English
        Locale('es', ''), // Spanish
        Locale('fr', ''), // French
        // Add other supported locales
      ],
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Get the current locale
    Locale myLocale = LocalizedLocale.of(context).locale;

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Localized Locales Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Current Locale: ${myLocale.languageCode}'), // Display current locale
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text('Formatted Date: ${DateFormat.yMMMM(myLocale.toString()).format(DateTime.now())}'), // Format date based on locale
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with localization delegates and supported locales.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget is displayed as the home screen.
// 4. Inside RealFlutter, the current locale is retrieved using LocalizedLocale.of(context).
// 5. The current locale is displayed on the screen.
// 6. The current date is formatted according to the user's locale and displayed below the locale information.
