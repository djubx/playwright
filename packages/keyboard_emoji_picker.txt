# Tutorial: Setting Up the Keyboard Emoji Picker

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `keyboard_emoji_picker` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `keyboard_emoji_picker` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  keyboard_emoji_picker: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/keyboard_emoji_picker).

## Step 2: Install the Package

Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable the `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` in your `Info.plist` file if you plan to allow users to select emojis from their photo library. Add the following line:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to select emojis.</string>
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that the package is installed and configured, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is an example of how to implement the emoji picker in your app.

# Complete Example of Using Keyboard Emoji Picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:keyboard_emoji_picker/keyboard_emoji_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Emoji Picker Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: EmojiPickerDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class EmojiPickerDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _EmojiPickerDemoState createState() => _EmojiPickerDemoState();
}

class _EmojiPickerDemoState extends State<EmojiPickerDemo> {
  // TextEditingController to manage the text input
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController();
  // Boolean to control the visibility of the emoji picker
  bool _isEmojiPickerVisible = false;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Emoji Picker Demo'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Text field for user input
          TextField(
            controller: _controller,
            decoration: InputDecoration(
              hintText: 'Type a message...',
              suffixIcon: IconButton(
                icon: Icon(Icons.emoji_emotions),
                onPressed: () {
                  // Toggle the visibility of the emoji picker
                  setState(() {
                    _isEmojiPickerVisible = !_isEmojiPickerVisible;
                  });
                },
              ),
            ),
          ),
          // Show the emoji picker if it's visible
          if (_isEmojiPickerVisible)
            KeyboardEmojiPicker(
              onEmojiSelected: (emoji) {
                // Append the selected emoji to the text field
                _controller.text += emoji.emoji;
                // Close the emoji picker
                setState(() {
                  _isEmojiPickerVisible = false;
                });
              },
            ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home of the app is set to EmojiPickerDemo, which is a stateful widget.
// 4. Inside EmojiPickerDemo, a TextEditingController is created to manage the text input.
// 5. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Column containing a TextField and the emoji picker.
// 6. The TextField has a suffix icon button that toggles the visibility of the emoji picker when pressed.
// 7. If the emoji picker is visible, it is displayed below the TextField.
// 8. When an emoji is selected, it is appended to the text field, and the emoji picker is closed.
```
