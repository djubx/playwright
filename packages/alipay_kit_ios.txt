## Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `alipay_kit_ios`

### Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `alipay_kit_ios` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  alipay_kit_ios: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

### Step 2: iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: You need to add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file to allow your app to communicate with Alipay:

```xml
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
    <string>alipay</string>
</array>
```

2. **CocoaPods Installation**: Ensure that you have CocoaPods installed and run the following command in your iOS directory:

```bash
pod install
```

### Step 3: Android Configuration (if applicable)

Although this package is primarily for iOS, if you plan to support Android, ensure you have the necessary configurations in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file.

### Step 4: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initiate a payment.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:alipay_kit_ios/alipay_kit_ios.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Alipay Integration')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initiate Alipay payment
              String orderString = "your_order_string_here"; // Replace with your order string
              String result = await AlipayKit.pay(orderString);
              // Handle the payment result
              print("Payment Result: $result");
            },
            child: Text('Pay with Alipay'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Testing

        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Step 1: Define the order string for the payment
              String orderString = "your_order_string_here"; // Replace with your actual order string

              // Step 2: Call the Alipay payment method
              String result = await AlipayKit.pay(orderString);

              // Step 3: Handle the payment result
              // Here, you can check the result and update the UI accordingly
              print("Payment Result: $result");
            },
            child: Text('Pay with Alipay'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:

// 2. When the button is pressed, it triggers the payment process.
// 3. The order string is defined, which contains the necessary information for the payment.
// 4. The AlipayKit's pay method is called with the order string.
