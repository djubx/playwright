# Global Snack Bar Flutter Package

The **global_snack_bar** Flutter package is a powerful tool for displaying snack bars across your Flutter application. Snack bars are brief messages that provide feedback about an operation in a way that doesn’t interrupt the user’s experience. This package allows developers to show snack bars globally, making it easier to manage notifications and alerts from anywhere in the app.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the **global_snack_bar** package in scenarios such as:
- Displaying success messages after a user action (e.g., form submission).
- Notifying users of errors or warnings (e.g., failed network requests).
- Providing contextual information without disrupting the user flow.

## Features

- **Global Access**: Show snack bars from anywhere in your app without needing to pass context around.
- **Customizable**: Easily customize the appearance and behavior of snack bars.
- **Multiple Snack Bars**: Manage multiple snack bars simultaneously, ensuring that they do not overlap or interfere with each other.
- **Dismissible**: Users can dismiss snack bars manually, or they can disappear automatically after a set duration.

With these features, the **global_snack_bar** package enhances user experience by providing timely feedback in a non-intrusive manner.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Global Snack Bar

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **global_snack_bar** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  global_snack_bar: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:global_snack_bar/global_snack_bar.dart';
```

## Step 3: Setting Up the Global Snack Bar

You need to initialize the global snack bar in your main application widget. Here’s how to do it:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Global Snack Bar Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Using the Global Snack Bar

You can now use the global snack bar anywhere in your app. Here’s an example of how to show a snack bar when a button is pressed:

```dart
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            GlobalSnackBar.show(
              context: context,
              message: 'This is a global snack bar!',
              duration: Duration(seconds: 2),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Show Snack Bar'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions and configurations. Typically, no additional setup is required for snack bars.

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your app's deployment target is set correctly in the `ios/Podfile`. Again, no specific configurations are needed for using snack bars.

## Optimizations

- **Performance**: Use snack bars judiciously to avoid overwhelming users with too many notifications.
- **Customization**: Customize the appearance of the snack bar to match your app's theme for a cohesive user experience.

With these steps, you can effectively integrate and utilize the **global_snack_bar** package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Global Snack Bar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:global_snack_bar/global_snack_bar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Global Snack Bar Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Show a global snack bar when the button is pressed
            GlobalSnackBar.show(
              context: context,
              message: 'This is a global snack bar!',
              duration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Duration for which the snack bar is visible
            );
          },
          child: Text('Show Snack Bar'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. HomeScreen contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the GlobalSnackBar.show method is called.
// 6. The snack bar displays a message for 2 seconds, providing feedback to the user.
// 7. The user can see the snack bar at the bottom of the screen without interrupting their flow.
```
