# Fitted GridView: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To use the **fitted_gridview** package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  fitted_gridview: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
The **fitted_gridview** package works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms. However, ensure that your Flutter environment is set up correctly for both platforms. You may need to configure your Android and iOS projects to support the latest Flutter features.

### Android Configuration
- Ensure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration
- For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using Fitted GridView
To use the **fitted_gridview** package, you can create a simple grid layout by following these steps:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:
   ```dart
   import 'package:fitted_gridview/fitted_gridview.dart';
   ```

2. Create a widget that utilizes the `FittedGridView` class to display your items.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fitted_gridview/fitted_gridview.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Fitted GridView Example')),
        body: FittedGridView(
          itemCount: 20,
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            return Card(
              color: Colors.blueAccent,
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'Item $index',
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
                ),
              ),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application that displays a grid of cards, each labeled with its index. The `FittedGridView` automatically adjusts the layout based on the screen size.

# Complete Example of Fitted GridView

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fitted_gridview/fitted_gridview.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Fitted GridView Example')),
        body: FittedGridView(
          itemCount: 20, // Total number of items to display
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            return Card(
              color: Colors.blueAccent, // Card color
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'Item $index', // Display item index
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
                ),
              ),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the app
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application, which calls runApp() to start the app.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the main structure of the app.
// 3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold widget.
// 4. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Fitted GridView Example'.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold is a FittedGridView, which takes an itemCount of 20.
// 6. The itemBuilder function creates a Card for each item, displaying its index.
// 7. Each Card is styled with a blue background and centered text.
// 8. The FittedGridView automatically adjusts the layout based on the screen size, providing a responsive grid.
