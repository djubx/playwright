     showDialog(
       context: context,
       builder: (context) {
         return CustomLicensePage(
           title: 'Licenses',

# Complete Example of flutter_custom_license_page

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_custom_license_page/flutter_custom_license_page.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Custom License Page Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // When the button is pressed, show the custom license page
            showLicensePage(context);
          },
          child: Text('Show Licenses'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void showLicensePage(BuildContext context) {
    // Display the custom license page in a dialog
    showDialog(
      context: context,
      builder: (context) {
        return CustomLicensePage(
          title: 'Licenses',
          // You can customize the text style and other properties here
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
3. The HomeScreen widget contains an AppBar and a centered ElevatedButton.
4. When the button is pressed, the showLicensePage function is called.
5. This function uses showDialog to display the CustomLicensePage.
6. The CustomLicensePage shows the licenses of the third-party packages used in the app.
7. The user can read the licenses and dismiss the dialog to return to the home screen.
