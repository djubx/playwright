# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Shape of View Null Safe Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `shape_of_view_null_safe` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  shape_of_view_null_safe: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/shape_of_view_null_safe).

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your `ios/Podfile` has the platform version set to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the package to start using it:

```dart
import 'package:shape_of_view_null_safe/shape_of_view_null_safe.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package

You can now use the `ShapeOfView` widget to create custom shapes. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a circular shape:

```dart
ShapeOfView(
  shape: BoxShape.circle,
  elevation: 4.0,
  child: Container(
    color: Colors.blue,
    height: 100,
    width: 100,
  ),
);
```

This code snippet creates a circular view with a blue background.

With these steps, you are now ready to use the `shape_of_view_null_safe` package in your Flutter applications!

            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Custom clipper for creating a triangle shape
class TriangleClipper extends CustomClipper<Path> {
  @override
  Path getClip(Size size) {
    var path = Path();
    path.lineTo(size.width, size.height);
    path.lineTo(0, size.height);

/*
The application starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
Inside the Scaffold, we have an AppBar and a Center widget that contains a Column.
The Column holds two ShapeOfView widgets:
1. The first ShapeOfView creates a circular shape with a blue background and displays the text "Circle".
2. The second ShapeOfView uses a ClipPath with a custom TriangleClipper to create a triangular shape with a red background and displays the text "Triangle".
The TriangleClipper class defines how to clip the container into a triangle shape.
