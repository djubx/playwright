# Flex Gap: A Flutter Package for Flexible Spacing

The **flex_gap** package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to create responsive layouts with flexible spacing between widgets. It allows developers to easily manage gaps in their UI, making it particularly useful for creating visually appealing designs that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.

## When to Use Flex Gap
- **Responsive Design**: When building applications that need to look good on various screen sizes.
- **Dynamic Layouts**: When the number of widgets can change based on user input or data.
- **Consistent Spacing**: When you want to maintain consistent spacing between widgets without hardcoding values.

## Features
- **Flexible Gaps**: Easily define gaps that adjust based on the available space.
- **Customizable**: Allows for customization of gap sizes and behaviors.
- **Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with other Flutter widgets, making it easy to integrate into existing projects.

Overall, the **flex_gap** package simplifies the process of managing spacing in Flutter applications, enhancing both the developer experience and the end-user interface.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Flex Gap

## Installation
To get started with the **flex_gap** package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flex_gap: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
The **flex_gap** package is designed to work on both Android and iOS without any additional platform-specific configurations. However, ensure that your Flutter environment is set up correctly for both platforms.

## Basic Usage
To use the **flex_gap** package, you can wrap your widgets with the `FlexGap` widget. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flex_gap/flex_gap.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flex Gap Example')),
      body: FlexGap(
        gap: 20.0, // Set the gap size
        children: [
          Container(color: Colors.red, height: 100, width: 100),
          Container(color: Colors.green, height: 100, width: 100),
          Container(color: Colors.blue, height: 100, width: 100),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `FlexGap` widget creates a gap of 20 pixels between the three colored containers.

# Complete Example of Flex Gap in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flex_gap/flex_gap.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flex Gap Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flex Gap Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: FlexGap(
          gap: 20.0, // Define the gap size between children
          children: [
            Container(color: Colors.red, height: 100, width: 100), // First child
            Container(color: Colors.green, height: 100, width: 100), // Second child
            Container(color: Colors.blue, height: 100, width: 100), // Third child
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a FlexGap widget is created with a gap of 20 pixels.
// 5. The FlexGap widget contains three colored containers, each 100x100 pixels.
// 6. The FlexGap automatically manages the spacing between the containers, ensuring a consistent layout.
