# Tutorial: Setting Up Swipeable Page Route

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `swipeable_page_route` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `swipeable_page_route` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  swipeable_page_route: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install Packages

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:swipeable_page_route/swipeable_page_route.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using Swipeable Page Route

You can now use the `SwipeablePageRoute` in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
// Inside your widget
Navigator.of(context).push(SwipeablePageRoute(
  builder: (context) => NextPage(),
));
```

This will allow users to swipe between pages seamlessly.

# Complete Example of Swipeable Page Route

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:swipeable_page_route/swipeable_page_route.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Swipeable Page Route Example',
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Page'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate to the next page with swipeable transition
            Navigator.of(context).push(SwipeablePageRoute(
              builder: (context) => SecondPage(),
            ));
          },
          child: Text('Go to Second Page'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SecondPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Second Page'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate back to the home page with swipeable transition
            Navigator.of(context).push(SwipeablePageRoute(
              builder: (context) => HomePage(),
            ));
          },
          child: Text('Go Back to Home Page'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the `RealFlutter` class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The `HomePage` is displayed first, containing a button to navigate to the `SecondPage`.
// 3. When the button is pressed, the `SwipeablePageRoute` is used to navigate to the `SecondPage`.
// 4. The `SecondPage` has a button that allows users to navigate back to the `HomePage` using the same swipeable transition.
// 5. Users can swipe left or right to navigate between the two pages, enhancing the overall user experience.
```
