# Flutter File Dialog Package

The `flutter_file_dialog` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that simplifies the process of opening file dialogs for selecting files and directories. This package is particularly useful when building applications that require user interaction for file selection, such as document uploaders, image pickers, or any app that needs to access files on the device.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `flutter_file_dialog` package in scenarios such as:
- **File Uploads**: When your app needs to allow users to upload files from their device.
- **Image Selection**: For apps that require users to select images from their gallery or file system.
- **Document Management**: When building applications that manage documents, allowing users to select files from various locations.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Customizable Dialogs**: Provides options to customize the file dialog appearance and behavior.
- **Directory Selection**: Allows users to select entire directories, not just individual files.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that integrates easily into existing Flutter applications.

With these features, the `flutter_file_dialog` package enhances user experience by providing a native file selection interface that is both intuitive and efficient.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_file_dialog

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_file_dialog` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_file_dialog` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_file_dialog: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file to request permission for accessing files:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to select images.</string>
<key>NSDocumentsUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your documents to select files.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement file selection using the `flutter_file_dialog` package.

# Complete Example: Using flutter_file_dialog

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_file_dialog/flutter_file_dialog.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter File Dialog Example',
      home: FileDialogExample(),
    );
  }
}

class FileDialogExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _FileDialogExampleState createState() => _FileDialogExampleState();
}

class _FileDialogExampleState extends State<FileDialogExample> {
  String? _filePath; // Variable to store the selected file path

  // Function to open the file dialog
  Future<void> _openFileDialog() async {
    // Define the options for the file dialog
    final params = OpenFileDialogParams(
      dialogTitle: 'Select a file',
      fileType: FileType.custom, // Custom file type
      allowedFileTypes: ['jpg', 'png', 'pdf'], // Allowed file types
    );

    // Open the file dialog and wait for the result
    final filePath = await FlutterFileDialog.pickFile(params: params);
    
    // Update the state with the selected file path
    setState(() {
      _filePath = filePath; // Store the selected file path
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('File Dialog Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the selected file path
            Text(
              _filePath != null ? 'Selected File: $_filePath' : 'No file selected',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to open the file dialog
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _openFileDialog,
              child: Text('Open File Dialog'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application that uses the flutter_file_dialog package to open a file dialog and select files. 
// Here's a step-by-step explanation of the application flow:

// 1. **Main Function**: The `main` function initializes the app by calling `runApp` with the `RealFlutter` widget.
// 2. **RealFlutter Class**: This is the main widget of the application, which sets up the MaterialApp and its home page.
// 3. **FileDialogExample Class**: This stateful widget manages the file selection process. It contains a state variable `_filePath` to store the path of the selected file.
// 4. **_openFileDialog Method**: This method is called when the user presses the button to open the file dialog. It defines the parameters for the dialog, including the title and allowed file types, and then opens the dialog.
// 5. **Updating State**: Once a file is selected, the state is updated with the selected file path, which triggers a rebuild of the UI to display the selected file.
// 6. **UI Layout**: The UI consists of a text widget to display the selected file path and a button to trigger the file dialog.
