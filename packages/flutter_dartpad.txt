# flutter_dartpad Package Overview

The `flutter_dartpad` package is a powerful tool that allows Flutter developers to integrate DartPad functionality directly into their applications. DartPad is an online editor for Dart that enables developers to write, run, and share Dart code snippets. This package is particularly useful for educational purposes, allowing users to experiment with Dart code in a live environment without needing to set up a local development environment.

## When to Use This Package
- **Educational Apps**: Ideal for apps aimed at teaching Dart and Flutter concepts.
- **Code Sharing**: Useful for sharing code snippets with users or within a community.
- **Interactive Tutorials**: Great for creating interactive tutorials where users can modify and run code.

## Features
- **Embedded DartPad**: Integrate a fully functional DartPad within your Flutter app.
- **Customizable UI**: Modify the appearance and behavior of the DartPad to fit your app's design.
- **Code Execution**: Users can write and execute Dart code in real-time.
- **Error Handling**: Provides feedback on code errors and issues directly within the app.

Overall, the `flutter_dartpad` package enhances the interactivity of Flutter applications, making it easier for users to learn and experiment with Dart code.

# Setup and Usage of flutter_dartpad

## Installation
To get started with the `flutter_dartpad` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_dartpad: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_dartpad).

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
1. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Add internet permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
1. Ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` file to allow network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `flutter_dartpad` package, you can create a simple widget that displays the DartPad. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_dartpad/flutter_dartpad.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('DartPad Example'),
      ),
      body: DartPad(
        // You can customize the DartPad here
        initialCode: 'void main() => print("Hello, DartPad!");',
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application with an embedded DartPad that runs a simple Dart program.

# Complete Example of flutter_dartpad

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_dartpad/flutter_dartpad.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'DartPad Integration',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('DartPad Example'),
      ),
      body: DartPad(
        // Initial code that will be displayed in the DartPad
        initialCode: '''
          void main() {
            print("Hello, DartPad!");
          }
        ''',
        // Optional: Customize the DartPad's appearance
        backgroundColor: Colors.white,
        // Optional: Set the DartPad's height
        height: 400,
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to RealFlutter, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 4. RealFlutter builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body containing the DartPad widget.
// 5. The DartPad widget is initialized with some default Dart code that prints "Hello, DartPad!" to the console.
// 6. Users can modify the code in the DartPad and run it to see the output in real-time.
```
