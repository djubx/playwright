# Setting Up and Using the `flutter_polls` Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_polls` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_polls` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_polls: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the `flutter_polls` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_polls/flutter_polls.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package

You can now create a poll using the `RealFlutter` class. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a poll in your application:

```dart
// Create a poll with options
final poll = Poll(
  question: "What's your favorite programming language?",
  options: [
    PollOption(text: "Dart"),
    PollOption(text: "JavaScript"),
    PollOption(text: "Python"),
    PollOption(text: "Java"),
  ],
);
```

This setup allows you to create a basic poll. You can further customize it by adding features like real-time results and user feedback.

# Complete Example of Using `flutter_polls`

Below is a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the `flutter_polls` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_polls/flutter_polls.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Polls Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: PollPage(),
    );
  }
}

class PollPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a poll with options
    final poll = Poll(
      question: "What's your favorite programming language?",
      options: [
        PollOption(text: "Dart"),
        PollOption(text: "JavaScript"),
        PollOption(text: "Python"),
        PollOption(text: "Java"),
      ],
    );

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Poll Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: PollWidget(
          poll: poll,
          onVote: (selectedOption) {
            // Handle the vote
            print("User voted for: ${selectedOption.text}");
            // Here you can also update the state to show results
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets up the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to PollPage, which contains the poll logic.
// 4. In PollPage, a Poll object is created with a question and options.
// 5. The PollWidget is displayed in the center of the screen, allowing users to vote.
// 6. When a user votes, the onVote callback is triggered, printing the selected option to the console.
// 7. You can expand this by updating the UI to show results or handle votes in a more complex way.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application that displays a poll asking users about their favorite programming language. The application flow is straightforward, allowing users to interact with the poll and submit their votes. You can further enhance this application by adding features like displaying results, saving votes to a database, or integrating with a backend service for real-time updates.
