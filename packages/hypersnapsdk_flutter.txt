# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Hypersnap SDK Flutter

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `hypersnapsdk_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  hypersnapsdk_flutter: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Add the necessary permissions for camera and storage access.

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.yourapp">

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>

    <application
        android:label="yourapp"
        android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher">
        ...
    </application>
</manifest>
```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`.

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Add the following keys to request camera and photo library access.

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to take photos.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save photos.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that the package is set up, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to capture an image and apply a filter.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:hypersnapsdk_flutter/hypersnapsdk_flutter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String? _imagePath;

  // Function to capture an image
  Future<void> _captureImage() async {
    try {
      // Capture the image using the Hypersnap SDK
      String imagePath = await HypersnapSdk.captureImage();
      setState(() {
        _imagePath = imagePath; // Update the state with the captured image path
      });
    } catch (e) {
      print("Error capturing image: $e");
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Hypersnap SDK Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            if (_imagePath != null) 
              Image.file(File(_imagePath!)), // Display the captured image
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _captureImage,
              child: Text('Capture Image'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that captures an image when the button is pressed and displays it on the screen.

# Complete Example of Hypersnap SDK Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:hypersnapsdk_flutter/hypersnapsdk_flutter.dart';
import 'dart:io';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String? _imagePath; // Variable to hold the path of the captured image

  // Function to capture an image
  Future<void> _captureImage() async {
    try {
      // Capture the image using the Hypersnap SDK
      String imagePath = await HypersnapSdk.captureImage();
      setState(() {
        _imagePath = imagePath; // Update the state with the captured image path
      });
    } catch (e) {
      print("Error capturing image: $e"); // Handle any errors during image capture
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Hypersnap SDK Example')), // App bar title
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            if (_imagePath != null) 
              Image.file(File(_imagePath!)), // Display the captured image if available
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _captureImage, // Capture image on button press
              child: Text('Capture Image'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 2. The _RealFlutterState class manages the state of the widget.
// 3. When the app is built, it displays a button to capture an image.
// 4. Upon pressing the button, the _captureImage function is called.
// 5. This function uses the Hypersnap SDK to capture an image and updates the state with the image path.
// 6. If an image is captured, it is displayed on the screen.
// 7. The app handles errors gracefully by printing them to the console.
```
