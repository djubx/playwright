# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Live Activities Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **live_activities** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  live_activities: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/live_activities).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### iOS Configuration

1. **Enable Background Modes**: Open your `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode. Go to the project settings, select the "Capabilities" tab, and enable "Background Modes". Check the "Background fetch" and "Remote notifications" options.

2. **Update Info.plist**: Add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file to request permission for notifications:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>fetch</string>
    <string>remote-notification</string>
</array>
<key>NSUserTrackingUsageDescription</key>
<string>We use your data to provide live updates.</string>
```

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE"/>
```

2. **Service Declaration**: Declare a service in the same `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<service
    android:name=".YourService"
    android:permission="android.permission.BIND_JOB_SERVICE"
    android:exported="true"/>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that the package is set up, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a live activity.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:live_activities/live_activities.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Live Activities Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Start a live activity
              LiveActivities.startActivity(
                activityId: 'activity_1',
                title: 'Live Activity',
                subtitle: 'Tracking your progress',
                content: 'In progress...',
              );
            },
            child: Text('Start Live Activity'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, a live activity is started with a title, subtitle, and content.

# Complete Example of Live Activities in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:live_activities/live_activities.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Live Activities Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Start a live activity with a unique ID
              LiveActivities.startActivity(
                activityId: 'activity_1', // Unique identifier for the activity
                title: 'Live Activity', // Title displayed on the notification
                subtitle: 'Tracking your progress', // Subtitle for additional context
                content: 'In progress...', // Main content of the notification
              );
            },
            child: Text('Start Live Activity'), // Button to trigger the live activity
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Entry point of the application
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and displays a button labeled "Start Live Activity".
// 2. When the button is pressed, the `onPressed` callback is triggered.
// 3. The `LiveActivities.startActivity` method is called with parameters:
//    - `activityId`: A unique identifier for the live activity.
//    - `title`: The title of the live activity notification.
//    - `subtitle`: A brief description or context for the activity.
//    - `content`: The main content that will be displayed in the notification.
// 4. The live activity is now visible on the device's lock screen or home screen, providing real-time updates to the user.
