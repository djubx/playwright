# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Emerge Alert Dialog

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `emerge_alert_dialog` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  emerge_alert_dialog: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

To use the `emerge_alert_dialog` package, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:emerge_alert_dialog/emerge_alert_dialog.dart';
```

You can then create and display an alert dialog using the following code snippet:

```dart
EmergeAlertDialog(
  title: 'Confirmation',
  content: 'Are you sure you want to proceed?',
  actions: [
    EmergeDialogAction(
      label: 'Cancel',
      onPressed: () {
        // Handle cancel action
      },
    ),
    EmergeDialogAction(
      label: 'Proceed',
      onPressed: () {
        // Handle proceed action
      },
    ),
  ],
).show(context);
```

This code creates a simple confirmation dialog with "Cancel" and "Proceed" buttons.

# Complete Example of Emerge Alert Dialog

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:emerge_alert_dialog/emerge_alert_dialog.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Emerge Alert Dialog Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Emerge Alert Dialog Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Show the alert dialog when the button is pressed
              EmergeAlertDialog(
                title: 'Confirmation',
                content: 'Are you sure you want to proceed?',
                actions: [
                  EmergeDialogAction(
                    label: 'Cancel',
                    onPressed: () {
                      // Close the dialog when Cancel is pressed
                      Navigator.of(context).pop();
                    },
                  ),
                  EmergeDialogAction(
                    label: 'Proceed',
                    onPressed: () {
                      // Handle the proceed action
                      Navigator.of(context).pop();
                      // Show a snackbar as feedback
                      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                        SnackBar(content: Text('Proceeding...')),
                      );
                    },
                  ),
                ],
              ).show(context);
            },
            child: Text('Show Alert Dialog'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, there's an AppBar and a Center widget containing an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, an EmergeAlertDialog is created and displayed.
// 5. The dialog has a title, content, and two actions: Cancel and Proceed.
// 6. If Cancel is pressed, the dialog closes without any further action.
// 7. If Proceed is pressed, the dialog closes, and a Snackbar is shown to provide feedback to the user.
```
