  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_audio_output: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_audio_output).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request permission for audio usage:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio output.</string>
<key>NSAppleMusicUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your music library for audio playback.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `flutter_audio_output` package, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_audio_output/flutter_audio_output.dart';
```

2. Initialize the audio output manager and start using its features:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: AudioOutputExample(),
    );
  }
}

class AudioOutputExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _AudioOutputExampleState createState() => _AudioOutputExampleState();
}

class _AudioOutputExampleState extends State<AudioOutputExample> {
  // Initialize the audio output manager
  final FlutterAudioOutput audioOutput = FlutterAudioOutput();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Request audio output device
    audioOutput.requestAudioOutput();
  }

  // Additional methods to control audio output can be added here
}
```

This setup will allow you to manage audio output in your Flutter application effectively.

# Complete Example of flutter_audio_output

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_audio_output/flutter_audio_output.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Create an instance of the audio output manager
  final FlutterAudioOutput audioOutput = FlutterAudioOutput();
  String currentOutputDevice = "Unknown";

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Request audio output device on initialization
    audioOutput.requestAudioOutput();
    // Listen for changes in audio output device
    audioOutput.onOutputDeviceChanged.listen((device) {
      setState(() {
        currentOutputDevice = device.name; // Update the current output device
      });
    });
  }

  // Method to play audio
  void playAudio() async {
    await audioOutput.play('https://www.example.com/audio.mp3'); // Play audio from a URL
  }

  // Method to stop audio
  void stopAudio() async {
    await audioOutput.stop(); // Stop the currently playing audio
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Audio Output Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Current Output Device: $currentOutputDevice'), // Display current output device
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: playAudio, // Play audio on button press
              child: Text('Play Audio'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: stopAudio, // Stop audio on button press
              child: Text('Stop Audio'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    audioOutput.dispose(); // Dispose of the audio output manager
    super.dispose();
  }
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation
// The application starts by running the RealFlutter widget.
// In the RealFlutter widget, we create an instance of FlutterAudioOutput to manage audio.
// During initialization (initState), we request the audio output device and set up a listener 
// to update the UI whenever the output device changes.
// The UI consists of a text display showing the current output device and two buttons: 
// one to play audio and another to stop it.
// When the "Play Audio" button is pressed, the playAudio method is called, which plays audio 
// from a specified URL.
// When the "Stop Audio" button is pressed, the stopAudio method is called to stop any 
// currently playing audio.
// Finally, we ensure to dispose of the audio output manager when the widget is removed from 
// the widget tree to free up resources.
