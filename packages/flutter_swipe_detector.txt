# Flutter Swipe Detector Package

The `flutter_swipe_detector` package is a powerful tool for detecting swipe gestures in Flutter applications. It provides an easy way to implement swipe functionality, allowing developers to create more interactive and user-friendly applications. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where swipe gestures are a natural part of the user experience, such as in image galleries, navigation menus, or any application that benefits from gesture-based interactions.

## When to Use

You should consider using the `flutter_swipe_detector` package when:
- You want to enhance user interaction through swipe gestures.
- You are building applications that require navigation through swipes, such as photo viewers or onboarding screens.
- You need to detect swipe directions (left, right, up, down) to trigger specific actions.

## Features

- **Direction Detection**: Easily detect swipe directions (left, right, up, down).
- **Customizable Sensitivity**: Adjust the sensitivity of swipe detection to suit your application's needs.
- **Simple Integration**: Easy to integrate into existing Flutter applications with minimal setup.

Overall, the `flutter_swipe_detector` package simplifies the process of adding swipe functionality to your Flutter apps, making it a valuable addition to your toolkit.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_swipe_detector

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `flutter_swipe_detector` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_swipe_detector: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Basic Setup

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement swipe detection.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_swipe_detector/flutter_swipe_detector.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: SwipeDetectorExample(),
    );
  }
}

class SwipeDetectorExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Swipe Detector Example')),
      body: SwipeDetector(
        onSwipeLeft: () {
          // Action for swipe left
          print('Swiped Left!');
        },
        onSwipeRight: () {
          // Action for swipe right
          print('Swiped Right!');
        },
        onSwipeUp: () {
          // Action for swipe up
          print('Swiped Up!');
        },
        onSwipeDown: () {
          // Action for swipe down
          print('Swiped Down!');
        },
        child: Center(
          child: Text('Swipe in any direction!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that detects swipe gestures in all four directions. The `SwipeDetector` widget wraps around a `Center` widget that displays a message. When a swipe is detected, the corresponding action is triggered, and a message is printed to the console.

# Complete Example of flutter_swipe_detector

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_swipe_detector/flutter_swipe_detector.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: SwipeDetectorExample(),
    );
  }
}

class SwipeDetectorExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Swipe Detector Example')),
      body: SwipeDetector(
        onSwipeLeft: () {
          // Action for swipe left
          print('Swiped Left!'); // Log swipe left action
        },
        onSwipeRight: () {
          // Action for swipe right
          print('Swiped Right!'); // Log swipe right action
        },
        onSwipeUp: () {
          // Action for swipe up
          print('Swiped Up!'); // Log swipe up action
        },
        onSwipeDown: () {
          // Action for swipe down
          print('Swiped Down!'); // Log swipe down action
        },
        child: Center(
          child: Text('Swipe in any direction!'), // Display message
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which is the main entry point.
// 2. The MaterialApp widget is created, setting the home to SwipeDetectorExample.
// 3. In SwipeDetectorExample, a Scaffold is built with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The SwipeDetector widget wraps around a Center widget that contains a Text widget.
// 5. The SwipeDetector listens for swipe gestures and triggers the corresponding actions.
// 6. When a swipe is detected, a message is printed to the console indicating the direction of the swipe.
