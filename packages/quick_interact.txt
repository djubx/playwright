# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Quick Interact

## Installation
To add the `quick_interact` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  quick_interact: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run the following command to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No specific configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your app requires any specific user interactions that need permissions.

## Basic Usage
To use the `quick_interact` package, you can start by importing it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:quick_interact/quick_interact.dart';
```

You can then create interactive widgets using the provided classes and methods. For example, to create a button that responds to taps:

```dart
QuickInteractButton(
  onTap: () {
    print("Button tapped!");
  },
  child: Text("Tap Me"),
);
```

This button will provide visual feedback when tapped, enhancing the user experience.

## Best Practices
- Always provide feedback for user interactions to improve usability.
- Use animations to make interactions feel more natural and engaging.
- Test on both Android and iOS devices to ensure consistent behavior.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively utilize the `quick_interact` package in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example: Using Quick Interact in a Flutter App

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:quick_interact/quick_interact.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Quick Interact Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Quick Interact Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: QuickInteractButton(
            // This is the button that will respond to taps
            onTap: () {
              // Action to perform when the button is tapped
              print("Button tapped!");
            },
            child: Container(
              padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
              color: Colors.blue,
              child: Text(
                "Tap Me",
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Quick Interact Demo".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers a QuickInteractButton.
// 5. When the button is tapped, it triggers the onTap callback, printing "Button tapped!" to the console.
// 6. The button is styled with padding and a blue background, making it visually appealing.
