# Overview of the `screen_protector` Flutter Package

The `screen_protector` package is a Flutter plugin designed to help developers manage screen protection features in their applications. This package is particularly useful for applications that require enhanced security, such as banking apps, sensitive data management tools, or any app where user privacy is a priority. 

## When to Use This Package
You should consider using the `screen_protector` package in scenarios such as:
- **Banking Applications**: To prevent screen capture and ensure sensitive information is not exposed.
- **Healthcare Apps**: Where patient data needs to be protected from unauthorized viewing.
- **Enterprise Applications**: To safeguard proprietary information from being captured or shared.

## Key Features
- **Screen Capture Prevention**: Disables the ability to take screenshots while the app is in use.
- **Overlay Protection**: Prevents other apps from overlaying on top of your app, which can be a security risk.
- **Customizable Settings**: Allows developers to configure the level of protection based on their app's requirements.

By leveraging the `screen_protector` package, developers can enhance the security of their applications and provide users with peace of mind regarding their data privacy.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the `screen_protector` Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the `screen_protector` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  screen_protector: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
For Android, you need to ensure that your app has the necessary permissions. Open the `AndroidManifest.xml` file located in `android/app/src/main/` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW"/>
```

### iOS Configuration
For iOS, you need to add a usage description in your `Info.plist` file to inform users why your app requires screen protection. Add the following key-value pair:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to prevent screen capture for security reasons.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement screen protection features.

# Complete Example of Using the `screen_protector` Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:screen_protector/screen_protector.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  bool _isScreenProtected = false;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the screen protector
    ScreenProtector.init();
  }

  void _toggleScreenProtection() {
    // Toggle screen protection on or off
    if (_isScreenProtected) {
      ScreenProtector.disable();
    } else {
      ScreenProtector.enable();
    }
    setState(() {
      _isScreenProtected = !_isScreenProtected;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Screen Protector Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text(
                _isScreenProtected
                    ? 'Screen Protection is ON'
                    : 'Screen Protection is OFF',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _toggleScreenProtection,
                child: Text(_isScreenProtected ? 'Disable Protection' : 'Enable Protection'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget, we initialize the screen protector in the initState method.
// 3. The _toggleScreenProtection method is called when the button is pressed, toggling the screen protection state.
// 4. The UI updates to reflect whether screen protection is enabled or disabled, providing feedback to the user.
