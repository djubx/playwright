# Datadog Tracking HTTP Client Flutter Package

The `datadog_tracking_http_client` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to integrate Datadog's APM (Application Performance Monitoring) capabilities into Flutter applications. This package allows developers to track HTTP requests and responses, providing insights into application performance and user interactions.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `datadog_tracking_http_client` package when:
- You want to monitor the performance of your Flutter application in real-time.
- You need to track HTTP requests and responses for debugging and performance analysis.
- You are already using Datadog for monitoring other parts of your application and want to maintain consistency.

## Features

- **Automatic Request Tracking**: Automatically tracks all HTTP requests made through the client.
- **Performance Metrics**: Collects and sends performance metrics to Datadog, including response times and error rates.
- **Customizable**: Allows customization of the tracking behavior to suit specific application needs.
- **Integration with Datadog**: Seamlessly integrates with existing Datadog setups, making it easy to visualize and analyze data.

By leveraging this package, developers can gain valuable insights into their applications, helping to identify bottlenecks and improve overall performance.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Datadog Tracking HTTP Client

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `datadog_tracking_http_client` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `datadog_tracking_http_client` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  datadog_tracking_http_client: ^1.0.0
```

## Step 2: Configure Datadog

Before using the package, you need to configure Datadog in your application. This involves setting up your Datadog API key and application ID. You can do this in your main application file.

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Add the following lines to the `android` block:

```groovy
buildTypes {
    release {
        // Add your Datadog API key here
        buildConfigField "String", "DATADOG_API_KEY", "\"YOUR_API_KEY\""
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys:

```xml
<key>DATADOG_API_KEY</key>
<string>YOUR_API_KEY</string>
<key>DATADOG_APP_ID</key>
<string>YOUR_APP_ID</string>
```

## Step 3: Initialize the Client

In your main application file, initialize the `RealFlutter` class and set up the HTTP client:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:datadog_tracking_http_client/datadog_tracking_http_client.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize Datadog
  DatadogTrackingHttpClient.initialize(
    apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
    applicationId: 'YOUR_APP_ID',
  );
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

## Step 4: Using the Client

You can now use the `DatadogTrackingHttpClient` to make HTTP requests. Hereâ€™s an example of how to use it in your application:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Datadog Tracking Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Make an HTTP request
              final response = await DatadogTrackingHttpClient.get(
                Uri.parse('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts'),
              );
              print('Response: ${response.body}');
            },
            child: Text('Make Request'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This setup allows you to track HTTP requests made through the `DatadogTrackingHttpClient`, sending performance metrics to Datadog.

# Complete Example of Datadog Tracking HTTP Client

Here is a complete example of a Flutter application using the `datadog_tracking_http_client` package. This example demonstrates how to set up the client and make a simple HTTP request.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:datadog_tracking_http_client/datadog_tracking_http_client.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize Datadog with your API key and application ID
  DatadogTrackingHttpClient.initialize(
    apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
    applicationId: 'YOUR_APP_ID',
  );
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Datadog Tracking Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Make an HTTP GET request to the specified URL
              final response = await DatadogTrackingHttpClient.get(
                Uri.parse('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts'),
              );
              // Print the response body to the console
              print('Response: ${response.body}');
            },
            child: Text('Make Request'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Datadog client with the API key and application ID.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which builds a MaterialApp with a simple UI.
// 3. The UI contains a button that, when pressed, triggers an HTTP GET request to a sample API.
// 4. The response from the API is printed to the console, and the request is tracked by Datadog.
// 5. This allows you to monitor the performance of the HTTP request in your Datadog dashboard.
