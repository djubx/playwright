This package provides a simple and efficient way to access the device's compass sensor, allowing developers to create applications that can display the current heading, track changes in orientation, and respond to user movements.

## When to Use This Package
You might consider using `flutter_compass_v2` in applications that require navigation features, augmented reality experiences, or any app that benefits from directional information. Examples include:

- Navigation apps that need to show the user's heading.
- Augmented reality applications that overlay information based on the user's orientation.
- Games that require directional input.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Heading Updates**: The package provides continuous updates of the device's heading.
- **User-Friendly API**: Easy to integrate and use within your Flutter applications.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_compass_v2

## Installation
To get started with `flutter_compass_v2`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_compass_v2: ^2.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you need to add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file to request permission for location services:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show the compass direction.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show the compass direction.</string>
```

## Using the Package
To use the `flutter_compass_v2` package, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:
   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter_compass_v2/flutter_compass_v2.dart';
   ```

2. Create a stateful widget to manage the compass functionality.

3. Use the `FlutterCompass` class to access the heading data.

4. Update the UI based on the heading changes.

Here’s a simple example of how to implement the compass in your Flutter app.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_compass_v2/flutter_compass_v2.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to hold the current heading
  double? _heading;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Start listening to compass updates
    FlutterCompass.events!.listen((heading) {
      // Update the heading state when new data is received
      setState(() {
        _heading = heading.heading;
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Compass Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: _heading != null
              ? Text(
                  'Heading: ${_heading!.toStringAsFixed(2)}°',
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
                )
              : CircularProgressIndicator(), // Show loading indicator until heading is available
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the compass event listener when the widget is removed
    super.dispose();
  }
}
```

// The above code creates a simple Flutter application that displays the current heading from the device's compass.
// 1. The `main` function initializes the app by running the `RealFlutter` widget.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` widget is a stateful widget that manages the compass functionality.
// 3. In the `initState` method, we start listening to compass events using `FlutterCompass.events`.
// 4. When a new heading is received, we update the `_heading` variable and call `setState` to refresh the UI.
// 5. The `build` method displays the current heading or a loading indicator if the heading is not yet available.
// 6. Finally, we override the `dispose` method to clean up the event listener when the widget is removed from the widget tree.
