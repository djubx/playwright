# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Gradient Slide to Act

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **gradient_slide_to_act** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  gradient_slide_to_act: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:gradient_slide_to_act/gradient_slide_to_act.dart';
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your `ios/Podfile` has the platform set to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Widget

You can now use the `GradientSlideToAct` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
GradientSlideToAct(
  gradient: LinearGradient(
    colors: [Colors.blue, Colors.purple],
  ),
  action: () {
    // Define the action to be performed on slide
    print("Action performed!");
  },
  child: Container(
    height: 60,
    alignment: Alignment.center,
    child: Text(
      "Slide to Confirm",
      style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 18),
    ),
  ),
);
```

This code snippet creates a sliding action widget with a gradient background and a text label. The action is triggered when the user slides the widget.

# Complete Example of Gradient Slide to Act

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gradient_slide_to_act/gradient_slide_to_act.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Gradient Slide to Act Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Gradient Slide to Act'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: GradientSlideToAct(
            // Define the gradient colors for the background
            gradient: LinearGradient(
              colors: [Colors.blue, Colors.purple],
            ),
            // Action to perform when the slide is completed
            action: () {
              // This is where you define what happens after the slide
              print("Action performed!");
            },
            // Child widget that will be displayed
            child: Container(
              height: 60,
              alignment: Alignment.center,
              // Text displayed on the sliding widget
              child: Text(
                "Slide to Confirm",
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 18),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. The Center widget contains the GradientSlideToAct widget, which has a gradient background and an action callback.
// 4. When the user slides the widget, the action callback is triggered, printing "Action performed!" to the console.
// 5. The child of the GradientSlideToAct is a Container that displays the text "Slide to Confirm" in the center.
```
