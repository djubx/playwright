# Tutorial: Setting Up the Country Picker Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **country_picker** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **country_picker** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  country_picker: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` file to include permissions for location services if your app uses them. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to provide better services.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Country Picker

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is an example of how to implement the country picker in a simple app.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:country_picker/country_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Country Picker Example',
      home: CountryPickerExample(),
    );
  }
}

class CountryPickerExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CountryPickerExampleState createState() => _CountryPickerExampleState();
}

class _CountryPickerExampleState extends State<CountryPickerExample> {
  String? selectedCountry; // Variable to hold the selected country

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Country Picker Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the selected country or a placeholder
            Text(
              selectedCountry ?? 'Select a country',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Open the country picker dialog
                showCountryPicker(
                  context: context,
                  onSelect: (Country country) {
                    setState(() {
                      selectedCountry = country.name; // Update the selected country
                    });
                  },
                );
              },
              child: Text('Pick a Country'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home widget.
// 3. The CountryPickerExample widget is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the selected country.
// 4. In the build method, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget containing a Column.
// 5. The Column displays the selected country or a placeholder text and a button to open the country picker.
// 6. When the button is pressed, the showCountryPicker function is called, which opens the country selection dialog.
// 7. Upon selecting a country, the onSelect callback updates the selectedCountry state, which triggers a rebuild to display the selected country.
```
