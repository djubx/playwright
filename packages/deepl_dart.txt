# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using deepl_dart

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `deepl_dart` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the `deepl_dart` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  deepl_dart: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Configure API Key
You need to obtain an API key from DeepL. Sign up on the [DeepL website](https://www.deepl.com/pro#developer) and get your API key. Once you have it, store it securely in your application.

### Android Configuration
For Android, ensure that you have internet permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration
For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `Info.plist` to allow network requests:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is an example of how to use the `deepl_dart` package to translate text.

# Complete Example: Using deepl_dart in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:deepl_dart/deepl_dart.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'DeepL Translation Example',
      home: TranslationScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class TranslationScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _TranslationScreenState createState() => _TranslationScreenState();
}

class _TranslationScreenState extends State<TranslationScreen> {
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController();
  String _translatedText = '';
  final String _apiKey = 'YOUR_DEEPL_API_KEY'; // Replace with your DeepL API key

  // Function to translate text using DeepL API
  Future<void> _translateText() async {
    // Create an instance of the DeepL translator
    final translator = DeepLTranslator(apiKey: _apiKey);
    
    // Call the translate method with the text and target language
    final response = await translator.translate(
      text: _controller.text,
      targetLang: 'ES', // Translate to Spanish
    );

    // Update the state with the translated text
    setState(() {
      _translatedText = response.translations.first.text;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('DeepL Translation Example'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              controller: _controller,
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Enter text to translate',
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _translateText,
              child: Text('Translate'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(
              'Translated Text: $_translatedText',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (TranslationScreen).
// 3. The TranslationScreen contains a TextField for user input, a button to trigger translation, and a Text widget to display the translated text.
// 4. When the user enters text and presses the "Translate" button, the _translateText function is called.
// 5. Inside _translateText, a DeepLTranslator instance is created using the provided API key.
// 6. The translate method is called with the input text and the target language (Spanish in this case).
// 7. The translated text is retrieved from the response and displayed on the screen.
```
