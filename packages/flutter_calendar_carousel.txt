### Setting Up `flutter_calendar_carousel`

To get started with the `flutter_calendar_carousel` package, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

  flutter_calendar_carousel: ^2.3.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

#### Step 2: Install Packages

Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

#### Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

**For Android:**
- Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

**For iOS:**
- Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and ensure you have the following permissions if you plan to access the device's calendar:

```xml

<string>This app requires access to your calendar.</string>
```

#### Step 4: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_calendar_carousel/flutter_calendar_carousel.dart';
```

#### Step 5: Basic Usage

You can now use the `CalendarCarousel` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
CalendarCarousel(
  onDayPressed: (DateTime date, List<Event> events) {
    // Handle date selection
    print(date);
  },
  daysHaveCircularBorder: false,
)
```

This basic setup will allow you to display a calendar and respond to date selections.

### Additional Configuration

      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp and its title.
// 3. The CalendarHome widget is created, which is a StatefulWidget to manage the selected date state.
// 4. In the CalendarHomeState, the current date and selected date are stored.
// 5. The build method constructs the UI, displaying the selected date and the CalendarCarousel.
// 6. When a day is pressed on the calendar, the selected date is updated and displayed.
// 7. The calendar also highlights weekends and marks specific dates with events.
```

### Summary of Application Flow

The application begins by initializing the `RealFlutter` widget, which sets up a `MaterialApp`. The `CalendarHome` widget is a stateful widget that manages the current and selected dates. The UI consists of a text display for the selected date and a `CalendarCarousel` widget. When a user selects a date, the app updates the displayed date accordingly. The calendar also features styling for weekends and the ability to mark specific dates with events, enhancing the user experience.
