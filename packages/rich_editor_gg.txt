# Setting Up and Using rich_editor_gg

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `rich_editor_gg` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Installation

To add the `rich_editor_gg` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  rich_editor_gg: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/rich_editor_gg).

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file, especially if you plan to allow image uploads. Add the following keys:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to upload images.</string>
```

## Basic Usage

To use the `rich_editor_gg` package, you can create a simple rich text editor widget in your Flutter application. Here’s how to do it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:rich_editor_gg/rich_editor_gg.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Rich Editor Example'),
        ),
        body: RichEditor(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class RichEditor extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RichEditorState createState() => _RichEditorState();
}

class _RichEditorState extends State<RichEditor> {
  final RichEditorController _controller = RichEditorController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        Expanded(
          child: RichEditor(
            controller: _controller,
            onChanged: (text) {
              // Handle text changes
            },
          ),
        ),
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Handle save action
            String content = _controller.getText();
            print(content); // Print the content to console
          },
          child: Text('Save'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic rich text editor with a save button. The `RichEditorController` is used to manage the text content.

# Complete Example of rich_editor_gg

Here’s a complete example of a Flutter application using the `rich_editor_gg` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:rich_editor_gg/rich_editor_gg.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Rich Editor Example'),
        ),
        body: RichEditor(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class RichEditor extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RichEditorState createState() => _RichEditorState();
}

class _RichEditorState extends State<RichEditor> {
  // Create a controller for the rich editor
  final RichEditorController _controller = RichEditorController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        Expanded(
          child: RichEditor(
            controller: _controller,
            onChanged: (text) {
              // This callback is triggered when the text changes
              // You can handle the text changes here
            },
          ),
        ),
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // When the button is pressed, get the text from the editor
            String content = _controller.getText();
            print(content); // Print the content to the console
          },
          child: Text('Save'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and the RichEditor widget.
// 3. The RichEditor widget maintains its state using _RichEditorState.
// 4. Inside _RichEditorState, a RichEditorController is created to manage the text content.
// 5. The RichEditor widget is displayed, allowing users to input and format text.
// 6. When the "Save" button is pressed, the current text content is retrieved from the controller and printed to the console.
```
