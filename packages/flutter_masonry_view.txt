# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_masonry_view

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_masonry_view` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_masonry_view: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_masonry_view).

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_masonry_view/flutter_masonry_view.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Masonry View

You can now use the `MasonryView` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
MasonryView(
  itemCount: items.length,
  itemBuilder: (context, index) {
    return Container(
      color: Colors.blue,
      height: (index % 2 == 0) ? 150 : 200, // Varying heights for demonstration
      child: Center(child: Text('Item $index')),
    );
  },
)
```

This code snippet creates a masonry layout with items of varying heights.

# Complete Example of flutter_masonry_view

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_masonry_view/flutter_masonry_view.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Masonry View Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Masonry View Example'),
        ),
        body: MasonryView(
          itemCount: 20, // Total number of items to display
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            // Building each item in the masonry view
            return Container(
              color: Colors.blue[(index % 9 + 1) * 100], // Different shades of blue
              height: (index % 2 == 0) ? 150 : 200, // Alternating heights for items
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'Item $index',
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
                ),
              ),
            );
          },
          // Optional: Customize spacing between items
          mainAxisSpacing: 8.0,
          crossAxisSpacing: 8.0,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body consists of a MasonryView widget that displays a grid of items.
// 5. The itemCount specifies how many items to display, and itemBuilder creates each item.
// 6. Each item is a Container with a varying height and a centered text label.
// 7. The colors of the items are dynamically generated based on the index, creating a visually appealing layout.
// 8. MainAxisSpacing and CrossAxisSpacing are used to add space between the items in the masonry layout.
