# Setting Up and Using the Slide Countdown Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up the `slide_countdown` package in a Flutter project and demonstrate its usage with platform-specific configurations for both Android and iOS.

## Installation

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `slide_countdown` package.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     slide_countdown: ^1.0.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the new package.

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

Ensure your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure your `Podfile` is using a platform version of at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package

To use the `slide_countdown` package, import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:slide_countdown/slide_countdown.dart';
```

You can now integrate the countdown widget into your app's UI. Below is a simple example of how to use the `SlideCountdown` widget:

```dart
SlideCountdown(
  duration: Duration(hours: 1),
  slideDirection: SlideDirection.down,
  separatorType: SeparatorType.title,
  onDone: () {
    print('Countdown Ended');
  },
)
```

<-- MAIN -->

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:slide_countdown/slide_countdown.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Slide Countdown Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: CountdownHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class CountdownHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CountdownHomePageState createState() => _CountdownHomePageState();
}

class _CountdownHomePageState extends State<CountdownHomePage> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Slide Countdown Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: SlideCountdown(
          // Set the countdown duration to 1 hour
          duration: Duration(hours: 1),
          // Choose the slide direction for the countdown animation
          slideDirection: SlideDirection.down,
          // Set the separator type between time units
          separatorType: SeparatorType.title,
          // Define the action to take when the countdown ends
          onDone: () {
            // Display a message when the countdown completes
            ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
              SnackBar(content: Text('Countdown Ended')),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to CountdownHomePage, a StatefulWidget.
// 4. CountdownHomePage builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a centered SlideCountdown widget.
// 5. SlideCountdown is configured with a 1-hour duration, sliding animation, and a title separator.
// 6. When the countdown reaches zero, a SnackBar is displayed with the message 'Countdown Ended'.
```

In this complete example, we have demonstrated how to integrate the `slide_countdown` package into a Flutter application. The app initializes with a `RealFlutter` widget, which sets up the main structure using `MaterialApp`. The `CountdownHomePage` widget contains the `SlideCountdown` widget, which is configured to count down from one hour. The countdown features a sliding animation and displays a message when it completes. This example showcases the package's ability to create engaging countdowns with minimal setup.
