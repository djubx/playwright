# Tutorial: Setting Up flutter_headset_detector

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the `flutter_headset_detector` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_headset_detector: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_headset_detector).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED" />
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to request permission for audio input:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio input.</string>
```

## Step 3: Import the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_headset_detector/flutter_headset_detector.dart';
```

## Step 4: Initialize and Use the Detector
You can now initialize the headset detector in your main application file. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use it:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: HeadsetDetectorScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HeadsetDetectorScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HeadsetDetectorScreenState createState() => _HeadsetDetectorScreenState();
}

class _HeadsetDetectorScreenState extends State<HeadsetDetectorScreen> {
  String _headsetStatus = "Headset not connected";

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the headset detector
    HeadsetDetector.headsetStatus.listen((status) {
      setState(() {
        _headsetStatus = status ? "Headset connected" : "Headset not connected";
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Headset Detector")),
      body: Center(child: Text(_headsetStatus)),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a simple Flutter application that listens for headset connection changes and updates the UI accordingly.

# Complete Example of flutter_headset_detector

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_headset_detector/flutter_headset_detector.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: HeadsetDetectorScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HeadsetDetectorScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HeadsetDetectorScreenState createState() => _HeadsetDetectorScreenState();
}

class _HeadsetDetectorScreenState extends State<HeadsetDetectorScreen> {
  // Variable to hold the headset connection status
  String _headsetStatus = "Headset not connected";

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the headset detector and listen for status changes
    HeadsetDetector.headsetStatus.listen((status) {
      // Update the headset status based on the connection state
      setState(() {
        _headsetStatus = status ? "Headset connected" : "Headset not connected";
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Headset Detector")),
      body: Center(
        // Display the current headset status
        child: Text(
          _headsetStatus,
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with HeadsetDetectorScreen as the home widget.
// 3. HeadsetDetectorScreen is a StatefulWidget that manages the headset status.
// 4. In the initState method, we listen for headset connection changes using HeadsetDetector.headsetStatus.
// 5. When the headset status changes, we update the _headsetStatus variable and call setState to refresh the UI.
// 6. The build method displays the current headset status in the center of the screen.
```
