# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Multi Circular Slider

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the **multi_circular_slider** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  multi_circular_slider: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:multi_circular_slider/multi_circular_slider.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Multi Circular Slider

You can now use the `MultiCircularSlider` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
MultiCircularSlider(
  sliders: [
    SliderData(
      value: 30,
      color: Colors.red,
      onChanged: (value) {
        // Handle value change
      },
    ),
    SliderData(
      value: 70,
      color: Colors.blue,
      onChanged: (value) {
        // Handle value change
      },
    ),
  ],
)
```

This code snippet creates a circular slider with two handles, one red and one blue, allowing users to adjust their values independently.

# Complete Example of Multi Circular Slider

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:multi_circular_slider/multi_circular_slider.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Multi Circular Slider Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Multi Circular Slider Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: MultiCircularSlider(
            sliders: [
              // First slider handle with initial value 30
              SliderData(
                value: 30,
                color: Colors.red,
                onChanged: (value) {
                  // Update the state or perform an action when the value changes
                  print('Red Slider Value: $value');
                },
              ),
              // Second slider handle with initial value 70
              SliderData(
                value: 70,
                color: Colors.blue,
                onChanged: (value) {
                  // Update the state or perform an action when the value changes
                  print('Blue Slider Value: $value');
                },
              ),
            ],
            // Set the size of the slider
            size: 300,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Multi Circular Slider Demo".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers the MultiCircularSlider widget.
// 5. The MultiCircularSlider is configured with two sliders, each with its own initial value and color.
// 6. When the user interacts with the sliders, the onChanged callback is triggered, printing the new value to the console.
// 7. The size of the slider is set to 300, making it visually appealing and easy to interact with.
