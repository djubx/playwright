# Carrier Info Flutter Package

The `carrier_info` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to retrieve information about the mobile carrier of the device on which the application is running. This package is particularly useful for applications that require carrier-specific functionalities, such as SMS services, billing, or location-based services. 

## When to Use

You might want to use the `carrier_info` package in scenarios such as:
- **Telecom Applications**: Apps that provide services based on the user's mobile carrier.
- **Location-Based Services**: Applications that need to tailor their services based on the carrier's coverage.
- **User Analytics**: Gathering data about users' carriers for better targeting and service optimization.

## Features

- **Carrier Name**: Retrieve the name of the mobile carrier.
- **Country Code**: Get the country code associated with the carrier.
- **Network Type**: Determine the type of network (e.g., LTE, 3G) the device is currently using.
- **SIM Information**: Access details about the SIM card, including its state and serial number.

The `carrier_info` package simplifies the process of accessing carrier-related information, making it an essential tool for developers looking to enhance their applications with carrier-specific features.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Carrier Info Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `carrier_info` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  carrier_info: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/carrier_info).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE"/>
```

This permission is required to access carrier information.

### iOS

For iOS, you need to add the following key to your `Info.plist` file to request permission to access carrier information:

```xml
<key>NSContactsUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your carrier information.</string>
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:carrier_info/carrier_info.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the `CarrierInfo` class to retrieve carrier information. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
void getCarrierInfo() async {
  CarrierInfo carrierInfo = await CarrierInfo.getCarrierInfo();
  print('Carrier Name: ${carrierInfo.carrierName}');
  print('Country Code: ${carrierInfo.countryCode}');
  print('Network Type: ${carrierInfo.networkType}');
}
```

This function retrieves and prints the carrier name, country code, and network type.

## Step 5: Handling Permissions

Make sure to handle permissions properly, especially on Android 6.0 (API level 23) and above, where you need to request permissions at runtime.

```dart
if (await Permission.phone.request().isGranted) {
  getCarrierInfo();
} else {
  // Handle the case when permission is denied
}
```

With these steps, you are now ready to use the `carrier_info` package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Using the Carrier Info Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:carrier_info/carrier_info.dart';
import 'package:permission_handler/permission_handler.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Carrier Info Example',
      home: CarrierInfoScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class CarrierInfoScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CarrierInfoScreenState createState() => _CarrierInfoScreenState();
}

class _CarrierInfoScreenState extends State<CarrierInfoScreen> {
  String carrierName = 'Unknown';
  String countryCode = 'Unknown';
  String networkType = 'Unknown';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _getCarrierInfo();
  }

  // Function to get carrier information
  void _getCarrierInfo() async {
    // Check for phone permission
    if (await Permission.phone.request().isGranted) {
      // Retrieve carrier information
      CarrierInfo carrierInfo = await CarrierInfo.getCarrierInfo();
      setState(() {
        carrierName = carrierInfo.carrierName; // Set carrier name
        countryCode = carrierInfo.countryCode; // Set country code
        networkType = carrierInfo.networkType; // Set network type
      });
    } else {
      // Handle the case when permission is denied
      setState(() {
        carrierName = 'Permission Denied';
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Carrier Info'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Carrier Name: $carrierName'),
            Text('Country Code: $countryCode'),
            Text('Network Type: $networkType'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets CarrierInfoScreen as the home widget.
// 3. CarrierInfoScreen is a stateful widget that initializes the carrier information in its state.
// 4. In the initState method, _getCarrierInfo is called to fetch the carrier details.
// 5. _getCarrierInfo checks for phone permission and retrieves carrier information if granted.
// 6. The retrieved information is displayed in the UI using Text widgets.
// 7. If permission is denied, it updates the UI to indicate that permission was denied.
