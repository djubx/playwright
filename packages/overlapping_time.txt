# Overlapping Time Flutter Package

The **overlapping_time** Flutter package is designed to help developers manage and visualize overlapping time intervals effectively. This package is particularly useful in applications that require scheduling, calendar management, or any scenario where time intervals may overlap, such as booking systems or event planners.

## When to Use This Package
- **Scheduling Applications**: When you need to manage events that may overlap in time.
- **Calendar Management**: For applications that display multiple events on a calendar view.
- **Resource Allocation**: In scenarios where resources (like rooms or equipment) are booked for overlapping times.

## Features
- **Interval Management**: Easily create and manage time intervals.
- **Overlap Detection**: Automatically detect overlapping intervals.
- **Customizable**: Offers options to customize the behavior and appearance of time intervals.
- **Performance Optimized**: Designed to handle a large number of intervals efficiently.

This package simplifies the complexity of managing overlapping time intervals, making it a valuable tool for Flutter developers.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Overlapping Time Package

## Installation
To use the **overlapping_time** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  overlapping_time: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Then, run the following command to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your application requires access to any device features that may affect time management.

## Basic Usage
To use the package, you will typically create instances of time intervals and check for overlaps. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to get started:

```dart
import 'package:overlapping_time/overlapping_time.dart';

void main() {
  // Create some time intervals
  final interval1 = TimeInterval(start: DateTime(2023, 10, 1, 10, 0), end: DateTime(2023, 10, 1, 12, 0));
  final interval2 = TimeInterval(start: DateTime(2023, 10, 1, 11, 0), end: DateTime(2023, 10, 1, 13, 0));

  // Check for overlap
  final hasOverlap = interval1.overlapsWith(interval2);
  print('Do the intervals overlap? $hasOverlap');
}
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to create time intervals and check if they overlap. The `overlapsWith` method returns a boolean indicating whether the two intervals overlap.

With this setup, you can start integrating the **overlapping_time** package into your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Overlapping Time Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:overlapping_time/overlapping_time.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Overlapping Time Example',
      home: OverlappingTimeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class OverlappingTimeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create some sample time intervals
    final List<TimeInterval> intervals = [
      TimeInterval(start: DateTime(2023, 10, 1, 10, 0), end: DateTime(2023, 10, 1, 12, 0)),
      TimeInterval(start: DateTime(2023, 10, 1, 11, 0), end: DateTime(2023, 10, 1, 13, 0)),
      TimeInterval(start: DateTime(2023, 10, 1, 14, 0), end: DateTime(2023, 10, 1, 15, 0)),
    ];

    // Check for overlaps and store results
    List<String> overlapResults = [];
    for (int i = 0; i < intervals.length; i++) {
      for (int j = i + 1; j < intervals.length; j++) {
        if (intervals[i].overlapsWith(intervals[j])) {
          overlapResults.add('Interval ${i + 1} overlaps with Interval ${j + 1}');
        }
      }
    }

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Overlapping Time Example'),
      ),
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: overlapResults.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return ListTile(
            title: Text(overlapResults[index]),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets the home to OverlappingTimeScreen.
// 3. In OverlappingTimeScreen, we create a list of TimeInterval objects representing different time slots.
// 4. We then check for overlaps between these intervals using nested loops.
// 5. If an overlap is detected, we store the result in the overlapResults list.
// 6. Finally, we display the results in a ListView, where each overlapping interval is shown as a ListTile.
