# flutter_phone_number_field Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To use the `flutter_phone_number_field` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_phone_number_field: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_phone_number_field).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to access the internet and read phone state if required. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you are accessing any phone-related features. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSContactsUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your contacts.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your photo library.</string>
```

## Usage Example
To use the `flutter_phone_number_field`, you can create a simple form in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_phone_number_field/flutter_phone_number_field.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Phone Number Input Example')),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: PhoneNumberField(
            decoration: InputDecoration(
              labelText: 'Phone Number',
              border: OutlineInputBorder(),
            ),
            onChanged: (value) {
              // Handle the phone number input change
              print('Phone number: $value');
            },
            validator: (value) {
              // Validate the phone number
              if (value == null || value.isEmpty) {
                return 'Please enter a phone number';
              }
              return null;
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with a phone number input field. The `PhoneNumberField` widget is used to capture the user's phone number, and we provide a basic validation to ensure that the field is not empty.

# Complete Example of flutter_phone_number_field

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_phone_number_field/flutter_phone_number_field.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Phone Number Input Example')),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: PhoneNumberField(
            decoration: InputDecoration(
              labelText: 'Phone Number', // Label for the input field
              border: OutlineInputBorder(), // Styling the input field
            ),
            onChanged: (value) {
              // This callback is triggered when the phone number changes
              print('Phone number: $value'); // Print the current phone number
            },
            validator: (value) {
              // Validate the phone number input
              if (value == null || value.isEmpty) {
                return 'Please enter a phone number'; // Error message if empty
              }
              return null; // Return null if the input is valid
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application starts with the RealFlutter class, which builds a MaterialApp.
// Inside the MaterialApp, we have a Scaffold that contains an AppBar and a body.
// The body consists of a PhoneNumberField widget wrapped in Padding for spacing.
// The PhoneNumberField has a label, a border, and callbacks for input changes and validation.
// When the user types in the phone number, it triggers the onChanged callback, printing the value.
// The validator checks if the input is empty and returns an error message if it is.
// This simple setup allows users to input and validate their phone numbers easily.
```
