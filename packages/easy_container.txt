# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Easy Container

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **easy_container** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  easy_container: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the platform version in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using Easy Container

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a responsive container using the **easy_container** package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:easy_container/easy_container.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Easy Container Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: EasyContainer(
            width: 200,
            height: 200,
            padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
            margin: EdgeInsets.all(10),
            borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(15),
            color: Colors.blue,
            child: Center(child: Text('Hello, Easy Container!')),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple application that displays a blue container with rounded corners and some text inside it.

# Complete Example of Easy Container

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:easy_container/easy_container.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Easy Container Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Center widget to align the EasyContainer in the middle of the screen
          child: EasyContainer(
            width: 200, // Set the width of the container
            height: 200, // Set the height of the container
            padding: EdgeInsets.all(20), // Add padding inside the container
            margin: EdgeInsets.all(10), // Add margin outside the container
            borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(15), // Round the corners of the container
            color: Colors.blue, // Set the background color of the container
            child: Center(
              // Center widget to align the text inside the container
              child: Text(
                'Hello, Easy Container!', // Text displayed inside the container
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20), // Style the text
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter application
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application, which calls runApp().
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the UI.
// 3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// 4. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. The Center widget holds an EasyContainer, which is a customizable container.
// 6. The EasyContainer has specified width, height, padding, margin, border radius, and color.
// 7. Inside the EasyContainer, another Center widget is used to align the text.
// 8. The text "Hello, Easy Container!" is displayed in white color with a font size of 20.
// 9. The application is responsive and will adjust the layout based on the device screen size.
```
