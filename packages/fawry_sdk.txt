# Tutorial: Setting Up Fawry SDK in Your Flutter Application

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the Fawry SDK Flutter package and demonstrate how to use it in your application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the Fawry SDK package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  fawry_sdk: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/fawry_sdk).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. Ensure you have the correct deployment target set in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Initialize the SDK

In your Flutter application, you need to initialize the Fawry SDK. This is typically done in the `main.dart` file.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fawry_sdk/fawry_sdk.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Fawry SDK Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Using the SDK

You can now use the Fawry SDK to initiate a payment. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to do this:

```dart
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Fawry Payment')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () async {
            // Initialize the payment
            final result = await FawrySdk.startPayment(
              amount: 100.0, // Amount to be paid
              orderId: '12345', // Unique order ID
              description: 'Payment for order 12345', // Description of the payment
            );

            // Handle the payment result
            if (result.isSuccess) {
              // Payment was successful
              print('Payment successful: ${result.transactionId}');
            } else {
              // Payment failed
              print('Payment failed: ${result.errorMessage}');
            }
          },
          child: Text('Pay Now'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Fawry SDK Integration

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fawry_sdk/fawry_sdk.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Fawry SDK Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Fawry Payment')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () async {
            // Start the payment process
            final result = await FawrySdk.startPayment(
              amount: 100.0, // Amount to be paid
              orderId: '12345', // Unique order ID
              description: 'Payment for order 12345', // Description of the payment
            );

            // Check the result of the payment
            if (result.isSuccess) {
              // If payment is successful, print the transaction ID
              print('Payment successful: ${result.transactionId}');
            } else {
              // If payment fails, print the error message
              print('Payment failed: ${result.errorMessage}');
            }
          },
          child: Text('Pay Now'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The HomeScreen widget is displayed, containing a button labeled "Pay Now."
// 3. When the button is pressed, the Fawry SDK's startPayment method is called with the payment details.
// 4. The SDK processes the payment and returns a result.
// 5. If the payment is successful, the transaction ID is printed to the console.
// 6. If the payment fails, the error message is printed to the console.
```
