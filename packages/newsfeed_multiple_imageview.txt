# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `newsfeed_multiple_imageview`

## Installation
To get started with the `newsfeed_multiple_imageview` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  newsfeed_multiple_imageview: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/newsfeed_multiple_imageview).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` to allow for image loading from the internet if you are using network images:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Using the Package
Once the package is installed and configured, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `newsfeed_multiple_imageview` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:newsfeed_multiple_imageview/newsfeed_multiple_imageview.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Newsfeed Multiple Image View Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: NewsFeedMultipleImageView(
            images: [
              'https://example.com/image1.jpg',
              'https://example.com/image2.jpg',
              'https://example.com/image3.jpg',
            ],
            // Additional customization options can be added here
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application that displays multiple images in a news feed format using the `newsfeed_multiple_imageview` package.

# Complete Example of `newsfeed_multiple_imageview`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:newsfeed_multiple_imageview/newsfeed_multiple_imageview.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Newsfeed Multiple Image View Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: NewsFeedMultipleImageView(
            images: [
              'https://example.com/image1.jpg', // First image URL
              'https://example.com/image2.jpg', // Second image URL
              'https://example.com/image3.jpg', // Third image URL
            ],
            // You can customize the layout and appearance here
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Entry point of the application
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the Flutter application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the main UI.
// 3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// 4. The AppBar displays the title of the application.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 6. The NewsFeedMultipleImageView widget is used to display multiple images.
// 7. The images are provided as a list of URLs, which the package handles to display them in a news feed format.
// 8. The application is run using the runApp function, which takes the RealFlutter widget as an argument.
