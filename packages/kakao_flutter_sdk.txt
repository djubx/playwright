# Kakao Flutter SDK: Setup and Usage Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `kakao_flutter_sdk` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `kakao_flutter_sdk` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  kakao_flutter_sdk: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/kakao_flutter_sdk).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions and metadata:

```xml
<manifest>
    <application>
        ...
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.kakao.sdk.AppKey"
            android:value="YOUR_KAKAO_APP_KEY" />
    </application>
</manifest>
```

Replace `YOUR_KAKAO_APP_KEY` with your actual Kakao app key.

2. **Enable Internet Permission**: Ensure you have the following permission in the same `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following entries:

```xml
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
    <dict>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
        <array>
            <string>kakaoYOUR_KAKAO_APP_KEY</string>
        </array>
    </dict>
</array>
```

Replace `YOUR_KAKAO_APP_KEY` with your actual Kakao app key.

2. **Enable App Transport Security**: Add the following to allow HTTP requests:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have configured the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating user login.

# Complete Example of Kakao Flutter SDK

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:kakao_flutter_sdk/all.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Kakao Flutter SDK Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  String _userInfo = "Not logged in";

  // Function to handle Kakao login
  Future<void> _loginWithKakao() async {
    try {
      // Initiate the login process
      final authCode = await AuthCodeClient.instance.requestWithTalk();
      // Exchange the auth code for an access token
      final token = await AuthApi.instance.issueAccessToken(authCode);
      // Retrieve user information
      final user = await UserApi.instance.me();
      setState(() {
        _userInfo = "Logged in as: ${user.kakaoAccount?.profile?.nickname}";
      });
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        _userInfo = "Login failed: $e";
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Kakao Login Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(_userInfo),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _loginWithKakao,
              child: Text('Login with Kakao'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget maintains the state of the user information.
// 4. When the user presses the "Login with Kakao" button, the _loginWithKakao function is called.
// 5. This function requests an authentication code from Kakao, exchanges it for an access token, and retrieves the user's profile information.
// 6. The user information is then displayed on the screen, updating the UI accordingly.
```
