# Understanding the `robots_txt` Flutter Package

## <-- START_DESCRIPTION -->

### Description

The `robots_txt` package for Flutter is designed to help developers easily parse and manage `robots.txt` files, which are used by websites to communicate with web crawlers and bots about which pages should not be accessed. This package is particularly useful for developers working on web scraping, SEO tools, or any application that interacts with web content.

### When to Use

You might want to use the `robots_txt` package in scenarios such as:
- Building a web crawler that respects the rules set by websites.
- Developing SEO tools that analyze website accessibility.
- Creating applications that need to check if certain pages are allowed to be crawled.

### Features

- **Parsing**: Easily parse `robots.txt` files from a given URL.
- **Rule Evaluation**: Check if a specific user-agent is allowed to access a particular URL.
- **Support for Multiple User-Agents**: Handle rules for different user-agents defined in the `robots.txt` file.
- **Error Handling**: Manage errors gracefully when fetching or parsing the `robots.txt` file.

### Tutorial

#### Installation

To use the `robots_txt` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  robots_txt: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

#### Platform-Specific Details

The `robots_txt` package is platform-agnostic, meaning it works seamlessly on both Android and iOS without any additional configurations. However, ensure that your app has internet permissions to fetch the `robots.txt` file from a URL.

For Android, ensure you have the following permission in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

For iOS, no additional permissions are required, but ensure your app's Info.plist allows for network requests.

#### Basic Usage

Here’s how to use the `robots_txt` package in your Flutter application:

1. Import the package:
   ```dart
   import 'package:robots_txt/robots_txt.dart';
   ```

2. Fetch and parse a `robots.txt` file:
   ```dart
   Future<void> fetchRobotsTxt() async {
     final robots = await RobotsTxt.fetch('https://example.com/robots.txt');
     // Check if a specific user-agent can access a URL
     final isAllowed = robots.isAllowed('User-Agent', '/some-page');
     print('Is allowed: $isAllowed');
   }
   ```

### Complete Example

Here’s a complete Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the `robots_txt` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:robots_txt/robots_txt.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Robots.txt Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Robots.txt Checker'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: FutureBuilder<bool>(
            future: checkRobotsTxt(),
            builder: (context, snapshot) {
              if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                return CircularProgressIndicator(); // Show loading indicator
              } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
                return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}'); // Show error message
              } else {
                return Text(snapshot.data! ? 'Access Allowed' : 'Access Denied'); // Show access result
              }
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to fetch and check robots.txt
  Future<bool> checkRobotsTxt() async {
    try {
      // Fetch the robots.txt file from the specified URL
      final robots = await RobotsTxt.fetch('https://example.com/robots.txt');
      // Check if the user-agent is allowed to access a specific URL
      return robots.isAllowed('User-Agent', '/some-page');
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during fetching or parsing
      print('Error fetching robots.txt: $e');
      return false; // Default to false if there's an error
    }
  }
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation

// The application starts by running the `main` function, which initializes the `RealFlutter` widget.
// The `RealFlutter` widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a simple UI.
// Inside the body, a `FutureBuilder` is used to handle the asynchronous operation of fetching the `robots.txt` file.
// The `checkRobotsTxt` function is called to fetch the `robots.txt` file from the specified URL.
// If the connection is still waiting, a loading indicator is shown.
// If an error occurs during fetching, it displays the error message.
// Once the data is fetched, it checks if the user-agent is allowed to access a specific URL and displays the result accordingly.
// The `checkRobotsTxt` function handles the fetching and parsing of the `robots.txt` file, returning a boolean value based on the access rules defined in the file.
