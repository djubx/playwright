# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the HTML to PDF Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the `html_to_pdf` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  html_to_pdf: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following permissions to allow file access:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save PDFs.</string>
<key>NSDocumentsDirectoryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your documents directory to save PDFs.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to convert HTML to PDF.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:html_to_pdf/html_to_pdf.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('HTML to PDF Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Define the HTML content
              String htmlContent = """
                <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
                <p>This is a PDF generated from HTML content.</p>
              """;

              // Convert HTML to PDF
              var pdfFile = await HtmlToPdf.convertFromHtml(
                htmlContent,
                filename: 'example.pdf',
              );

              // Notify user of success
              ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                SnackBar(content: Text('PDF saved to ${pdfFile.path}')),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Generate PDF'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, the HTML content is converted to a PDF file and saved to the device.

# Complete Example of HTML to PDF in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:html_to_pdf/html_to_pdf.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('HTML to PDF Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Define the HTML content to be converted to PDF
              String htmlContent = """
                <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
                <p>This is a PDF generated from HTML content.</p>
              """;

              // Convert the HTML content to a PDF file
              var pdfFile = await HtmlToPdf.convertFromHtml(
                htmlContent,
                filename: 'example.pdf', // Specify the filename for the PDF
              );

              // Notify the user that the PDF has been saved successfully
              ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                SnackBar(content: Text('PDF saved to ${pdfFile.path}')),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Generate PDF'), // Button to trigger PDF generation
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which builds a MaterialApp.
// 2. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. The Center widget contains an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the onPressed callback is triggered.
// 5. The HTML content is defined as a string.
// 6. The HtmlToPdf.convertFromHtml method is called to convert the HTML to a PDF file.
// 7. Once the PDF is generated, a SnackBar is displayed to inform the user of the saved PDF location.
```

In summary, the `html_to_pdf` package provides a straightforward way to convert HTML content into PDF documents in Flutter applications.
