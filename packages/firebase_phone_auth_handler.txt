# Firebase Phone Auth Handler Flutter Package

The `firebase_phone_auth_handler` package is a powerful tool for implementing phone number authentication in Flutter applications using Firebase. This package simplifies the process of verifying users through their phone numbers, making it easier for developers to integrate secure authentication methods into their apps.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `firebase_phone_auth_handler` package when:
- You want to provide a seamless phone number authentication experience in your Flutter app.
- You need to ensure that users can log in or sign up using their phone numbers, which is particularly useful in regions where email-based authentication is less common.
- You want to leverage Firebase's robust authentication features, including SMS verification and user management.

## Features

- **Easy Integration**: The package provides a straightforward API for integrating phone authentication with Firebase.
- **SMS Verification**: Automatically handles the sending and verification of SMS codes.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in error handling for common authentication issues.
- **Customizable UI**: Allows developers to customize the authentication flow to match their app's design.

By using this package, developers can enhance user experience and security in their applications with minimal effort.

# Tutorial: Setting Up Firebase Phone Auth Handler

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `firebase_phone_auth_handler` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependencies

First, add the `firebase_phone_auth_handler` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  firebase_core: ^2.0.0
  firebase_auth: ^4.0.0
  firebase_phone_auth_handler: ^1.0.0
```

## Step 2: Configure Firebase

### For Android

1. Go to the Firebase Console and create a new project.
2. Add an Android app to your project and download the `google-services.json` file.
3. Place the `google-services.json` file in the `android/app` directory.
4. Modify your `android/build.gradle` file to include the Google services classpath:

```groovy
buildscript {
    dependencies {
        // Add this line
        classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.10'
    }
}
```

5. In your `android/app/build.gradle`, apply the Google services plugin:

```groovy
apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
```

### For iOS

1. In the Firebase Console, add an iOS app to your project and download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file.
2. Place the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file in the `ios/Runner` directory.
3. Open your `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode and ensure that the `Firebase` SDK is properly configured.

## Step 3: Initialize Firebase

In your `main.dart` file, initialize Firebase before running your app:

```dart
import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await Firebase.initializeApp();
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that we have set up Firebase, we can use the `firebase_phone_auth_handler` package to implement phone authentication. 

### Example Usage

You can create a simple UI to input the phone number and verify it. The package provides methods to handle the authentication process.

# Complete Example of Firebase Phone Auth Handler

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';
import 'package:firebase_phone_auth_handler/firebase_phone_auth_handler.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await Firebase.initializeApp(); // Initialize Firebase
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the main app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Firebase Phone Auth',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: PhoneAuthScreen(), // Home screen for phone authentication
    );
  }
}

class PhoneAuthScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final TextEditingController phoneController = TextEditingController(); // Controller for phone input

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Phone Authentication')),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              controller: phoneController, // Bind the controller to the text field
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Phone Number'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Start the phone authentication process
                FirebasePhoneAuthHandler().verifyPhoneNumber(
                  phoneNumber: phoneController.text,
                  verificationCompleted: (phoneAuthCredential) {
                    // Automatically sign in the user
                    print('Verification completed: $phoneAuthCredential');
                  },
                  verificationFailed: (error) {
                    // Handle verification failure
                    print('Verification failed: ${error.message}');
                  },
                  codeSent: (verificationId, resendToken) {
                    // Handle code sent
                    print('Code sent to $verificationId');
                  },
                  codeAutoRetrievalTimeout: (verificationId) {
                    // Handle timeout
                    print('Code auto-retrieval timeout: $verificationId');
                  },
                );
              },
              child: Text('Verify Phone Number'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application that implements phone number authentication using the firebase_phone_auth_handler package.
// 
// 1. **Initialization**: The app initializes Firebase in the main function before running the app.
// 2. **UI Setup**: The PhoneAuthScreen widget contains a TextField for the user to input their phone number and a button to initiate the verification process.
// 3. **Phone Verification**: When the button is pressed, the app calls the `verifyPhoneNumber` method from the FirebasePhoneAuthHandler class. This method handles the entire phone verification process.
// 4. **Callbacks**: The method takes several callbacks:
//    - `verificationCompleted`: Automatically signs in the user if verification is successful.
//    - `verificationFailed`: Handles any errors that occur during verification.
//    - `codeSent`: Called when the verification code is sent to the user's phone.
//    - `codeAutoRetrievalTimeout`: Called when the auto-retrieval of the verification code times out.
// 
// This flow allows for a smooth user experience when verifying phone numbers in a Flutter application.
