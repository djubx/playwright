# Setting Up Flutter95

## Installation

To get started with the flutter95 package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter95: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using Flutter95

To use the flutter95 package, you need to import it into your Dart files:

```dart
import 'package:flutter95/flutter95.dart';
```

You can then start using the provided widgets in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a basic app using flutter95:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter95/flutter95.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter95 Example',
      theme: flutter95Theme, // Apply the flutter95 theme
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Welcome to Flutter95')),
      body: Center(
        child: TextButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Action when button is pressed
          },
          child: Text('Click Me!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application using the flutter95 theme and demonstrates how to use a button styled in the Windows 95 fashion.

# Complete Example of Flutter95

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter95/flutter95.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutterApp()); // Start the application with the main widget
}

class RealFlutterApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter95 Example',
      theme: flutter95Theme, // Apply the flutter95 theme
      home: RealFlutterHomeScreen(), // Set the home screen
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutterHomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Welcome to Flutter95')), // App bar with title
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center, // Center the column
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('This is a retro-styled app!'), // Display a text
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Add space between widgets
            TextButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action when button is pressed
                showDialog(
                  context: context,
                  builder: (BuildContext context) {
                    return AlertDialog(
                      title: Text('Hello!'), // Dialog title
                      content: Text('You clicked the button!'), // Dialog content
                      actions: <Widget>[
                        TextButton(
                          onPressed: () {
                            Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                          },
                          child: Text('OK'), // Button to close the dialog
                        ),
                      ],
                    );
                  },
                );
              },
              child: Text('Click Me!'), // Button text
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with RealFlutterApp.
// 2. RealFlutterApp sets up the MaterialApp with the flutter95 theme.
// 3. The home screen is set to RealFlutterHomeScreen.
// 4. RealFlutterHomeScreen builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a centered column.
// 5. The column contains a text widget and a button.
// 6. When the button is clicked, a dialog appears showing a message.
// 7. The dialog has an OK button that closes it when pressed.
```
