```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gender_picker/gender_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _selectedGender;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Gender Picker Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              GenderPicker(
                onChanged: (gender) {
                  setState(() {
                    _selectedGender = gender;
                  });
                },
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              Text(_selectedGender != null
                  ? 'Selected Gender: $_selectedGender'
                  : 'No gender selected'),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The app starts by running the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget is a stateful widget that contains a GenderPicker widget.
// When the user selects a gender, the onChanged callback is called, which updates the _selectedGender variable.
// The UI is then updated to display the selected gender.
// If no gender is selected, the UI displays a message indicating that no gender has been selected.
// The app uses a Material design theme and a Scaffold widget to provide a basic layout.
```

// The app flows by first displaying the GenderPicker widget to the user.
// The user can then select a gender, which triggers the onChanged callback.
// The callback updates the _selectedGender variable, which is then used to update the UI.
// The UI is updated by calling the setState function, which triggers a rebuild of the widget tree.
// The rebuilt widget tree displays the selected gender to the user.
// If the user does not select a gender, the UI displays a message indicating that no gender has been selected.
