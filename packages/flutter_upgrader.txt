# Setting Up and Using the Flutter Upgrader Package

## Installation

To get started with `flutter_upgrader`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_upgrader: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_upgrader).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following keys to ensure proper functionality:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage

To use the `flutter_upgrader` package, you need to initialize it in your main application file. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to do this:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_upgrader/flutter_upgrader.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Upgrader Example',
      home: Upgrader(
        child: HomeScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to the Flutter Upgrader Example!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `Upgrader` widget wraps the `HomeScreen`, allowing it to check for updates automatically when the app is launched.

# Complete Example of Flutter Upgrader

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_upgrader/flutter_upgrader.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Upgrader Example',
      home: Upgrader(
        // The Upgrader widget checks for updates and displays the dialog if needed
        child: HomeScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to the Flutter Upgrader Example!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with the title 'Flutter Upgrader Example'.
// 3. The Upgrader widget is used as the home widget, which wraps the HomeScreen.
// 4. When the app is launched, Upgrader automatically checks for updates.
// 5. If an update is available, it shows a customizable dialog to the user.
// 6. The HomeScreen displays a simple welcome message to the user.
// 7. Users can interact with the app while the Upgrader handles update notifications in the background.
