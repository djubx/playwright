# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Pixel Color Image

## Installation
To use the `pixel_color_image` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  pixel_color_image: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/pixel_color_image).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you are accessing images from the user's gallery:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to extract colors from images.</string>
```

## Using the Package
To use the `pixel_color_image` package, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:
   ```dart
   import 'package:pixel_color_image/pixel_color_image.dart';
   ```

2. Load an image and extract pixel colors:
   ```dart
   // Load an image from assets or network
   final image = await PixelColorImage.loadImage('path_to_image');

   // Get the color of a specific pixel
   final color = await image.getPixelColor(x: 10, y: 10);
   ```

This is a basic overview of how to set up and use the `pixel_color_image` package in your Flutter application. For more detailed usage, refer to the official documentation.

# Complete Example of Using Pixel Color Image

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pixel_color_image/pixel_color_image.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Pixel Color Image Example',
      home: ColorExtractorScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ColorExtractorScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ColorExtractorScreenState createState() => _ColorExtractorScreenState();
}

class _ColorExtractorScreenState extends State<ColorExtractorScreen> {
  Color? pixelColor; // Variable to hold the extracted pixel color

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _extractColor(); // Call the method to extract color when the widget initializes
  }

  Future<void> _extractColor() async {
    // Load the image from assets
    final image = await PixelColorImage.loadImage('assets/sample_image.png');

    // Extract the color of the pixel at (10, 10)
    final color = await image.getPixelColor(x: 10, y: 10);

    // Update the state with the extracted color
    setState(() {
      pixelColor = color;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Pixel Color Extractor'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: pixelColor != null
            ? Container(
                width: 100,
                height: 100,
                color: pixelColor, // Display the extracted color
              )
            : CircularProgressIndicator(), // Show a loading indicator while extracting color
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (ColorExtractorScreen).
// 3. ColorExtractorScreen initializes its state and calls _extractColor() in initState.
// 4. _extractColor() loads an image and retrieves the color of the pixel at coordinates (10, 10).
// 5. Once the color is extracted, the state is updated, and the UI is rebuilt to display the color.
// 6. If the color is not yet available, a CircularProgressIndicator is shown until the color is extracted.
