# Setting Up the Package
-------------------------

To use the `simple_url_preview_v2` package, you'll need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  simple_url_preview_v2: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Platform-Specific Configurations

#### Android

No additional configurations are required for Android.

#### iOS

You'll need to add the following lines to your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
  <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
  <true/>
</dict>
```

This allows the package to make HTTP requests to arbitrary URLs.

### Using the Package

To generate a URL preview, simply call the `SimpleUrlPreview` widget and pass in the URL you want to preview:

```dart
SimpleUrlPreview(
  url: 'https://www.example.com',

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simple_url_preview_v2/simple_url_preview_v2.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Real Flutter',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Real Flutter'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: SimpleUrlPreview(
            url: 'https://www.example.com',
            // Customize the preview layout
            titleStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            descriptionStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 18),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a screen containing a URL preview.
// 2. The URL preview is generated by the SimpleUrlPreview widget, which makes an HTTP request to the specified URL.
// 3. The HTTP request returns the HTML content of the web page, which is then parsed by the SimpleUrlPreview widget.
// 4. The parsed HTML content is used to generate a preview of the web page, complete with title, description, and image.
// 5. The preview is then displayed to the user on the screen.

// In summary, the code flows as follows:
// 1. runApp(RealFlutter()) -> 2. RealFlutter.build() -> 3. SimpleUrlPreview() -> 4. HTTP request -> 5. Parse HTML content -> 6. Generate preview -> 7. Display preview to user.
