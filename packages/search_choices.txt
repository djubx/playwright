<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Search Choices Flutter Package

The **search_choices** Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to enhance the user experience by providing a customizable dropdown selection interface. It allows users to search through a list of options, making it easier to find and select items, especially when dealing with large datasets. This package is particularly useful in forms, settings, and any scenario where users need to make selections from a long list.

## When to Use This Package
- **Forms with Large Datasets**: When you have a large number of options, a standard dropdown can become unwieldy. The search functionality allows users to quickly filter through options.
- **Dynamic Data**: If your options are fetched from an API or database, this package can help users find relevant choices without scrolling through long lists.
- **User Preferences**: In applications where users frequently change settings or preferences, providing a search option can enhance usability.

## Features
- **Searchable Dropdown**: Users can type to filter options, making it easier to find specific items.
- **Customizable UI**: The appearance of the dropdown can be tailored to fit the design of your application.
- **Multiple Selection**: Supports selecting multiple items, which is useful for tagging or categorizing.
- **Integration with Form Validation**: Works seamlessly with Flutter's form validation system.

Overall, the **search_choices** package is an excellent choice for any Flutter application that requires a user-friendly selection interface.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Search Choices Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the **search_choices** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  search_choices: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:search_choices/search_choices.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage
You can use the `SearchChoices` widget to create a searchable dropdown. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
SearchChoices.single(
  items: [
    DropdownMenuItem(value: 1, child: Text("Option 1")),
    DropdownMenuItem(value: 2, child: Text("Option 2")),
    DropdownMenuItem(value: 3, child: Text("Option 3")),
  ],
  value: selectedValue,
  hint: "Select an option",
  searchHint: "Search option",
  onChanged: (value) {
    setState(() {
      selectedValue = value;
    });
  },
  isExpanded: true,
);
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` if your app requires internet access to fetch data for the dropdown.

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Customization
You can customize the appearance of the dropdown by using various properties such as `icon`, `style`, and `decoration`. For example:

```dart
SearchChoices.single(
  items: [...],
  icon: Icon(Icons.arrow_drop_down),
  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.black),
  decoration: InputDecoration(
    border: OutlineInputBorder(),
    labelText: "Choose an option",
  ),
);
```

With these steps, you can effectively integrate the **search_choices** package into your Flutter application, providing a better user experience for selecting options.

# Complete Example of Using Search Choices

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:search_choices/search_choices.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Search Choices Example',
      home: SearchChoicesDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class SearchChoicesDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SearchChoicesDemoState createState() => _SearchChoicesDemoState();
}

class _SearchChoicesDemoState extends State<SearchChoicesDemo> {
  // Variable to hold the selected value
  int? selectedValue;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Search Choices Demo'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            // SearchChoices widget for selecting a single option
            SearchChoices.single(
              items: [
                DropdownMenuItem(value: 1, child: Text("Option 1")),
                DropdownMenuItem(value: 2, child: Text("Option 2")),
                DropdownMenuItem(value: 3, child: Text("Option 3")),
              ],
              value: selectedValue,
              hint: "Select an option",
              searchHint: "Search option",
              onChanged: (value) {
                setState(() {
                  selectedValue = value; // Update the selected value
                });
              },
              isExpanded: true,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Display the selected value
            Text(
              selectedValue != null
                  ? "Selected Value: $selectedValue"
                  : "No option selected",
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The SearchChoicesDemo widget is created, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 3. Inside the _SearchChoicesDemoState, a variable 'selectedValue' is defined to hold the user's selection.
// 4. The build method constructs the UI, including an AppBar and a SearchChoices widget.
// 5. The SearchChoices widget displays a dropdown with options. When an option is selected, the onChanged callback updates the 'selectedValue'.
// 6. The selected value is displayed below the dropdown, updating dynamically as the user makes a selection.
```
