# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using fl_animated_linechart

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `fl_animated_linechart` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  fl_animated_linechart: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the chart, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:fl_animated_linechart/fl_animated_linechart.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Animated Line Chart

You can now use the `AnimatedLineChart` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
AnimatedLineChart(
  data: [
    LineChartData(
      points: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
      color: Colors.blue,
    ),
    LineChartData(
      points: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1],
      color: Colors.red,
    ),
  ],
  duration: Duration(seconds: 1),
)
```

This code snippet creates a line chart with two lines, one blue and one red, with a duration of one second for the animation.

## Conclusion

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the `fl_animated_linechart` package in your Flutter application. The package is straightforward to integrate and provides a rich set of features for creating animated line charts.

# Complete Example of fl_animated_linechart

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fl_animated_linechart/fl_animated_linechart.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animated Line Chart Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Animated Line Chart'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: AnimatedLineChart(
            // Define the data for the line chart
            data: [
              LineChartData(
                // First line data points
                points: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
                color: Colors.blue,
              ),
              LineChartData(
                // Second line data points
                points: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1],
                color: Colors.red,
              ),
            ],
            // Set the duration for the animation
            duration: Duration(seconds: 1),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, the AnimatedLineChart is created with two lines of data.
// 5. Each line is defined by its data points and color.
// 6. The chart animates over a duration of one second when the data changes.
