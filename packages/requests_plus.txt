# Setting Up and Using the requests_plus Package
=============================================

### Adding the Package to Your Project

To add the `requests_plus` package to your project, add the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

  requests_plus: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Importing the Package

```

### Making a Request

Request request = Request('https://example.com');
Response response = await request.send();
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

On Android, you need to add the following line to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file to allow the app to access the internet:

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

#### iOS

On iOS, you need to add the following line to your `Info.plist` file to allow the app to access the internet:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'requests_plus Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  String _response = '';

  // Step 1: Create a new instance of the Request class
  Request _request = Request('https://example.com');

  // Step 2: Set the request method to GET
  void _sendGetRequest() async {
    _request.method = RequestMethod.GET;
    Response response = await _request.send();
    setState(() {
      _response = response.body;
    });
  }

  // Step 3: Set the request method to POST and add some data
  void _sendPostRequest() async {
    _request.method = RequestMethod.POST;
    _request.data = {'key': 'value'};
    Response response = await _request.send();
    setState(() {
      _response = response.body;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('requests_plus Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(_response),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _sendGetRequest,
              child: Text('Send GET Request'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 10),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _sendPostRequest,
              child: Text('Send POST Request'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user opens the app and is presented with a screen containing two buttons.
// 2. When the user clicks the "Send GET Request" button, the _sendGetRequest function is called.
// 3. This function creates a new instance of the Request class and sets the request method to GET.
// 4. The request is then sent and the response is stored in the _response variable.
// 5. The UI is updated to display the response.
// 6. When the user clicks the "Send POST Request" button, the _sendPostRequest function is called.
// 7. This function creates a new instance of the Request class and sets the request method to POST.
// 8. Some data is added to the request and it is sent.
// 9. The response is stored in the _response variable and the UI is updated to display it.

// This example demonstrates how to use the requests_plus package to send GET and POST requests.
// It also shows how to handle the responses and update the UI accordingly.
