# Overview of the "tron" Flutter Package

The "tron" package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who want to integrate Tron blockchain functionalities into their applications. It provides a seamless way to interact with the Tron network, allowing developers to create decentralized applications (dApps) that can send and receive TRX (Tron’s native cryptocurrency), manage wallets, and interact with smart contracts.

## When to Use "tron"

You should consider using the "tron" package when:
- You are developing a dApp that requires interaction with the Tron blockchain.
- You need to manage TRX transactions within your Flutter application.
- You want to create a wallet application for Tron users.

## Key Features
- **Wallet Management**: Create and manage Tron wallets directly from your Flutter app.
- **Transaction Handling**: Send and receive TRX with ease.
- **Smart Contract Interaction**: Call and interact with smart contracts deployed on the Tron network.
- **Event Listening**: Listen for events on the Tron blockchain, such as transaction confirmations.

# Setting Up the "tron" Package

To get started with the "tron" package, follow these steps:

## Installation

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the "tron" package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     tron: ^latest_version
   ```

   Replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

2. **Install Packages**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
- Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS
- For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file, especially if you are accessing the internet or using device features.

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

## Basic Usage

Once the package is installed and configured, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Here’s a simple example of how to create a wallet and send TRX.

# Complete Example of Using the "tron" Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tron/tron.dart'; // Import the tron package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the main application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late Tron tron; // Declare a Tron instance
  String walletAddress = ''; // Variable to hold the wallet address
  String transactionStatus = ''; // Variable to hold transaction status

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    tron = Tron(); // Initialize the Tron instance
    createWallet(); // Call the function to create a wallet
  }

  // Function to create a new wallet
  void createWallet() {
    final wallet = tron.createWallet(); // Create a new wallet
    setState(() {
      walletAddress = wallet.address; // Set the wallet address
    });
  }

  // Function to send TRX
  void sendTRX() async {
    try {
      final result = await tron.sendTRX(walletAddress, 'recipient_address', 1); // Send 1 TRX
      setState(() {
        transactionStatus = 'Transaction successful: $result'; // Update transaction status
      });
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        transactionStatus = 'Transaction failed: $e'; // Handle transaction failure
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Tron Flutter Example')), // App bar title
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              Text('Wallet Address: $walletAddress'), // Display wallet address
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: sendTRX, // Button to send TRX
                child: Text('Send 1 TRX'), // Button label
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              Text(transactionStatus), // Display transaction status
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The application starts by running the `RealFlutter` widget.
// In the `initState` method, we initialize the Tron instance and create a new wallet.
// The wallet address is displayed on the screen.
// When the user presses the "Send 1 TRX" button, the `sendTRX` function is called.
// This function attempts to send 1 TRX to a specified recipient address.
// The transaction status is updated based on whether the transaction was successful or failed.
// The UI updates automatically to reflect the current wallet address and transaction status.
