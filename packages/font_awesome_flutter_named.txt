            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Add a Font Awesome icon

                color: Colors.red,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Add a button with a Font Awesome icon
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {},
                child: Row(
                  children: <Widget>[
                    FaIcon(
                      FontAwesomeIconsNamed.download,
                      size: 24,
                      color: Colors.white,
                    ),
                    SizedBox(width: 10),
                    Text('Download'),
                  ],
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app.
// 2. The app displays a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 3. The body contains a Column with two children: a Font Awesome icon and a button.
// 4. The Font Awesome icon is displayed using the FaIcon widget.
// 5. The button is displayed using the ElevatedButton widget and contains a Row with a Font Awesome icon and a Text widget.
// 6. When the user presses the button, the onPressed callback is called.
