<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Azure Speech Recognition Null Safety Flutter Package

The `azure_speech_recognition_null_safety` package is a Flutter plugin that provides a seamless interface for integrating Azure's Speech Recognition capabilities into Flutter applications. This package is designed with null safety in mind, ensuring that developers can build robust applications without the common pitfalls associated with null references.

## When to Use This Package

This package is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to implement voice recognition features in your Flutter app. Some common use cases include:

- **Voice Commands**: Enabling users to control app functionalities using voice commands.
- **Transcription Services**: Converting spoken language into text for applications like note-taking or transcription services.
- **Accessibility Features**: Enhancing app accessibility by allowing users to interact with the app using their voice.

## Features

- **Real-time Speech Recognition**: Capture and transcribe speech in real-time.
- **Multi-language Support**: Supports various languages, making it suitable for global applications.
- **Customizable**: Allows developers to customize the recognition process according to their needs.
- **Null Safety**: Built with Dart's null safety features, reducing runtime errors related to null references.

With these features, the `azure_speech_recognition_null_safety` package is a powerful tool for developers looking to enhance their Flutter applications with voice recognition capabilities.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Azure Speech Recognition Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `azure_speech_recognition_null_safety` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  azure_speech_recognition_null_safety: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open `AndroidManifest.xml` located in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

2. **Minimum SDK Version**: Ensure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open `Info.plist` located in `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following entries:

   ```xml
   <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your microphone for speech recognition.</string>
   <key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need Bluetooth access for better audio quality.</string>
   ```

2. **Deployment Target**: Ensure your deployment target is set to at least iOS 11.0 in `ios/Podfile`:

   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '11.0'
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have configured the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. Below is a complete example demonstrating how to implement speech recognition.

# Complete Example: Implementing Azure Speech Recognition

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:azure_speech_recognition_null_safety/azure_speech_recognition_null_safety.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _recognizedText = "Press the button and start speaking!";
  bool _isListening = false;

  // Initialize the speech recognizer
  final SpeechRecognition _speechRecognition = SpeechRecognition();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the speech recognizer
    _speechRecognition.setRecognitionResultHandler((String text) {
      setState(() {
        _recognizedText = text; // Update the recognized text
      });
    });
  }

  // Start listening for speech
  void _startListening() async {
    setState(() {
      _isListening = true; // Update listening state
    });
    await _speechRecognition.startListening(); // Start listening
  }

  // Stop listening for speech
  void _stopListening() async {
    await _speechRecognition.stopListening(); // Stop listening
    setState(() {
      _isListening = false; // Update listening state
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Azure Speech Recognition Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text(
                _recognizedText, // Display recognized text
                textAlign: TextAlign.center,
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _isListening ? _stopListening : _startListening,
                child: Text(_isListening ? 'Stop Listening' : 'Start Listening'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation

// The application starts by running the `RealFlutter` widget.
// In the `initState` method, we set up the speech recognizer and define a handler for the recognition results.
// The `_startListening` method is called when the user presses the "Start Listening" button.
// This method updates the `_isListening` state to true and starts the speech recognition process.
// The recognized text is updated in the `_recognizedText` variable, which is displayed on the screen.
// When the user presses the "Stop Listening" button, the `_stopListening` method is called,
// which stops the speech recognition and updates the `_isListening` state to false.
// The UI updates accordingly to reflect the current state of the application.
