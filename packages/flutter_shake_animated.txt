# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_shake_animated

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `flutter_shake_animated` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_shake_animated: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_shake_animated/flutter_shake_animated.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Shake Animation

You can use the `ShakeAnimatedWidget` to wrap any widget you want to animate. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to implement it:

```dart
ShakeAnimatedWidget(
  enabled: true, // Set to true to enable shaking
  duration: Duration(milliseconds: 500), // Duration of the shake
  shakeAnimation: CurvedAnimation(
    parent: AnimationController(
      vsync: this,
      duration: Duration(milliseconds: 500),
    ),
    curve: Curves.easeInOut,
  ),
  child: YourWidget(), // Replace with your widget
)
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Testing the Animation

Once you have set up the package, run your application on an emulator or a physical device to see the shake animation in action. You can toggle the `enabled` property to control when the animation should occur.

With these steps, you should be able to successfully integrate the `flutter_shake_animated` package into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of flutter_shake_animated

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_shake_animated/flutter_shake_animated.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Shake Animated Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Shake Animation Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ShakeAnimatedWidget(
            enabled: true, // Enable the shake animation
            duration: Duration(milliseconds: 500), // Duration of the shake
            shakeAnimation: CurvedAnimation(
              parent: AnimationController(
                vsync: this,
                duration: Duration(milliseconds: 500),
              ),
              curve: Curves.easeInOut,
            ),
            child: ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action when button is pressed
              },
              child: Text('Shake Me!'),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'Shake Animation Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 5. The ShakeAnimatedWidget wraps an ElevatedButton, enabling the shake animation.
// 6. When the button is pressed, it can trigger an action (currently empty).
// 7. The shake animation is enabled, and the button will shake for 500 milliseconds when the animation is triggered.
