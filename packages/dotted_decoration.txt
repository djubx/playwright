# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Dotted Decoration

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **dotted_decoration** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dotted_decoration: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # Ensure this is set to at least 10.0
```

## Step 4: Using Dotted Decoration

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter widgets. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to apply dotted decoration to a container:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dotted_decoration/dotted_decoration.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Dotted Decoration Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Container(
          width: 200,
          height: 200,
          decoration: DottedDecoration(
            color: Colors.blue,
            strokeWidth: 2,
            dash: [5, 5], // Length of the dash and gap
          ),
          child: Center(child: Text('Hello, Dots!')),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code creates a centered container with a dotted border. You can customize the `color`, `strokeWidth`, and `dash` properties to achieve the desired look.

# Complete Example of Dotted Decoration

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dotted_decoration/dotted_decoration.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dotted Decoration Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Dotted Decoration Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Container(
          width: 200, // Set the width of the container
          height: 200, // Set the height of the container
          decoration: DottedDecoration(
            color: Colors.blue, // Color of the dots
            strokeWidth: 2, // Thickness of the dots
            dash: [5, 5], // Length of the dash and gap
          ),
          child: Center(
            child: Text(
              'Hello, Dots!', // Text inside the container
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20), // Style for the text
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a centered Container.
// 4. The Container has a width and height of 200 pixels and uses DottedDecoration for its decoration.
// 5. The DottedDecoration is configured with a blue color, a stroke width of 2, and a dash pattern of [5, 5].
// 6. Inside the Container, there is a centered Text widget displaying "Hello, Dots!" with a font size of 20.
// 7. The app displays a simple UI with a dotted border around the text, demonstrating the use of the dotted_decoration package.
