# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the momo_vn Package

## Installation
To get started with the `momo_vn` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  momo_vn: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/momo_vn).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure you have the following configurations:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:
   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. Ensure you have the correct deployment target set in your `ios/Podfile`:
   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

## Using the Package
Once you have installed and configured the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to initiate a payment.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:momo_vn/momo_vn.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('MoMo Payment Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Initialize MoMo payment
              MoMoVn.startPayment(
                amount: 10000, // Amount in VND
                orderId: 'order123',
                orderInfo: 'Payment for order 123',
                redirectUrl: 'https://your_redirect_url.com',
                extraData: 'Extra data if needed',
              ).then((result) {
                // Handle payment result
                if (result['status'] == 'success') {
                  // Payment was successful
                  print('Payment successful: ${result['message']}');
                } else {
                  // Payment failed
                  print('Payment failed: ${result['message']}');
                }
              });
            },
            child: Text('Pay with MoMo'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app with a button that initiates a payment when pressed. The `MoMoVn.startPayment` method is called with necessary parameters like amount, order ID, and redirect URL.

# Complete Example of Using the momo_vn Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:momo_vn/momo_vn.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('MoMo Payment Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Start the MoMo payment process
              MoMoVn.startPayment(
                amount: 10000, // Amount in VND
                orderId: 'order123', // Unique order ID
                orderInfo: 'Payment for order 123', // Description of the order
                redirectUrl: 'https://your_redirect_url.com', // URL to redirect after payment
                extraData: 'Extra data if needed', // Any additional data
              ).then((result) {
                // Handle the result of the payment
                if (result['status'] == 'success') {
                  // If payment is successful, print the success message
                  print('Payment successful: ${result['message']}');
                } else {
                  // If payment fails, print the failure message
                  print('Payment failed: ${result['message']}');
                }
              });
            },
            child: Text('Pay with MoMo'), // Button text
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the app
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation
// The application starts by running the `RealFlutter` widget.
// It displays a simple UI with an AppBar and a centered button.
// When the button is pressed, it triggers the `MoMoVn.startPayment` method.
// This method initiates the payment process with the specified parameters.
// After the payment process, it returns a result which is handled in the `then` callback.
// If the payment is successful, a success message is printed to the console.
// If the payment fails, a failure message is printed instead.
// This flow allows users to make payments easily using the MoMo payment gateway.
