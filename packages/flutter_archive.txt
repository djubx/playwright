# Flutter Archive Package: A Comprehensive Overview

The `flutter_archive` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that simplifies the process of working with ZIP files. It allows you to create, read, and extract ZIP archives directly within your Flutter applications. This package is particularly useful when you need to handle file compression and decompression, such as when downloading multiple files, packaging assets, or managing backups.

## When to Use `flutter_archive`

- **File Management**: When your application needs to manage multiple files, such as images or documents, and you want to compress them for storage or transmission.
- **Data Backup**: If your app requires backing up user data, you can easily create a ZIP file containing all necessary files.
- **Asset Packaging**: When you want to package assets for distribution or download, using ZIP files can simplify the process.

## Features

- **Create ZIP Files**: Easily create ZIP archives from a list of files or directories.
- **Extract ZIP Files**: Decompress ZIP files to a specified directory.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Simple API**: The package provides a straightforward API that makes it easy to integrate into your Flutter applications.

With these features, `flutter_archive` is an essential package for any Flutter developer looking to manage file archives efficiently.

# Setting Up and Using the `flutter_archive` Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `flutter_archive` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_archive: ^5.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you are accessing files from the device storage. Add the following keys:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save images.</string>
<key>NSDocumentsFolderUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your documents folder to manage files.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to create and extract ZIP files.

```dart
import 'dart:io';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_archive/flutter_archive.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Archive Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Archive Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Create a ZIP file
              final directory = Directory.systemTemp;
              final zipFile = File('${directory.path}/example.zip');

              // Create a list of files to add to the ZIP
              final filesToZip = [
                File('${directory.path}/file1.txt'),
                File('${directory.path}/file2.txt'),
              ];

              // Create the ZIP file
              final zipFileStream = zipFile.openWrite();
              final archive = Archive();

              for (var file in filesToZip) {
                final bytes = await file.readAsBytes();
                archive.addFile(ArchiveFile(file.path.split('/').last, bytes.length, bytes));
              }

              // Write the archive to the ZIP file
              ZipFileEncoder().zipDirectory(directory, destination: zipFile);

              // Extract the ZIP file
              final extractedDir = Directory('${directory.path}/extracted');
              await extractedDir.create();
              await ZipFileDecoder().decode(zipFile, destination: extractedDir);
            },
            child: Text('Create and Extract ZIP'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Using `flutter_archive`

```dart
import 'dart:io';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_archive/flutter_archive.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Archive Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Archive Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Step 1: Define the temporary directory to store files
              final directory = Directory.systemTemp;
              // Step 2: Create a ZIP file in the temporary directory
              final zipFile = File('${directory.path}/example.zip');

              // Step 3: Create a list of files to add to the ZIP
              final filesToZip = [
                File('${directory.path}/file1.txt'),
                File('${directory.path}/file2.txt'),
              ];

              // Step 4: Create the ZIP file
              final zipFileStream = zipFile.openWrite();
              final archive = Archive();

              // Step 5: Add each file to the archive
              for (var file in filesToZip) {
                final bytes = await file.readAsBytes();
                archive.addFile(ArchiveFile(file.path.split('/').last, bytes.length, bytes));
              }

              // Step 6: Write the archive to the ZIP file
              ZipFileEncoder().zipDirectory(directory, destination: zipFile);

              // Step 7: Create a directory to extract the ZIP file
              final extractedDir = Directory('${directory.path}/extracted');
              await extractedDir.create();
              // Step 8: Extract the ZIP file to the specified directory
              await ZipFileDecoder().decode(zipFile, destination: extractedDir);
            },
            child: Text('Create and Extract ZIP'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with a MaterialApp containing a button.
// 2. When the button is pressed, it defines a temporary directory to store files.
// 3. It creates a ZIP file named 'example.zip' in the temporary directory.
// 4. A list of files to be zipped is defined.
// 5. Each file is read as bytes and added to the archive.
// 6. The archive is then written to the ZIP file.
// 7. A new directory named 'extracted' is created to hold the extracted files.
// 8. Finally, the ZIP file is extracted into the 'extracted' directory.
```
