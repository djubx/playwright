# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Pure_FTP Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the pure_ftp package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  pure_ftp: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to connect to an FTP server, upload a file, and download a file.

```dart
import 'package:pure_ftp/pure_ftp.dart';

class RealFlutter {
  final String host = 'ftp.example.com';
  final String username = 'your_username';
  final String password = 'your_password';

  Future<void> connectAndTransfer() async {
    // Create an FTP client instance
    final ftpClient = FtpClient(host, username: username, password: password);

    try {
      // Connect to the FTP server
      await ftpClient.connect();
      print('Connected to FTP server');

      // Upload a file
      await ftpClient.uploadFile(File('path/to/local/file.txt'), 'remote/file.txt');
      print('File uploaded successfully');

      // Download a file
      await ftpClient.downloadFile('remote/file.txt', File('path/to/local/downloaded_file.txt'));
      print('File downloaded successfully');
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error: $e');
    } finally {
      // Disconnect from the server
      await ftpClient.disconnect();
      print('Disconnected from FTP server');
    }
  }
}
```

This code demonstrates how to connect to an FTP server, upload a file, and download a file using the pure_ftp package.

# Complete Example of Using Pure_FTP

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pure_ftp/pure_ftp.dart';
import 'dart:io';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Pure FTP Example',
      home: FTPHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class FTPHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _FTPHomePageState createState() => _FTPHomePageState();
}

class _FTPHomePageState extends State<FTPHomePage> {
  final String host = 'ftp.example.com'; // FTP server address
  final String username = 'your_username'; // FTP username
  final String password = 'your_password'; // FTP password

  // Method to connect to the FTP server and perform file operations
  Future<void> connectAndTransfer() async {
    final ftpClient = FtpClient(host, username: username, password: password);

    try {
      await ftpClient.connect(); // Connect to the FTP server
      print('Connected to FTP server');

      // Upload a file
      await ftpClient.uploadFile(File('path/to/local/file.txt'), 'remote/file.txt');
      print('File uploaded successfully');

      // Download a file
      await ftpClient.downloadFile('remote/file.txt', File('path/to/local/downloaded_file.txt'));
      print('File downloaded successfully');
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error: $e'); // Handle any errors that occur during the process
    } finally {
      await ftpClient.disconnect(); // Ensure the client is disconnected
      print('Disconnected from FTP server');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Pure FTP Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: connectAndTransfer, // Trigger the FTP operations on button press
          child: Text('Connect and Transfer Files'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and displays a button on the home page.
// 2. When the button is pressed, the connectAndTransfer method is called.
// 3. This method creates an instance of FtpClient with the provided host, username, and password.
// 4. It attempts to connect to the FTP server.
// 5. Upon successful connection, it uploads a specified file to the server.
// 6. After uploading, it downloads a file from the server to a local path.
// 7. If any errors occur during the process, they are caught and printed.
// 8. Finally, the connection to the FTP server is closed, ensuring proper resource management.
