# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Ticket Material Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **ticket_material** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ticket_material: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # Ensure this is set to at least 10.0
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that the package is set up, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to create a ticket using the **ticket_material** package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ticket_material/ticket_material.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Ticket Material Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Ticket Material Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: TicketWidget(
            title: 'Concert Ticket',
            subtitle: 'Live Music Event',
            date: '2024-09-30',
            status: TicketStatus.available,
            onTap: () {
              // Handle ticket tap
              print('Ticket tapped!');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple app that displays a concert ticket. The `TicketWidget` is customizable and responds to user interactions.

## Step 4: Customization and Optimization

You can customize the `TicketWidget` by modifying its properties such as `title`, `subtitle`, `date`, and `status`. Additionally, consider optimizing your app by using Flutter's performance profiling tools to ensure smooth animations and transitions.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the **ticket_material** package into your Flutter application effectively.

# Complete Example of Using the Ticket Material Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ticket_material/ticket_material.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Ticket Material Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Ticket Material Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: TicketWidget(
            title: 'Concert Ticket', // Title of the ticket
            subtitle: 'Live Music Event', // Subtitle providing more details
            date: '2024-09-30', // Date of the event
            status: TicketStatus.available, // Current status of the ticket
            onTap: () {
              // Handle ticket tap
              print('Ticket tapped!'); // Action when the ticket is tapped
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Entry point of the application
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which calls runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Ticket Material Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers a TicketWidget.
// 5. The TicketWidget displays a concert ticket with a title, subtitle, date, and status.
// 6. When the ticket is tapped, it triggers the onTap callback, printing "Ticket tapped!" to the console.
