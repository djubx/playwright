# Overview of the platform_device_id_v2 Flutter Package

The `platform_device_id_v2` package is a Flutter plugin that provides a unique identifier for the device on which the application is running. This identifier can be useful for various purposes, such as analytics, user tracking, and managing user sessions. The package is designed to work seamlessly across both Android and iOS platforms, ensuring that developers can retrieve device IDs without worrying about platform-specific implementations.

## When to Use This Package
- **User Analytics**: Track user behavior across sessions by associating actions with a unique device ID.
- **User Authentication**: Implement device-based authentication mechanisms.
- **Session Management**: Maintain user sessions by identifying devices uniquely.

## Key Features
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS.
- **Simple API**: Easy to use with minimal setup.
- **Unique Device ID**: Provides a unique identifier that remains consistent across app launches.

Overall, `platform_device_id_v2` is a valuable tool for developers looking to implement device identification in their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using platform_device_id_v2

## Installation
To use the `platform_device_id_v2` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  platform_device_id_v2: ^2.0.0
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following key to request permission for accessing device information:
   ```xml
   <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
   <string>This app requires access to the photo library.</string>
   ```

## Using the Package
To use the package, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:platform_device_id_v2/platform_device_id_v2.dart';
```

You can then retrieve the device ID as follows:

```dart
void getDeviceId() async {
  String deviceId = await PlatformDeviceId.getDeviceId;
  print("Device ID: $deviceId");
}
```

This function retrieves the unique device ID and prints it to the console. You can call this function in your app's initialization logic or wherever you need the device ID.

# Complete Example of platform_device_id_v2

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:platform_device_id_v2/platform_device_id_v2.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Device ID Example',
      home: DeviceIdScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class DeviceIdScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DeviceIdScreenState createState() => _DeviceIdScreenState();
}

class _DeviceIdScreenState extends State<DeviceIdScreen> {
  String _deviceId = "Unknown";

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _getDeviceId(); // Call the method to get the device ID when the widget initializes
  }

  // Method to retrieve the device ID
  void _getDeviceId() async {
    String deviceId = await PlatformDeviceId.getDeviceId; // Fetch the device ID
    setState(() {
      _deviceId = deviceId; // Update the state with the retrieved device ID
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Device ID Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Device ID: $_deviceId'), // Display the device ID on the screen
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (DeviceIdScreen).
// 3. DeviceIdScreen is a stateful widget that initializes its state in initState.
// 4. In initState, the _getDeviceId method is called to fetch the device ID asynchronously.
// 5. The _getDeviceId method uses the PlatformDeviceId.getDeviceId method to retrieve the device ID.
// 6. Once the device ID is fetched, the state is updated using setState, which triggers a rebuild.
// 7. The build method displays the device ID in the center of the screen.
