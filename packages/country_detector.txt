# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Country Detector Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the **country_detector** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  country_detector: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions to access the internet, as the package may need to fetch data from online services:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `Info.plist` to allow network requests:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:country_detector/country_detector.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: CountryDetectorScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class CountryDetectorScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CountryDetectorScreenState createState() => _CountryDetectorScreenState();
}

class _CountryDetectorScreenState extends State<CountryDetectorScreen> {
  String _country = 'Unknown';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _detectCountry();
  }

  Future<void> _detectCountry() async {
    String country = await CountryDetector.getCountry();
    setState(() {
      _country = country;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Country Detector')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Detected Country: $_country'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that detects and displays the user's country.

# Complete Example of Country Detector

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:country_detector/country_detector.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: CountryDetectorScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class CountryDetectorScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CountryDetectorScreenState createState() => _CountryDetectorScreenState();
}

class _CountryDetectorScreenState extends State<CountryDetectorScreen> {
  String _country = 'Unknown'; // Variable to hold the detected country

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _detectCountry(); // Call the method to detect the country when the widget initializes
  }

  Future<void> _detectCountry() async {
    // Asynchronously get the country using the CountryDetector package
    String country = await CountryDetector.getCountry();
    setState(() {
      _country = country; // Update the state with the detected country
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Country Detector')), // App bar with title
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Detected Country: $_country'), // Display the detected country
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The CountryDetectorScreen widget is displayed as the home screen.
// 3. In the _CountryDetectorScreenState class, the initState method is called when the widget is created.
// 4. The _detectCountry method is called to fetch the user's country asynchronously.
// 5. Once the country is detected, the state is updated, and the UI reflects the detected country.
// 6. The detected country is displayed in the center of the screen.
```

In summary, the **country_detector** package provides a straightforward way to detect the user's country in a Flutter application. By following the setup and usage instructions, developers can easily integrate this functionality into their apps, enhancing user experience through localization and personalized content.
