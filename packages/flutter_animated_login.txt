# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_animated_login

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_animated_login` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_animated_login` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_animated_login: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple login screen using `flutter_animated_login`. Below is a basic example of how to implement it.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_animated_login/flutter_animated_login.dart';
```

2. Create a new widget that uses the `RealFlutter` class to build the login screen.

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: Center(
        child: AnimatedLogin(
          title: 'Login',
          onLogin: (username, password) {
            // Handle login logic here
            print('Username: $username, Password: $password');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Finally, run your application to see the animated login screen in action.

This setup provides a basic animated login screen. You can further customize the animations and styles as per your requirements.

# Complete Example of flutter_animated_login

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_animated_login/flutter_animated_login.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Animated Login Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(), // Set the home to our RealFlutter widget
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Animated Login'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: AnimatedLogin(
          title: 'Login',
          onLogin: (username, password) {
            // Handle login logic here
            print('Username: $username, Password: $password');
            // You can add your authentication logic here
          },
          // Optional: Customize the appearance
          titleStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
          buttonStyle: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
            primary: Colors.blue,
            onPrimary: Colors.white,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme, and specifies RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a centered AnimatedLogin widget.
// 4. The AnimatedLogin widget displays a title and handles login through the onLogin callback.
// 5. When the user submits their credentials, the onLogin callback is triggered, allowing you to handle authentication logic.
```
