# JioSaavn Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

To get started with the **jiosaavn** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  jiosaavn: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/jiosaavn).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the package, you can start by importing it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:jiosaavn/jiosaavn.dart';
```

You can then create an instance of the main class, `RealFlutter`, and utilize its methods to interact with the JioSaavn API.

```dart
void main() {
  RealFlutter realFlutter = RealFlutter();
  // Example usage of the package methods will go here
}
```

This setup will allow you to access the various functionalities provided by the JioSaavn package, such as searching for songs and controlling playback.

# Complete Example of JioSaavn Flutter Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:jiosaavn/jiosaavn.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'JioSaavn Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  List<Song> songs = []; // List to hold the songs
  bool isLoading = true; // Loading state

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    fetchSongs(); // Fetch songs when the widget is initialized
  }

  // Function to fetch songs from JioSaavn
  Future<void> fetchSongs() async {
    try {
      // Using the JioSaavn API to search for songs
      var result = await JioSaavn.search('Bollywood');
      setState(() {
        songs = result; // Update the songs list with the fetched songs
        isLoading = false; // Set loading to false
      });
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error fetching songs: $e'); // Handle any errors
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('JioSaavn Music'),
      ),
      body: isLoading
          ? Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator()) // Show loading indicator
          : ListView.builder(
              itemCount: songs.length, // Number of songs
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text(songs[index].title), // Display song title
                  subtitle: Text(songs[index].artist), // Display artist name
                  onTap: () {
                    // Handle song tap
                    // Here you can add functionality to play the song
                  },
                );
              },
            ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the `main` function, which runs the `MyApp` widget.
// 2. `MyApp` sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home as `RealFlutter`.
// 3. In `RealFlutter`, the state is managed using `_RealFlutterState`.
// 4. On initialization, `fetchSongs` is called to retrieve songs from JioSaavn.
// 5. The songs are fetched asynchronously, and the UI updates once the data is available.
// 6. If loading, a CircularProgressIndicator is shown; otherwise, a ListView displays the songs.
// 7. Each song is displayed as a ListTile, and tapping on it can trigger playback functionality.
