# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Overlay Support

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `overlay_support` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  overlay_support: ^1.2.1  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Basic Setup

In your main application file, you need to wrap your app with the `OverlaySupport` widget. This widget provides the necessary context for displaying overlays.

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the correct permissions and configurations. Typically, no special permissions are required for overlays, but ensure your app's theme supports overlays.

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to adjust your app's Info.plist file to allow for overlays. However, the default settings usually suffice.

## Step 3: Using Overlay Support

You can now use the package to display overlays. Hereâ€™s how to show a simple notification:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:overlay_support/overlay_support.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return OverlaySupport.global( // Wrap your app with OverlaySupport
      child: MaterialApp(
        title: 'Overlay Support Example',
        home: HomeScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Overlay Support Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Show a simple notification
            showSimpleNotification(
              Text("Hello, this is a notification!"),
              background: Colors.green,
            );
          },
          child: Text('Show Notification'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, a notification appears at the top of the screen. You can customize the notification's appearance and behavior as needed.

## Conclusion

The `overlay_support` package is a versatile tool for enhancing user interaction in Flutter applications. By following the steps outlined above, you can easily integrate and utilize overlays in your app, providing a better user experience.

# Complete Example of Overlay Support

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:overlay_support/overlay_support.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// Main application widget
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return OverlaySupport.global( // Wrap the app with OverlaySupport
      child: MaterialApp(
        title: 'Overlay Support Example',
        home: HomeScreen(), // Set the home screen
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Home screen widget
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Overlay Support Example')), // App bar title
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Show a simple notification when the button is pressed
            showSimpleNotification(
              Text("Hello, this is a notification!"), // Notification message
              background: Colors.green, // Background color of the notification
            );
          },
          child: Text('Show Notification'), // Button text
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that wraps the MaterialApp with OverlaySupport.global.
// 3. The MaterialApp sets the title and home screen of the app.
// 4. HomeScreen is a StatelessWidget that builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. The Center widget contains an ElevatedButton.
// 6. When the button is pressed, it triggers the showSimpleNotification function.
// 7. This function displays a notification at the top of the screen with a message and a green background.
