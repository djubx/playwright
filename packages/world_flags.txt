# Complete Example of Using the "world_flags" Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:world_flags/world_flags.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'World Flags Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('World Flags Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying the flag of the United States
              WorldFlags.flag('US', size: 100.0), // Flag of the US
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between flags
              // Displaying the flag of Canada
              WorldFlags.flag('CA', size: 100.0), // Flag of Canada
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between flags
              // Displaying the flag of Japan
              WorldFlags.flag('JP', size: 100.0), // Flag of Japan
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'World Flags Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is a Center widget that centers its child.
// 5. Inside the Center, a Column widget is used to arrange the flags vertically.
// 6. Each flag is displayed using the WorldFlags.flag() method, specifying the country code and size.
// 7. SizedBox widgets are used to add spacing between the flags for better visual separation.

In summary, this example demonstrates how to effectively use the `world_flags` package to display country flags in a Flutter application. The application initializes with a simple layout, showcasing flags for the United States, Canada, and Japan, providing a clear and visually appealing interface.
