# Tutorial: Setting Up Another Audio Recorder

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **another_audio_recorder** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the **another_audio_recorder** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  another_audio_recorder: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/another_audio_recorder).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request microphone access:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to the microphone to record audio.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to the photo library to save recordings.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that we have set up the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to record audio.

# Complete Example: Audio Recorder Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:another_audio_recorder/another_audio_recorder.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  bool isRecording = false; // Track recording state
  String filePath = ''; // Path to save the recorded audio

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the audio recorder
    _initializeRecorder();
  }

  Future<void> _initializeRecorder() async {
    // Set the file path for the recording
    filePath = '/path/to/your/audio/file.m4a'; // Change this to a valid path
    await AnotherAudioRecorder.initialize(); // Initialize the recorder
  }

  Future<void> _startRecording() async {
    // Start recording audio
    await AnotherAudioRecorder.start(filePath: filePath);
    setState(() {
      isRecording = true; // Update the recording state
    });
  }

  Future<void> _stopRecording() async {
    // Stop recording audio
    await AnotherAudioRecorder.stop();
    setState(() {
      isRecording = false; // Update the recording state
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Audio Recorder Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              Text(isRecording ? 'Recording...' : 'Press the button to record'),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: isRecording ? _stopRecording : _startRecording,
                child: Text(isRecording ? 'Stop Recording' : 'Start Recording'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget, we initialize the audio recorder in the initState method.
// 3. The UI consists of a text widget that indicates whether the app is currently recording and a button to start/stop recording.
// 4. When the button is pressed, it calls either _startRecording or _stopRecording based on the current recording state.
// 5. The _startRecording method initializes the recording process and updates the UI state.
// 6. The _stopRecording method stops the recording and updates the UI state accordingly.
```
