# Overview of the smile_id Flutter Package

The `smile_id` Flutter package is designed to facilitate the integration of facial recognition and identity verification features into Flutter applications. This package is particularly useful for developers looking to implement biometric authentication, user verification, or any application that requires secure identity confirmation.

## When to Use This Package
- **User Authentication**: Enhance security by allowing users to log in using facial recognition.
- **Identity Verification**: Verify user identities in applications such as banking, healthcare, or any service requiring secure access.
- **User Experience**: Improve user experience by providing a seamless login process without the need for passwords.

## Key Features
- **Facial Recognition**: Leverage advanced algorithms for accurate facial recognition.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that allows for quick setup and implementation.
- **Customizable UI**: Offers options to customize the user interface to match your app's design.

The `smile_id` package is a powerful tool for developers aiming to enhance security and user experience in their applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the smile_id Package

## Installation
To get started with the `smile_id` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  smile_id: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/smile_id).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

3. Ensure that your app's `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request camera access:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera for facial recognition.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library for identity verification.</string>
```

## Using the Package
To use the `smile_id` package, you can create a simple Flutter application that utilizes its features. Below is a basic example of how to implement facial recognition.

<!-- END_TUTORIAL -->

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:smile_id/smile_id.dart'; // Import the smile_id package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the main application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Smile ID Example',
      home: HomeScreen(), // Set the home screen
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  String _result = "Press the button to start facial recognition"; // Result message

  // Function to initiate facial recognition
  void _startFacialRecognition() async {
    try {
      // Start the facial recognition process
      final result = await SmileId.startRecognition();
      setState(() {
        _result = result ? "Recognition Successful!" : "Recognition Failed!";
      });
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        _result = "Error: $e"; // Handle any errors
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Smile ID Example'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(_result), // Display the result message
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _startFacialRecognition, // Button to start recognition
              child: Text('Start Facial Recognition'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget sets up a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget maintains a state that holds the result of the facial recognition.
// 4. When the user presses the button, the _startFacialRecognition function is called.
// 5. This function invokes the SmileId.startRecognition method to initiate the facial recognition process.
// 6. Depending on the result, the state is updated to show whether the recognition was successful or failed.
// 7. The result is displayed on the screen, providing feedback to the user.
```
