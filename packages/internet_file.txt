# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Internet File Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **internet_file** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  internet_file: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to add the following permissions in your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save downloaded files.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio files.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the **internet_file** package in your Flutter application:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:internet_file/internet_file.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Internet File Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // URL of the file to download
              String fileUrl = 'https://example.com/sample.pdf';
              // Download the file
              String filePath = await InternetFile.download(fileUrl);
              // Notify the user
              ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                SnackBar(content: Text('File downloaded to: $filePath')),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Download File'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app with a button that, when pressed, downloads a file from a specified URL and displays the download path.

# Complete Example of Internet File Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:internet_file/internet_file.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Internet File Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // URL of the file to download
              String fileUrl = 'https://example.com/sample.pdf';
              // Download the file
              String filePath = await InternetFile.download(fileUrl);
              // Notify the user
              ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                SnackBar(content: Text('File downloaded to: $filePath')),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Download File'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which builds a MaterialApp.
// 2. The app contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, there is an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, it triggers the onPressed callback.
// 5. The callback defines a URL for the file to be downloaded.
// 6. It calls the InternetFile.download method with the file URL.
// 7. Once the file is downloaded, it retrieves the file path.
// 8. A SnackBar is displayed to notify the user of the download location.
