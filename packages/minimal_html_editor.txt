# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `minimal_html_editor`

## Installation
To add the `minimal_html_editor` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  minimal_html_editor: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
Ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    compileSdkVersion 31  // or the latest version
    ...
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, make sure to set the minimum deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `minimal_html_editor`, you can create a simple Flutter widget that incorporates the editor. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:minimal_html_editor/minimal_html_editor.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Minimal HTML Editor Example')),
        body: HtmlEditor(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application with an HTML editor. You can further customize the editor by adding features like toolbar options, saving content, and more.

# Complete Example of `minimal_html_editor`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:minimal_html_editor/minimal_html_editor.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Controller to manage the HTML editor
  final HtmlEditorController _controller = HtmlEditorController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Minimal HTML Editor Example'),
          actions: [
            IconButton(
              icon: Icon(Icons.save),
              onPressed: () async {
                // Save the content from the editor
                String? content = await _controller.getText();
                // Here you can handle the content, e.g., save it to a database
                print(content);
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
        body: HtmlEditor(
          controller: _controller, // Assign the controller to the editor
          height: 400, // Set the height of the editor
          // Additional configurations can be added here
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```
// The above code creates a simple Flutter application with a minimal HTML editor.
// 1. We import the necessary packages and create a StatefulWidget called RealFlutter.
// 2. Inside the state class, we initialize an HtmlEditorController to manage the editor's state.
// 3. In the build method, we create a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 4. The AppBar contains a title and a save button that, when pressed, retrieves the HTML content from the editor.
// 5. The HtmlEditor widget is placed in the body of the Scaffold, with the controller assigned to it.
// 6. The height of the editor is set to 400 pixels, but this can be adjusted as needed.
// 7. When the save button is pressed, the content is printed to the console, but you can modify this to save it to a database or perform other actions.
