# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Mobkit Calendar

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **mobkit_calendar** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **mobkit_calendar** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  mobkit_calendar: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if your app requires access to the user's calendar:

```xml
<key>NSCalendarsUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your calendar.</string>
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:mobkit_calendar/mobkit_calendar.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Calendar Widget

You can now use the `MobkitCalendar` widget in your application. Below is an example of how to implement it.

# Complete Example of Mobkit Calendar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mobkit_calendar/mobkit_calendar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Mobkit Calendar Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: CalendarHome(),
    );
  }
}

class CalendarHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CalendarHomeState createState() => _CalendarHomeState();
}

class _CalendarHomeState extends State<CalendarHome> {
  // List to hold events
  List<Event> events = [];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Mobkit Calendar'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Calendar widget
          Expanded(
            child: MobkitCalendar(
              onDateSelected: (date) {
                // Handle date selection
                print('Selected date: $date');
              },
              onEventAdded: (event) {
                // Handle event addition
                setState(() {
                  events.add(event);
                });
                print('Event added: ${event.title}');
              },
              events: events,
            ),
          ),
          // Button to add a new event
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Example of adding a new event
              final newEvent = Event(
                title: 'New Event',
                date: DateTime.now(),
              );
              setState(() {
                events.add(newEvent);
              });
            },
            child: Text('Add Event'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home widget is CalendarHome, which manages the state of the calendar.
// 4. Inside CalendarHome, we define a list to hold events.
// 5. The MobkitCalendar widget is displayed, which allows users to select dates and add events.
// 6. When a date is selected, it prints the selected date to the console.
// 7. When an event is added, it updates the events list and prints the event title.
// 8. A button is provided to add a new event, demonstrating how to interact with the calendar.
