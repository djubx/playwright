# DataClass Flutter Package
The DataClass package is a powerful tool for simplifying data management in Flutter applications. It provides a simple and efficient way to create, manage, and store data models, making it an essential package for any Flutter developer.

## When to Use DataClass
DataClass is perfect for applications that require complex data management, such as:

* Storing and retrieving user data
* Managing application settings
* Caching data from APIs
* Creating data-driven UI components

## Features of DataClass
Some of the key features of DataClass include:

* Automatic generation of boilerplate code for data models
* Support for serialization and deserialization of data
* Easy data validation and error handling
* Integration with popular Flutter packages, such as Provider and Riverpod

# Setting Up DataClass
To use DataClass in your Flutter application, follow these steps:

1. Add the DataClass package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  dataclass: ^1.0.0
```
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.
3. Import the DataClass package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:dataclass/dataclass.dart';
```
4. Create a new data model using the `@DataClass` annotation:
```dart
@DataClass
class RealFlutter {
  final String title;
  final String description;
}
```
5. Use the `RealFlutter` data model in your application:
```dart
void main() {
  final realFlutter = RealFlutter(title: 'Hello', description: 'World');
  print(realFlutter.title); // prints 'Hello'
}
```
### Platform-Specific Details
DataClass works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms. However, if you're using a specific platform feature, such as Android's SharedPreferences or iOS's UserDefaults, you'll need to configure DataClass accordingly.

For example, to use SharedPreferences on Android, add the following code to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:
```xml
<application>
  <meta-data
    android:name="flutter embedding"
    android:resource="@array/flutter_embedding" />
  <meta-data
    android:name="dataclass.shared_preferences"
    android:value="true" />
</application>
```
Similarly, to use UserDefaults on iOS, add the following code to your `Info.plist` file:
```xml
<key>NSUserDefault</key>
<dict>
  <key>DataClass</key>
  <true/>
</dict>
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dataclass/dataclass.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'DataClass Demo',
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  // Create a new data model using the @DataClass annotation
  @DataClass
  class RealFlutter {
    final String title;
    final String description;
  }

  // Initialize the data model with some data
  final realFlutter = RealFlutter(title: 'Hello', description: 'World');

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('DataClass Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display the title of the data model
            Text(realFlutter.title),

            // Display the description of the data model
            Text(realFlutter.description),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the application.
// 2. The application creates a new instance of the RealFlutter data model.
// 3. The application initializes the data model with some data.
// 4. The application displays the title and description of the data model on the screen.
// 5. The user can interact with the application, such as tapping on the screen.
// 6. The application responds to the user's interactions, such as updating the data model.
// 7. The application displays the updated data model on the screen.

// In summary, the application creates a new data model, initializes it with some data, and displays it on the screen.
// The user can interact with the application, and the application responds by updating the data model and displaying it on the screen.
