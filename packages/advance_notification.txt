# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Advance Notification

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **advance_notification** package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **advance_notification** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  advance_notification: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `AndroidManifest.xml` located in `android/app/src/main/`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.VIBRATE"/>
```

3. Ensure you have the correct notification channel setup in your main activity or wherever you initialize notifications.

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `Info.plist` located in `ios/Runner/`.
2. Add the following keys to request permission for notifications:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>fetch</string>
    <string>remote-notification</string>
</array>
<key>NSUserNotificationAlertStyle</key>
<string>alert</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your Flutter application.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:advance_notification/advance_notification.dart';
```

2. Initialize the notification service in your main application file:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
  AdvanceNotification.initialize();
}
```

3. Create and display a notification:

```dart
void showNotification() {
  AdvanceNotification.show(
    title: 'Hello!',
    body: 'This is a custom notification.',
    channelKey: 'basic_channel',
    notificationLayout: NotificationLayout.Default,
    actions: [
      NotificationAction(
        key: 'reply',
        label: 'Reply',
      ),
    ],
  );
}
```

4. Call `showNotification()` wherever you want to trigger the notification, such as in a button's `onPressed` callback.

With these steps, you can successfully set up and use the **advance_notification** package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Advance Notification

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:advance_notification/advance_notification.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
  AdvanceNotification.initialize(); // Initialize the notification service
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Advance Notification Demo',
      home: NotificationHome(),
    );
  }
}

class NotificationHome extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Advance Notification Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            showNotification(); // Call the function to show notification
          },
          child: Text('Show Notification'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void showNotification() {
    // Display a notification with a title, body, and action button
    AdvanceNotification.show(
      title: 'Hello!',
      body: 'This is a custom notification.',
      channelKey: 'basic_channel',
      notificationLayout: NotificationLayout.Default,
      actions: [
        NotificationAction(
          key: 'reply',
          label: 'Reply',
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app and the AdvanceNotification service.
// 2. MyApp is the root widget that sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. NotificationHome is the main screen with a button to trigger the notification.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the showNotification function is called.
// 5. The showNotification function creates and displays a notification with a title, body, and an action button.
// 6. Users can interact with the notification through the action button, enhancing engagement.
