# Device User Agent Flutter Package

The `device_user_agent` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to help developers retrieve the user agent string of the device on which their Flutter application is running. This can be particularly useful for analytics, debugging, and tailoring user experiences based on the device type.

## When to Use This Package
- **Analytics**: Collect user agent data for analytics purposes to understand the devices your users are using.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Adjust UI elements based on the device type (e.g., mobile vs. tablet).
- **Debugging**: Identify issues that may be specific to certain devices or browsers.

## Features
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API to fetch the user agent string.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead, ensuring your app remains performant.

With these features, `device_user_agent` is an essential package for developers looking to enhance their Flutter applications with device-specific capabilities.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Device User Agent

## Installation
To add the `device_user_agent` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  device_user_agent: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. The package works out of the box.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` file if you plan to access any device-specific features. However, for just retrieving the user agent, no special permissions are needed.

## Using the Package
To use the `device_user_agent` package, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:
   ```dart
   import 'package:device_user_agent/device_user_agent.dart';
   ```

2. Create a method to fetch the user agent:
   ```dart
   Future<String> getUserAgent() async {
     String userAgent = await DeviceUserAgent.getUserAgent();
     return userAgent;
   }
   ```

3. Call this method in your widget to display the user agent string.

With these steps, you can easily integrate the `device_user_agent` package into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Device User Agent

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:device_user_agent/device_user_agent.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Device User Agent Example',
      home: UserAgentScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class UserAgentScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _UserAgentScreenState createState() => _UserAgentScreenState();
}

class _UserAgentScreenState extends State<UserAgentScreen> {
  String _userAgent = 'Fetching user agent...'; // Initial state

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _fetchUserAgent(); // Fetch user agent when the widget is initialized
  }

  // Method to fetch the user agent
  Future<void> _fetchUserAgent() async {
    String userAgent = await DeviceUserAgent.getUserAgent(); // Call the package method
    setState(() {
      _userAgent = userAgent; // Update the state with the fetched user agent
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Device User Agent'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          _userAgent, // Display the user agent string
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (UserAgentScreen).
// 3. UserAgentScreen is a stateful widget that initializes the user agent string.
// 4. In the initState method, _fetchUserAgent is called to retrieve the user agent string.
// 5. _fetchUserAgent uses the DeviceUserAgent package to get the user agent and updates the state.
// 6. The build method displays the user agent string in the center of the screen.
// 7. The user agent string is updated dynamically as soon as it is fetched.
