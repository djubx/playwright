# gsy_video_player: Setup and Usage Tutorial

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  gsy_video_player: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/gsy_video_player).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions to allow video playback:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `gsy_video_player`, you can create a simple video player widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gsy_video_player/gsy_video_player.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('GSY Video Player Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: GSYVideoPlayer(
            videoUrl: 'https://www.example.com/video.mp4',
            autoPlay: true,
            looping: true,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple app with a video player that plays a video from a URL. The `autoPlay` and `looping` properties are set to true, allowing the video to start automatically and loop indefinitely.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate `gsy_video_player` into your Flutter application successfully.

# Complete Example of gsy_video_player

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gsy_video_player/gsy_video_player.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('GSY Video Player Example')),
        body: Center(
          // The GSYVideoPlayer widget is used to display the video
          child: GSYVideoPlayer(
            // URL of the video to be played
            videoUrl: 'https://www.example.com/video.mp4',
            // Automatically play the video when the widget is built
            autoPlay: true,
            // Loop the video indefinitely
            looping: true,
            // Optional: Customize the player controls
            controls: GSYVideoControls(
              // Add custom controls if needed
            ),
            // Event listener for when the video is finished playing
            onVideoFinished: () {
              // Handle video finished event
              print('Video has finished playing');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The MaterialApp widget is created, providing the overall structure of the app.
// 3. A Scaffold widget is used to create the basic visual layout, including an AppBar and a body.
// 4. In the body, a Center widget is used to center the video player on the screen.
// 5. The GSYVideoPlayer widget is instantiated with a video URL, set to auto-play and loop.
// 6. Custom controls can be added if needed, and an event listener is set up to handle when the video finishes playing.
// 7. When the video finishes, a message is printed to the console.
