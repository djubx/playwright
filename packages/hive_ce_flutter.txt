# Setting Up and Using Hive CE Flutter

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the **hive_ce_flutter** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **hive_ce_flutter** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  hive_ce_flutter: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, you need to ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21. Open the `android/app/build.gradle` file and modify the `defaultConfig` section:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to enable the use of Swift in your project. Open the `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` file in Xcode and ensure that the project settings are configured correctly.

## Step 4: Initialize Hive

Before using Hive, you need to initialize it in your main application file. This is typically done in the `main()` function:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:hive/hive.dart';
import 'package:path_provider/path_provider.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  final directory = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
  Hive.init(directory.path);
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 5: Using Hive

You can now create a box (a collection of key-value pairs) and start storing data. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use Hive to store and retrieve data:

```dart
void main() async {
  // Initialize Hive
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  final directory = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
  Hive.init(directory.path);

  // Open a box
  var box = await Hive.openBox('myBox');

  // Add data to the box
  await box.put('name', 'RealFlutter');

  // Retrieve data from the box
  var name = box.get('name');
  print(name); // Output: RealFlutter
}
```

With these steps, you have successfully set up and used the **hive_ce_flutter** package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Hive CE Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:hive/hive.dart';
import 'package:path_provider/path_provider.dart';

void main() async {
  // Ensure that widget binding is initialized
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  
  // Get the application documents directory
  final directory = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
  
  // Initialize Hive with the directory path
  Hive.init(directory.path);
  
  // Open a box named 'myBox' for storing data
  var box = await Hive.openBox('myBox');
  
  // Run the Flutter app
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Hive CE Flutter Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Hive CE Flutter Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Button to save data
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () async {
                  // Store a name in the box
                  var box = await Hive.openBox('myBox');
                  await box.put('name', 'RealFlutter');
                },
                child: Text('Save Name'),
              ),
              // Button to retrieve data
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () async {
                  // Retrieve the name from the box
                  var box = await Hive.openBox('myBox');
                  var name = box.get('name');
                  // Show the name in a dialog
                  showDialog(
                    context: context,
                    builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                      title: Text('Stored Name'),
                      content: Text(name ?? 'No name found'),
                      actions: [
                        TextButton(
                          onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                          child: Text('OK'),
                        ),
                      ],
                    ),
                  );
                },
                child: Text('Retrieve Name'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
// Explanation of the application flow:

// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app and Hive database.
// 2. It retrieves the application documents directory to store the Hive data.
// 3. The 'myBox' box is opened for storing key-value pairs.
// 4. The RealFlutter widget is created, which contains a MaterialApp.
// 5. Inside the app, there are two buttons: one for saving a name and another for retrieving it.
// 6. When the "Save Name" button is pressed, the name 'RealFlutter' is stored in the Hive box.
// 7. When the "Retrieve Name" button is pressed, the app retrieves the stored name and displays it in a dialog.
// 8. The dialog shows the retrieved name or a message if no name is found, allowing users to confirm the stored data.
