// This is the main entry point of the app.
// The native_notify package is initialized with the app ID and token.
// The app ID and token should be replaced with the actual values.

// The MyApp widget is the root widget of the app.
// It uses the MaterialApp widget to provide a material design theme.

// The MyHomePage widget is the home page of the app.
// It uses the Scaffold widget to provide a basic material design layout.

// In the initState method, a notification is scheduled using the NativeNotify.schedule method.
// The notification is scheduled to be displayed 10 seconds from now.

// The onNotificationTap callback is used to handle notification taps.
// When a notification is tapped, a message is printed to the console.

// The build method returns the widget tree of the app.
// It uses the Center widget to center the text "Hello, World!".

// This is a basic example of how to use the native_notify package.
// The package provides more features, such as customizing the notification content and adding custom actions.
