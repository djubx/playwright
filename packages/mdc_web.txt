# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using mdc_web

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `mdc_web` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  mdc_web: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### For Android

1. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Enable web support in your Flutter project if you haven't already:

   ```bash
   flutter config --enable-web
   ```

### For iOS

1. Open your `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode.
2. Ensure that your deployment target is set to at least iOS 9.0 in the project settings.

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the `mdc_web` package:

```dart
import 'package:mdc_web/mdc_web.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package

You can now start using the components provided by the `mdc_web` package. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a basic web application using the package.

# Complete Example of Using mdc_web

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mdc_web/mdc_web.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // The MaterialApp widget is the root of the application.
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'MDC Web Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Scaffold provides a structure for the visual interface.
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('MDC Web Home Page'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        // Center widget centers its child within itself.
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Welcome to MDC Web!',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adds space between widgets.
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action to be performed when the button is pressed.
                showDialog(
                  context: context,
                  builder: (BuildContext context) {
                    return AlertDialog(
                      title: Text('Hello!'),
                      content: Text('This is a dialog from MDC Web.'),
                      actions: <Widget>[
                        TextButton(
                          child: Text('Close'),
                          onPressed: () {
                            Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Closes the dialog.
                          },
                        ),
                      ],
                    );
                  },
                );
              },
              child: Text('Show Dialog'), // Button text.
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp has a title and a theme, and it sets HomePage as the home widget.
// 4. HomePage is a StatelessWidget that builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. The Center widget contains a Column with a welcome text and a button.
// 6. When the button is pressed, it shows an AlertDialog with a message and a close button.
// 7. The close button dismisses the dialog when pressed.
```
