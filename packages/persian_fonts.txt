# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Persian Fonts Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `persian_fonts` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `persian_fonts` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  persian_fonts: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package
Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Configuring for Android
For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configuration:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        // Ensure that the minimum SDK version is set to at least 21
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

## Step 4: Configuring for iOS
For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file to support custom fonts:

```xml
<key>UIAppFonts</key>
<array>
    <string>YourCustomFont.ttf</string>
</array>
```

Make sure to replace `YourCustomFont.ttf` with the actual font files you are using.

## Step 5: Using the Package
Now that the package is set up, you can use it in your Flutter application. Here’s how to apply a Persian font to a `Text` widget:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:persian_fonts/persian_fonts.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Persian Fonts Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(
            'سلام دنیا', // "Hello World" in Persian
            style: PersianFonts.vazir, // Using the Vazir font
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we import the `persian_fonts` package and use the `Vazir` font to display Persian text.

# Complete Example of Using Persian Fonts

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:persian_fonts/persian_fonts.dart';

// Main class of the application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Persian Fonts Demo', // Title of the application
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Persian Fonts Example'), // AppBar title
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying Persian text using the Vazir font
              Text(
                'سلام دنیا', // "Hello World" in Persian
                style: PersianFonts.vazir.copyWith(fontSize: 24), // Applying the Vazir font
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between texts
              // Displaying another Persian text using the Sahel font
              Text(
                'خوش آمدید', // "Welcome" in Persian
                style: PersianFonts.sahel.copyWith(fontSize: 24), // Applying the Sahel font
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the RealFlutter application
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Persian Fonts Example".
4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Column widget.
5. Inside the Column, two Text widgets display Persian text:
   - The first Text widget shows "سلام دنیا" using the Vazir font.
   - The second Text widget shows "خوش آمدید" using the Sahel font.
6. The application is structured to be easily extendable, allowing for more Persian text and styles to be added as needed.
