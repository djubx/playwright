# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Simple Animated Button

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **simple_animated_button** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  simple_animated_button: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the animated button, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:simple_animated_button/simple_animated_button.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Animated Button

You can now use the `SimpleAnimatedButton` widget in your Flutter application. Below is a basic example of how to implement it:

```dart
SimpleAnimatedButton(
  onTap: () {
    // Action to perform on button tap
  },
  text: 'Click Me',
  duration: Duration(milliseconds: 300),
  curve: Curves.easeInOut,
  // Additional properties can be set here
);
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Customizing the Button

You can customize the button further by adjusting properties such as `color`, `textColor`, and `borderRadius`. Hereâ€™s an example:

```dart
SimpleAnimatedButton(
  onTap: () {
    // Action to perform on button tap
  },
  text: 'Click Me',
  duration: Duration(milliseconds: 300),
  curve: Curves.easeInOut,
  color: Colors.blue,
  textColor: Colors.white,
  borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(8.0),
);
```

With these steps, you can easily set up and use the **simple_animated_button** package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Simple Animated Button

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simple_animated_button/simple_animated_button.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Simple Animated Button Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Animated Button Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: SimpleAnimatedButton(
            onTap: () {
              // Action to perform on button tap
              ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                SnackBar(content: Text('Button Pressed!')),
              );
            },
            text: 'Click Me',
            duration: Duration(milliseconds: 300),
            curve: Curves.easeInOut,
            color: Colors.blue,
            textColor: Colors.white,
            borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(8.0),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Animated Button Example'.
// 4. In the body of the Scaffold, a SimpleAnimatedButton is placed at the center.
// 5. When the button is tapped, it triggers the onTap function, which shows a SnackBar with the message 'Button Pressed!'.
// 6. The button has a blue background, white text, and rounded corners, with a smooth animation when pressed.
