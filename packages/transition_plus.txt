To get started with `transition_plus`, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  transition_plus: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the latest version of Xcode installed. No additional configurations are necessary for using `transition_plus`.

## Basic Usage
To use `transition_plus`, you can wrap your navigation calls with the provided transition methods. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a fade transition:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:transition_plus/transition_plus.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: FirstScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class FirstScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('First Screen')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate to the second screen with a fade transition
            Navigator.of(context).push(
              TransitionPage(
                page: SecondScreen(),
                type: TransitionType.fade,
              ),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Go to Second Screen'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SecondScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Second Screen')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Welcome to the Second Screen!')),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, the app navigates to the `SecondScreen` with a fade transition effect.

# Complete Example of Transition Plus

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:transition_plus/transition_plus.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: FirstScreen(), // Start the app with the FirstScreen
    );
  }
}

class FirstScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('First Screen')), // AppBar for the first screen
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate to the second screen with a fade transition
            Navigator.of(context).push(
              TransitionPage(
                page: SecondScreen(), // The page to navigate to
                type: TransitionType.fade, // Specify the transition type
              ),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Go to Second Screen'), // Button to trigger navigation
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SecondScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Second Screen')), // AppBar for the second screen
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to the Second Screen!'), // Display a message
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which initializes the MaterialApp.
// 2. The home property of MaterialApp is set to FirstScreen, which is the initial screen.
// 3. In FirstScreen, there is an ElevatedButton that, when pressed, triggers navigation.
// 4. The Navigator pushes a new TransitionPage onto the stack, specifying SecondScreen as the page to navigate to.
// 5. The TransitionType.fade is used to create a fade effect during the transition.
// 6. SecondScreen is displayed with its own AppBar and a message in the center.
