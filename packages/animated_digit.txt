# Animated Digit Flutter Package

The `animated_digit` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to create animated digit displays in your Flutter applications. This package is particularly useful for applications that require dynamic number displays, such as scoreboards, counters, or any application where numerical data needs to be presented in an engaging way.

## When to Use This Package
You might consider using the `animated_digit` package in scenarios such as:
- **Scoreboards**: Displaying scores in real-time during games or competitions.
- **Counters**: Showing the number of items, likes, or any other count that changes dynamically.
- **Dashboards**: Presenting statistics or metrics that need to be visually appealing and easy to read.

## Features
- **Smooth Animations**: The package provides smooth transitions between numbers, enhancing user experience.
- **Customizable**: You can customize the appearance of the digits, including colors, sizes, and animation durations.
- **Easy Integration**: The package is easy to integrate into existing Flutter applications with minimal setup.

Overall, the `animated_digit` package is a great choice for developers looking to add dynamic number displays to their Flutter applications, making data presentation more interactive and visually appealing.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Animated Digit Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the `animated_digit` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  animated_digit: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `animated_digit` package in your app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_digit/animated_digit.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Animated Digit Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: AnimatedDigit(
            value: 1234, // The initial value
            duration: Duration(seconds: 1), // Animation duration
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 48, color: Colors.blue), // Custom style
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays an animated digit. The `AnimatedDigit` widget takes a value, a duration for the animation, and a style for the text.

## Summary
In this tutorial, we covered how to set up the `animated_digit` package in your Flutter application, including platform-specific configurations for Android and iOS. We also provided a simple example of how to use the package to display animated digits.

# Complete Example of Animated Digit Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_digit/animated_digit.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  int _counter = 0; // Initialize the counter

  // Function to increment the counter
  void _incrementCounter() {
    setState(() {
      _counter++; // Increment the counter
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Animated Digit Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // AnimatedDigit widget to display the counter
              AnimatedDigit(
                value: _counter, // Current value of the counter
                duration: Duration(seconds: 1), // Animation duration
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 48, color: Colors.blue), // Custom style
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between widgets
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _incrementCounter, // Increment counter on button press
                child: Text('Increment Counter'), // Button text
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation
// The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` widget.
// The `RealFlutter` widget is a stateful widget that maintains the state of the counter.
// The `_counter` variable is initialized to 0.
// The `_incrementCounter` function increments the counter and calls `setState` to update the UI.
// In the `build` method, we create a `MaterialApp` with a `Scaffold`.
// The `Scaffold` contains an `AppBar` and a `Center` widget that holds a `Column`.
// The `Column` contains the `AnimatedDigit` widget, which displays the current value of `_counter`.
// The `AnimatedDigit` widget animates the transition between numbers.
// Below the animated digit, there is an `ElevatedButton` that, when pressed, calls the `_incrementCounter` function.
// This setup allows users to increment the counter and see the animated digit update in real-time.
