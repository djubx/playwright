# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Flex Dropdown

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **flex_dropdown** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flex_dropdown: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flex_dropdown/flex_dropdown.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Flex Dropdown

You can now use the `FlexDropdown` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
FlexDropdown(
  items: ['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3'],
  onChanged: (value) {
    // Handle the selected value
    print('Selected: $value');
  },
  hint: 'Select an item',
)
```

This basic setup will create a dropdown with three items. You can customize it further by adding styles, icons, and more.

# Complete Example of Flex Dropdown

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flex_dropdown/flex_dropdown.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flex Dropdown Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flex Dropdown Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: DropdownExample(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DropdownExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DropdownExampleState createState() => _DropdownExampleState();
}

class _DropdownExampleState extends State<DropdownExample> {
  String? selectedItem; // Variable to hold the selected item

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        // FlexDropdown widget
        FlexDropdown(
          items: ['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3', 'Item 4'],
          onChanged: (value) {
            setState(() {
              selectedItem = value; // Update the selected item
            });
          },
          hint: 'Select an item',
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between dropdown and text
        // Display the selected item
        Text(
          selectedItem != null ? 'Selected: $selectedItem' : 'No item selected',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a centered body.
// 3. The DropdownExample widget is created, which maintains the state of the selected item.
// 4. Inside DropdownExample, a FlexDropdown widget is displayed with a list of items.
// 5. When an item is selected, the onChanged callback updates the selectedItem state variable.
// 6. The selected item is displayed below the dropdown, updating dynamically as the user makes a selection.
```
