# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using format_date

## Installation
To use the `format_date` package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  format_date: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
The `format_date` package works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms. There are no additional configurations required for either platform, making it easy to integrate into your Flutter application.

## Basic Usage
To use the `format_date` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:format_date/format_date.dart';
```

You can then format a DateTime object as follows:

```dart
DateTime now = DateTime.now();
String formattedDate = formatDate(now, [yyyy, '-', mm, '-', dd]);
```

This will output the current date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.

### Example of Formatting with Locale
To format a date according to a specific locale, you can do the following:

```dart
String formattedDate = formatDate(now, [dd, ' ', M, ' ', yyyy], locale: 'fr_FR');
```

This will format the date in French, resulting in something like `25 Octobre 2023`.

With these simple steps, you can easily integrate and utilize the `format_date` package in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of format_date in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:format_date/format_date.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Format Date Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Date Formatting Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: DateDisplay(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DateDisplay extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Get the current date and time
    DateTime now = DateTime.now();

    // Format the date in different styles
    String formattedDate1 = formatDate(now, [yyyy, '-', mm, '-', dd]);
    String formattedDate2 = formatDate(now, [dd, ' ', M, ' ', yyyy], locale: 'fr_FR');
    String formattedDate3 = formatDate(now, [hh, ':', nn, ' ', am]);

    // Display the formatted dates
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Text('Formatted Date (YYYY-MM-DD): $formattedDate1'),
        Text('Formatted Date (French): $formattedDate2'),
        Text('Formatted Time (12-hour format): $formattedDate3'),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds the DateDisplay widget.
// 4. The DateDisplay widget retrieves the current date and formats it in three different styles.
// 5. Finally, the formatted dates are displayed in a Column widget, centered on the screen.
