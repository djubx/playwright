In summary, this code demonstrates how to use the `format_date` package to format dates in different ways and convert dates between different time zones. The app displays the current date and time in three different formats: yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss, MM/dd/yyyy, and UTC. The user can see the current date and time in these formats and understand how to use the `format_date` package to format dates in their own app.
