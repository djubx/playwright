# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Device Friendly Name Package

## Installation
To get started with the `device_friendly_name` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  device_friendly_name: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/device_friendly_name).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you are accessing device-specific information. However, for basic usage of this package, no additional permissions are required.

## Using the Package
Once you have installed the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to retrieve and display the friendly name of the device.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:device_friendly_name/device_friendly_name.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Device Friendly Name Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: FutureBuilder<String>(
            future: DeviceFriendlyName.getFriendlyName(),
            builder: (context, snapshot) {
              if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                return CircularProgressIndicator();
              } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
                return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}');
              } else {
                return Text('Device Name: ${snapshot.data}');
              }
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we use a `FutureBuilder` to asynchronously fetch the friendly name of the device and display it in the center of the screen.

# Complete Example of Device Friendly Name Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:device_friendly_name/device_friendly_name.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Device Friendly Name Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          // Using FutureBuilder to handle asynchronous data fetching
          child: FutureBuilder<String>(
            // Fetching the friendly name of the device
            future: DeviceFriendlyName.getFriendlyName(),
            builder: (context, snapshot) {
              // While waiting for the data, show a loading indicator
              if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                return CircularProgressIndicator();
              } 
              // If there's an error, display it
              else if (snapshot.hasError) {
                return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}');
              } 
              // Once data is fetched, display the friendly device name
              else {
                return Text('Device Name: ${snapshot.data}');
              }
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, a FutureBuilder is used to fetch the device's friendly name asynchronously.
// 4. While the data is being fetched, a CircularProgressIndicator is displayed.
// 5. If an error occurs during the fetch, it is displayed on the screen.
// 6. Once the friendly name is retrieved, it is displayed in the center of the screen.
```

In summary, the `device_friendly_name` package provides a straightforward way to retrieve user-friendly device names in Flutter applications. The example above demonstrates how to set up the package, handle asynchronous data fetching, and display the device name effectively. This package is particularly useful in applications that require clear identification of devices, enhancing user experience and interaction.
