# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Zoom Hover Pinch Image Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `zoom_hover_pinch_image` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  zoom_hover_pinch_image: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configurations

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file, especially if you are loading images from the internet:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:zoom_hover_pinch_image/zoom_hover_pinch_image.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package
You can now use the `ZoomHoverPinchImage` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
ZoomHoverPinchImage(
  image: NetworkImage('https://example.com/image.jpg'), // Image source
  minScale: 1.0, // Minimum zoom level
  maxScale: 4.0, // Maximum zoom level
  hoverColor: Colors.blue.withOpacity(0.5), // Color on hover
),
```

This widget will allow users to pinch to zoom on the image and see a hover effect when they interact with it.

# Complete Example of Using Zoom Hover Pinch Image

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:zoom_hover_pinch_image/zoom_hover_pinch_image.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Zoom Hover Pinch Image Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Zoom Hover Pinch Image Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ZoomHoverPinchImage(
            image: NetworkImage('https://example.com/image.jpg'), // Image source
            minScale: 1.0, // Minimum zoom level
            maxScale: 4.0, // Maximum zoom level
            hoverColor: Colors.blue.withOpacity(0.5), // Color on hover
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Zoom Hover Pinch Image Demo".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers the ZoomHoverPinchImage widget.
// 5. The ZoomHoverPinchImage widget takes a NetworkImage as its image source.
// 6. Users can pinch to zoom in and out of the image, and a hover effect is applied when they interact with the image.
