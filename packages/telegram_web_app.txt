# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Telegram Web App Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `telegram_web_app` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `telegram_web_app` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  telegram_web_app: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev).

## Step 2: Configure for Android

For Android, you need to ensure that your app has the correct permissions and configurations. Open the `AndroidManifest.xml` file located in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

## Step 3: Configure for iOS

For iOS, you need to modify the `Info.plist` file located in `ios/Runner/Info.plist`. Add the following entries to allow your app to communicate with the Telegram Web App:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Initialize the Package

In your main Dart file, import the package and initialize it. You can do this in the `main()` function:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:telegram_web_app/telegram_web_app.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 5: Using the Package

You can now use the `telegram_web_app` package to create your web app. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set up a basic web app interface.

# Complete Example of a Telegram Web App

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:telegram_web_app/telegram_web_app.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Telegram Web App Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Telegram Web App'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text('Welcome to the Telegram Web App!'),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // This function will be called when the button is pressed
                  launchTelegramWebApp();
                },
                child: Text('Launch Web App'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void launchTelegramWebApp() {
    // This function uses the telegram_web_app package to launch the web app
    TelegramWebApp.launch();
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main() function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds a Column.
// 4. The Column displays a welcome message and a button.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the launchTelegramWebApp() function is called.
// 6. This function uses the TelegramWebApp.launch() method to open the web app in Telegram.
```
