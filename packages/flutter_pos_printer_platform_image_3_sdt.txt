# Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To add the `flutter_pos_printer_platform_image_3_sdt` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_pos_printer_platform_image_3_sdt: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_pos_printer_platform_image_3_sdt).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request permission for Bluetooth usage:

```xml
<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to Bluetooth to connect to printers.</string>
<key>NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to Bluetooth to connect to printers.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_pos_printer_platform_image_3_sdt/flutter_pos_printer_platform_image_3_sdt.dart';
```

You can then create an instance of the printer and use its methods to print images and text.

### Example Code Snippet
```dart
final printer = RealFlutter();
printer.connect('printer_address'); // Replace with your printer's address
printer.printImage('path_to_image'); // Replace with the image path
printer.printText('Hello, World!');
```

This snippet demonstrates how to connect to a printer and send print commands. Make sure to handle exceptions and errors appropriately in your production code.

# Complete Example of Using flutter_pos_printer_platform_image_3_sdt

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_pos_printer_platform_image_3_sdt/flutter_pos_printer_platform_image_3_sdt.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'POS Printer Example',
      home: PrinterHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class PrinterHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PrinterHomePageState createState() => _PrinterHomePageState();
}

class _PrinterHomePageState extends State<PrinterHomePage> {
  final RealFlutter printer = RealFlutter(); // Create an instance of the printer
  String printerStatus = 'Disconnected'; // Track printer status

  // Function to connect to the printer
  void connectToPrinter() async {
    try {
      await printer.connect('printer_address'); // Replace with your printer's address
      setState(() {
        printerStatus = 'Connected';
      });
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        printerStatus = 'Connection Failed: $e';
      });
    }
  }

  // Function to print an image and text
  void printReceipt() async {
    try {
      await printer.printImage('path_to_image'); // Replace with the image path
      await printer.printText('Hello, World!');
    } catch (e) {
      print('Print Failed: $e');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('POS Printer Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Printer Status: $printerStatus'), // Display printer status
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: connectToPrinter, // Connect button
              child: Text('Connect to Printer'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: printReceipt, // Print button
              child: Text('Print Receipt'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The PrinterHomePage widget is displayed, which contains the UI for connecting to the printer and printing.
// 3. The user can click the "Connect to Printer" button, which triggers the connectToPrinter function.
// 4. If the connection is successful, the printer status is updated to "Connected".
// 5. The user can then click the "Print Receipt" button, which triggers the printReceipt function.
// 6. The printReceipt function sends an image and text to the printer.
// 7. Any errors during connection or printing are caught and displayed in the UI.
