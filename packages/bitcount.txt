# Overview of the Bitcount Flutter Package

The **bitcount** package is a lightweight Flutter library designed to facilitate the counting of bits in binary representations of integers. This package is particularly useful in applications that require bit manipulation, such as cryptography, data compression, and low-level data processing. 

## When to Use Bitcount
- **Cryptography**: When working with encryption algorithms that require bit-level operations.
- **Data Compression**: For applications that need to analyze and manipulate binary data efficiently.
- **Game Development**: In scenarios where bitwise operations are used for game state management or optimization.

## Key Features
- **Efficient Bit Counting**: Quickly count the number of set bits (1s) in an integer.
- **Support for Various Data Types**: Works with both signed and unsigned integers.
- **Simple API**: Easy to integrate and use within any Flutter application.

The **bitcount** package simplifies the process of bit manipulation, making it an essential tool for developers working on performance-critical applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Bitcount Package

## Installation
To use the **bitcount** package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  bitcount: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
The **bitcount** package is designed to work seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms. There are no additional configurations required for either platform, making it straightforward to integrate into your Flutter application.

## Basic Usage
To use the **bitcount** package, you can import it into your Dart file as follows:

```dart
import 'package:bitcount/bitcount.dart';
```

You can then utilize the provided methods to count bits in integers. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
void main() {
  int number = 29; // Binary representation: 11101
  int count = Bitcount.countBits(number);
  print('Number of set bits in $number is $count'); // Output: 4
}
```

This example demonstrates how to count the number of set bits in the integer 29, which has a binary representation of `11101`, resulting in a count of 4.

With this setup, you are ready to start using the **bitcount** package in your Flutter applications!

# Complete Example of Using the Bitcount Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bitcount/bitcount.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Bitcount Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Bitcount Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: BitCountWidget(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class BitCountWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _BitCountWidgetState createState() => _BitCountWidgetState();
}

class _BitCountWidgetState extends State<BitCountWidget> {
  int _number = 0; // Variable to hold the number input
  int _bitCount = 0; // Variable to hold the count of set bits

  // Function to update the bit count based on user input
  void _updateBitCount() {
    setState(() {
      _bitCount = Bitcount.countBits(_number); // Count the bits in the number
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Text(
          'Enter a number:',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
        ),
        Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
          child: TextField(
            keyboardType: TextInputType.number,
            onChanged: (value) {
              _number = int.tryParse(value) ?? 0; // Parse the input to an integer
              _updateBitCount(); // Update the bit count whenever the input changes
            },
            decoration: InputDecoration(
              border: OutlineInputBorder(),
              hintText: 'Type a number',
            ),
          ),
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20),
        Text(
          'Number of set bits: $_bitCount', // Display the count of set bits
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a BitCountWidget.
// 3. BitCountWidget is a stateful widget that maintains the current number and its bit count.
// 4. The user is prompted to enter a number in a TextField.
// 5. When the user types a number, the onChanged callback updates the _number variable and calls _updateBitCount.
// 6. _updateBitCount uses the Bitcount package to count the set bits in the entered number and updates the UI.
// 7. The result is displayed in the Text widget, showing the number of set bits in real-time.
