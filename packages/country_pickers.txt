# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Country Pickers Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the **country_pickers** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  country_pickers: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` in your terminal to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` to allow for network requests if you are fetching country data from an API:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the country picker in your app.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:country_pickers/country_picker_utils.dart';
import 'package:country_pickers/country_picker_dialog.dart';
```

2. Create a function to show the country picker dialog:

```dart
void _showCountryPicker(BuildContext context) {
  showCountryPicker(
    context: context,
    onSelect: (Country country) {
      // Handle the selected country
      print('Selected country: ${country.name}');
    },
  );
}
```

3. Call this function from a button or any other widget in your UI.

With these steps, you can easily integrate the country picker into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using the Country Pickers Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:country_pickers/country_picker_utils.dart';
import 'package:country_pickers/country_picker_dialog.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Country Picker Example',
      home: CountryPickerHome(),
    );
  }
}

class CountryPickerHome extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Country Picker Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () => _showCountryPicker(context), // Show country picker on button press
          child: Text('Select Country'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to show the country picker dialog
  void _showCountryPicker(BuildContext context) {
    showCountryPicker(
      context: context,
      onSelect: (Country country) {
        // Handle the selected country
        print('Selected country: ${country.name}'); // Print selected country name
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget, CountryPickerHome.
// 3. CountryPickerHome displays a button in the center of the screen.
// 4. When the button is pressed, it triggers the _showCountryPicker function.
// 5. The _showCountryPicker function opens a dialog with a list of countries.
// 6. When a country is selected, its name is printed to the console.
```
