# Complete Example of cupertino_notification_bar_ui

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cupertino_notification_bar_ui/cupertino_notification_bar_ui.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Cupertino Notification Bar Example',
      home: NotificationDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class NotificationDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _NotificationDemoState createState() => _NotificationDemoState();
}

class _NotificationDemoState extends State<NotificationDemo> {
  // Variable to control the visibility of the notification bar
  bool _isNotificationVisible = false;

  // Function to show the notification
  void _showNotification() {
    setState(() {
      _isNotificationVisible = true; // Show the notification
    });

    // Hide the notification after 3 seconds
    Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3), () {
      setState(() {
        _isNotificationVisible = false; // Hide the notification
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Notification Bar Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _showNotification, // Show notification on button press
              child: Text('Show Notification'),
            ),
            // Display the notification bar if visible
            if (_isNotificationVisible)
              CupertinoNotificationBar(
                title: 'Success!',
                message: 'Your action was successful.',
                type: NotificationType.success,
              ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget (NotificationDemo).
// 3. NotificationDemo is a stateful widget that manages the visibility of the notification bar.
// 4. When the "Show Notification" button is pressed, the _showNotification function is called.
// 5. This function sets the _isNotificationVisible variable to true, displaying the notification bar.
// 6. After 3 seconds, the notification bar is hidden by setting _isNotificationVisible to false.
