# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_weather_bg_null_safety

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_weather_bg_null_safety` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_weather_bg_null_safety: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Open the `Podfile` and uncomment the platform line, setting it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that the package is set up, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `RealFlutter` class to display a weather background.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_weather_bg_null_safety/flutter_weather_bg_null_safety.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: WeatherBackground(
          weatherCondition: WeatherCondition.sunny, // Change this based on your weather data
          child: Center(
            child: Text(
              'Sunny Day!',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 40, color: Colors.white),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays a sunny weather background with a text overlay. You can change the `weatherCondition` property to reflect different weather states.

## Conclusion

You have now successfully set up and used the `flutter_weather_bg_null_safety` package in your Flutter application. This package allows you to create dynamic and visually appealing weather backgrounds that enhance the user experience.

# Complete Example of flutter_weather_bg_null_safety

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_weather_bg_null_safety/flutter_weather_bg_null_safety.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Weather Background Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        body: WeatherBackground(
          // Set the weather condition dynamically based on your weather data
          weatherCondition: WeatherCondition.sunny, // Example condition
          child: Center(
            child: Text(
              'Sunny Day!',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 40, color: Colors.white),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The runApp function takes the RealFlutter widget and starts the app.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title.
// 4. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold widget is created to provide the basic structure.
// 5. The WeatherBackground widget is used to display a dynamic background based on the weather condition.
// 6. The weatherCondition property is set to WeatherCondition.sunny, which will display a sunny background.
// 7. A Center widget is used to center the text "Sunny Day!" on the screen.
// 8. The text is styled with a large font size and white color for visibility against the background.
