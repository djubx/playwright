# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Appinio Social Share

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `appinio_social_share` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  appinio_social_share: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/appinio_social_share).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that you have the following permissions in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

2. Ensure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to share images.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to save images to your photo library.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to share text and images.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:appinio_social_share/appinio_social_share.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Social Share Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Share text and image
              AppinioSocialShare.share(
                text: 'Check out this amazing app!',
                imagePath: 'path_to_your_image.png', // Provide a valid image path
                url: 'https://example.com',
              );
            },
            child: Text('Share'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, it will trigger the sharing functionality, allowing users to share the specified text, image, and URL.
