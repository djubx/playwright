  altive_lints: ^1.0.0
```

### Step 2: Configure the Lint Rules

Create a new file called `analysis_options.yaml` in the root of the project and add the following configuration:

```yml
include: package:altive_lints/analysis_options.yaml

```dart
// Import the altive_lints package
import 'package:altive_lints/altive_lints.dart';

// Define the main class
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  // Define the build method
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a new Scaffold
    return Scaffold(
      // Set the app bar
      appBar: AppBar(
        // Set the title
        title: Text('Altive Lints Example'),
      ),
      // Set the body
      body: Center(
        // Create a new Text widget
        child: Text('Hello, World!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Define the main function
void main() {
  // Run the app
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// The following comments explain the flow of the application:

// 1. The app starts by importing the altive_lints package.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is defined, which extends the StatelessWidget class.
// 3. The build method is defined, which returns a new Scaffold widget.
// 4. The Scaffold widget is configured with an app bar and a body.
// 5. The app bar is set with a title.
// 6. The body is set with a Center widget, which contains a Text widget.
// 7. The Text widget displays the text 'Hello, World!'.
// 8. The main function is defined, which runs the app.
// 9. The app is run using the runApp function.

// Final summary: The code flows by defining a main class, creating a new Scaffold, and setting the app bar and body. The body contains a Text widget that displays the text 'Hello, World!'. The app is run using the runApp function.
