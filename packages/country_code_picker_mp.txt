## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add the following permissions in your `Info.plist` if you plan to access the user's location or contacts:

```xml

<string>We need your location to provide country code suggestions.</string>
<key>NSContactsUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your contacts to help you select country codes.</string>
```

## Using the Package
To use the `country_code_picker_mp` package, you can create a simple widget that utilizes the country code picker. Below is a basic example of how to implement it in your Flutter application.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:country_code_picker_mp/country_code_picker_mp.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Country Code Picker Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: CountryCodePicker(
            onChanged: (countryCode) {
              print("Selected country code: ${countryCode.dialCode}");
            },
            initialSelection: 'US',
            showCountryOnly: false,
            showOnlyCountryWhenClosed: false,
            favorite: ['+1', 'US', '+44', 'GB'],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays a country code picker. The selected country code is printed to the console when changed.

# Complete Example of `country_code_picker_mp`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:country_code_picker_mp/country_code_picker_mp.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Country Code Picker Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: CountryCodePicker(
            // Callback function that gets called when the user selects a country code
            onChanged: (countryCode) {
              // Print the selected country code to the console
              print("Selected country code: ${countryCode.dialCode}");
            },
            // Set the initial selection to the United States
            initialSelection: 'US',
            // Show only country names in the dropdown
            showCountryOnly: false,
            // Show country names and codes when the dropdown is open
            showOnlyCountryWhenClosed: false,
            // List of favorite country codes to show at the top
            favorite: ['+1', 'US', '+44', 'GB'],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  // Run the RealFlutter application
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, a CountryCodePicker is created.
// 4. The onChanged callback is triggered whenever the user selects a country code, printing the selected code to the console.
// 5. The initial selection is set to 'US', and the favorite country codes are specified to appear at the top of the list.
