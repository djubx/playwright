# Complete Example of river_player

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:river_player/river_player.dart';
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';

// Main function to run the app
void main() {
  runApp(ProviderScope(child: MyApp()));
}

// MyApp widget that serves as the root of the application
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'River Player Example',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

// RealFlutter widget that contains the audio player UI
class RealFlutter extends ConsumerWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    // Create an instance of the audio player
    final player = ref.watch(riverPlayerProvider);

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('River Player Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the current playback status
            Text(player.isPlaying ? 'Playing' : 'Paused'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Play button
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                player.play('https://www.example.com/audio.mp3'); // Replace with your audio URL
              },
              child: Text('Play'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 10),
            // Pause button
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                player.pause();
              },
              child: Text('Pause'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 10),
            // Stop button
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                player.stop();
              },
              child: Text('Stop'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The app starts with the main function, which initializes the ProviderScope and runs MyApp.
2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home widget as RealFlutter.
3. In RealFlutter, we use ConsumerWidget to access the Riverpod state.
4. We watch the riverPlayerProvider to get the current state of the audio player.
5. The UI displays the current playback status (Playing or Paused).
6. There are three buttons: Play, Pause, and Stop, each triggering the respective methods on the player instance.
7. When the Play button is pressed, it starts playing the audio from the specified URL.
8. The Pause and Stop buttons control the playback accordingly.
