# Setting Up `flutter_bdface_collect`

Integrating the `flutter_bdface_collect` package into your Flutter project involves several steps. Below is a detailed guide to help you set up and configure the package for both Android and iOS platforms.

## Installation

Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_bdface_collect: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Android Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Update your `AndroidManifest.xml` to include necessary permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

2. **SDK Setup**: Ensure that your project is using a minimum SDK version that supports camera and internet access. Update your `android/app/build.gradle`:

   ```gradle
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

## iOS Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file to request camera access:

   ```xml
   <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your camera for facial recognition.</string>
   ```

2. **Podfile**: Ensure your `ios/Podfile` is using platform version 10.0 or higher:

   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

## Using the Package

To use the package, import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_bdface_collect/flutter_bdface_collect.dart';
```

Initialize the `RealFlutter` class and configure it as needed for your application.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_bdface_collect/flutter_bdface_collect.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter BD Face Collect Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,

      home: FaceRecognitionScreen(),
    );
  }

    super.initState();

      await _realFlutter.initialize();
      print('Face recognition initialized successfully.');
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error initializing face recognition: $e');
    }
  }

  // Start the face recognition process
  void _startFaceRecognition() async {
    try {
      bool isRecognized = await _realFlutter.startRecognition();
      if (isRecognized) {
        print('Face recognized successfully.');
      } else {
        print('Face recognition failed.');
      }
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error during face recognition: $e');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Face Recognition'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _startFaceRecognition,
          child: Text('Start Face Recognition'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow:
// 1. The application starts with the `MyApp` widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The `FaceRecognitionScreen` is the home screen, where face recognition can be initiated.
// 3. In `initState`, the face recognition system is initialized using `_initializeFaceRecognition`.
// 4. The user can start the face recognition process by pressing the button, which calls `_startFaceRecognition`.
// 5. The result of the recognition process is printed to the console, indicating success or failure.
