# Overview of the "workout" Flutter Package

The "workout" Flutter package is a versatile tool designed to help developers create fitness and workout-related applications with ease. This package provides a comprehensive set of features that allow you to manage workout routines, track progress, and integrate various fitness functionalities into your app. 

## When to Use the "workout" Package

This package is ideal for developers looking to build applications that require:
- Customizable workout routines and schedules.
- Tracking of fitness metrics such as time, repetitions, and sets.
- Integration with health and fitness APIs for enhanced functionality.
- User-friendly interfaces for managing and viewing workout data.

## Key Features

- **Routine Management**: Easily create, edit, and delete workout routines.
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor user progress with detailed statistics and history.
- **Customizable Workouts**: Define exercises with specific parameters like duration, repetitions, and rest periods.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Seamlessly works on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Integration Capabilities**: Connect with external APIs for additional data and insights.

# Setting Up the "workout" Package in Your Flutter Project

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up the "workout" package in a Flutter project and demonstrate how to use its features effectively.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

First, add the "workout" package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  workout: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Setup

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure to enable Swift support by setting the `swift_version` in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
use_frameworks!
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:workout/workout.dart';
```

Initialize the main class `RealFlutter` and start using its methods to manage workouts.

## Step 4: Configuration and Optimization

- **Permissions**: Ensure that you request necessary permissions for accessing health data on both Android and iOS.
- **Performance**: Optimize data handling by using efficient state management solutions like Provider or Bloc.

            return ListView.builder(
              itemCount: routines.length,
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                return ListTile(

                    Navigator.push(

                      MaterialPageRoute(
                        builder: (context) => RoutineDetailPage(routine: routines[index]),
                      ),
                    );
                  },
                );
              },
            );
          }
        },
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          // Add a new workout routine
          workoutManager.addRoutine('New Routine', 30);
          setState(() {});
        },
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class RoutineDetailPage extends StatelessWidget {
  final Routine routine;

  RoutineDetailPage({required this.routine});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text(routine.name),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
          children: [
            Text('Routine Details', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold)),
            SizedBox(height: 10),
            Text('Duration: ${routine.duration} mins'),
            SizedBox(height: 10),
            Text('Exercises:'),
            ...routine.exercises.map((exercise) => Text('- ${exercise.name}')),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow:
// 1. The app starts with the `MyApp` widget, which sets up the MaterialApp and theme.
// 2. The `WorkoutHomePage` is the main screen, displaying a list of workout routines.
// 3. On initialization, `RealFlutter` is used to load existing routines.
// 4. The `FutureBuilder` widget handles asynchronous loading of routines.
// 5. Each routine is displayed in a ListTile, and tapping it navigates to `RoutineDetailPage`.
// 6. The `RoutineDetailPage` shows detailed information about the selected routine.
// 7. A FloatingActionButton allows users to add new routines, updating the list.
