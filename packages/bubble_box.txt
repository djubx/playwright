# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Bubble Box Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the Bubble Box package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  bubble_box: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Bubble Box

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a Bubble Box in your widget tree:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bubble_box/bubble_box.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Bubble Box Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: BubbleBox(
          color: Colors.blue,
          borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(15),
          shadow: BoxShadow(
            color: Colors.black26,
            blurRadius: 10,
            offset: Offset(0, 5),
          ),
          child: Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
            child: Text(
              'Hello, this is a bubble box!',
              style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 18),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code creates a simple Flutter application with a bubble box in the center of the screen.

# Complete Example of the Bubble Box Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bubble_box/bubble_box.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Bubble Box Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Bubble Box Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: BubbleBox(
          color: Colors.blue, // Set the background color of the bubble
          borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(15), // Rounded corners
          shadow: BoxShadow(
            color: Colors.black26, // Shadow color
            blurRadius: 10, // Blur radius for the shadow
            offset: Offset(0, 5), // Offset for the shadow
          ),
          child: Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0), // Padding inside the bubble
            child: Text(
              'Hello, this is a bubble box!', // Text content
              style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 18), // Text style
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to RealFlutter, which is the main screen.
// 4. RealFlutter builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a centered BubbleBox.
// 5. The BubbleBox is styled with a blue background, rounded corners, and a shadow.
// 6. Inside the BubbleBox, there is a Padding widget that contains a Text widget displaying a message.
// 7. The application is responsive and will adapt to different screen sizes.
```
