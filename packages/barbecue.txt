# Barbecue Flutter Package

The **Barbecue** package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers, designed to simplify the process of creating and managing complex animations and transitions in mobile applications. It provides a set of utilities that allow developers to create smooth, visually appealing animations with minimal effort.

## When to Use Barbecue

You should consider using the Barbecue package when:
- You want to enhance the user experience with animations that are easy to implement.
- You need to create custom transitions between screens or widgets.
- You are looking for a way to manage animations in a more organized manner.

## Features

- **Ease of Use**: The package is designed to be intuitive, allowing developers to implement animations without deep knowledge of Flutter's animation framework.
- **Custom Animations**: Create custom animations tailored to your application's needs.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Built with performance in mind, ensuring smooth animations even on lower-end devices.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

In summary, the Barbecue package is an excellent choice for Flutter developers looking to add sophisticated animations to their applications with ease.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Barbecue Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the Barbecue package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  barbecue: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # Ensure this is set to at least 10.0
```

## Step 3: Using the Barbecue Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a basic animation using the Barbecue package.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:barbecue/barbecue.dart';
```

2. Create a simple widget that uses the Barbecue animations.

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Barbecue Animation Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: BarbecueAnimation(
          duration: Duration(seconds: 2),
          child: FlutterLogo(size: 100),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates a simple animation of a Flutter logo that fades in over two seconds.

# Complete Example of Using the Barbecue Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:barbecue/barbecue.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Barbecue Example',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Barbecue Animation Example')),
      body: Center(
        // Using BarbecueAnimation to animate the Flutter logo
        child: BarbecueAnimation(
          duration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Animation duration
          child: FlutterLogo(size: 100), // Widget to animate
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme, and specifies RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a BarbecueAnimation is created, which wraps a Flutter logo.
// 5. The BarbecueAnimation takes a duration of 2 seconds, meaning the logo will fade in smoothly over this time.
// 6. When the app runs, the Flutter logo will appear with a fade-in effect, demonstrating the use of the Barbecue package for animations.
```
