# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Cart Stepper Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **cart_stepper** package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cart_stepper: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:cart_stepper/cart_stepper.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Cart Stepper Widget

You can now use the `CartStepper` widget in your application. Below is a basic example of how to implement it:

```dart
CartStepper(
  initialValue: 1, // Starting quantity
  minValue: 1,     // Minimum quantity
  maxValue: 10,    // Maximum quantity
  onChanged: (value) {
    // Handle the quantity change
    print('Quantity changed to: $value');
  },
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

#### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Customizing the Cart Stepper

You can customize the appearance of the `CartStepper` by using various properties such as `color`, `textStyle`, and more. Hereâ€™s an example:

```dart
CartStepper(
  initialValue: 1,
  minValue: 1,
  maxValue: 10,
  color: Colors.blue,
  textStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, color: Colors.white),
  onChanged: (value) {
    print('Quantity changed to: $value');
  },
)
```

This customization allows you to create a stepper that fits seamlessly into your app's design.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the **cart_stepper** package into your Flutter application effectively.

# Complete Example of Using the Cart Stepper Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cart_stepper/cart_stepper.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Cart Stepper Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Cart Stepper Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: CartStepperExample(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class CartStepperExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CartStepperExampleState createState() => _CartStepperExampleState();
}

class _CartStepperExampleState extends State<CartStepperExample> {
  int _quantity = 1; // Initialize quantity

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        // Display the current quantity
        Text(
          'Quantity: $_quantity',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20),
        // CartStepper widget to manage quantity
        CartStepper(
          initialValue: _quantity,
          minValue: 1,
          maxValue: 10,
          onChanged: (value) {
            // Update the quantity when changed
            setState(() {
              _quantity = value;
            });
          },
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp and Scaffold.
// 3. The CartStepperExample widget is displayed in the center of the screen.
// 4. CartStepperExample is a StatefulWidget that maintains the current quantity state.
// 5. The quantity is displayed in a Text widget.
// 6. The CartStepper widget allows users to change the quantity.
// 7. When the quantity changes, the onChanged callback updates the state, which triggers a rebuild to reflect the new quantity.
