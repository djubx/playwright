# Timer Button Flutter Package

The `timer_button` Flutter package is a versatile and easy-to-use widget that allows developers to create buttons with a countdown timer feature. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to limit user actions, such as in quiz applications, form submissions, or any interactive UI where timing is crucial.

## When to Use

You might consider using the `timer_button` package in the following scenarios:
- **Quiz Applications**: To limit the time a user has to answer a question.
- **Form Submissions**: To prevent users from submitting forms multiple times in quick succession.
- **Game Development**: To create countdowns for game actions or turns.

## Features

- **Customizable Timer**: You can set the duration of the countdown and customize the appearance of the button.
- **State Management**: The package handles the state of the timer, making it easy to integrate into your Flutter app.
- **Callbacks**: You can define actions to be taken when the timer completes or when the button is pressed.

Overall, the `timer_button` package enhances user experience by providing a clear visual indication of time constraints, making it a valuable addition to any Flutter application.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Timer Button Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `timer_button` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  timer_button: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Timer Button

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using the `TimerButton` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:timer_button/timer_button.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Timer Button Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: TimerButton(
            label: Text('Start Timer'),
            onPressed: () {
              // Action to perform when the button is pressed
              print('Timer started!');
            },
            timeOut: Duration(seconds: 10), // Set the countdown duration
            onTimeout: () {
              // Action to perform when the timer completes
              print('Timer completed!');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `TimerButton` widget is used to create a button that starts a countdown when pressed. The `onPressed` callback is triggered when the button is pressed, and the `onTimeout` callback is executed when the timer completes.

# Complete Example of Timer Button in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:timer_button/timer_button.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Timer Button Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: TimerButton(
            label: Text('Start Timer'), // Label displayed on the button
            onPressed: () {
              // Action to perform when the button is pressed
              print('Timer started!'); // Log message indicating timer start
            },
            timeOut: Duration(seconds: 10), // Set the countdown duration to 10 seconds
            onTimeout: () {
              // Action to perform when the timer completes
              print('Timer completed!'); // Log message indicating timer completion
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter class builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a TimerButton is created.
// 5. When the button is pressed, it starts a 10-second countdown.
// 6. During the countdown, the button is disabled, and the label changes to show the remaining time.
// 7. Once the countdown completes, the onTimeout callback is triggered, logging 'Timer completed!' to the console.
