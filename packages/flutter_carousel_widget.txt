# Setting Up and Using the Flutter Carousel Widget

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_carousel_widget` package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_carousel_widget` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_carousel_widget: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configurations

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Carousel Widget

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using the `Carousel` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_carousel_widget/flutter_carousel_widget.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Carousel Widget Example')),
        body: Carousel(
          items: [
            Image.network('https://example.com/image1.jpg'),
            Image.network('https://example.com/image2.jpg'),
            Image.network('https://example.com/image3.jpg'),
          ],
          options: CarouselOptions(
            height: 400,
            autoPlay: true,
            autoPlayInterval: Duration(seconds: 3),
            enlargeCenterPage: true,
            enableInfiniteScroll: true,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple carousel that displays three images. The `CarouselOptions` allows us to customize the behavior of the carousel, such as enabling auto-play and infinite scrolling.

# Complete Example of Flutter Carousel Widget

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_carousel_widget/flutter_carousel_widget.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Carousel Widget Example')),
        body: Carousel(
          items: [
            // Adding the first image to the carousel
            Image.network('https://example.com/image1.jpg'),
            // Adding the second image to the carousel
            Image.network('https://example.com/image2.jpg'),
            // Adding the third image to the carousel
            Image.network('https://example.com/image3.jpg'),
          ],
          options: CarouselOptions(
            height: 400, // Setting the height of the carousel
            autoPlay: true, // Enabling auto-play feature
            autoPlayInterval: Duration(seconds: 3), // Duration between auto-plays
            enlargeCenterPage: true, // Enlarge the center page
            enableInfiniteScroll: true, // Enable infinite scrolling
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the RealFlutter app
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Carousel.
// 3. The Carousel widget displays three images fetched from the network.
// 4. The CarouselOptions allow customization, such as auto-playing the carousel every 3 seconds and enabling infinite scrolling.
// 5. The enlargeCenterPage option makes the currently active image larger, enhancing the visual appeal.
