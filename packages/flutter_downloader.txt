# Flutter Downloader Package

The `flutter_downloader` package is a powerful tool for managing file downloads in Flutter applications. It provides a simple and efficient way to download files in the background, allowing users to continue using the app while downloads are in progress. This package is particularly useful for applications that require downloading large files, such as media files, documents, or any other type of data that may take time to download.

## When to Use `flutter_downloader`

You should consider using the `flutter_downloader` package in scenarios such as:
- Downloading large files without blocking the UI.
- Supporting background downloads that can continue even when the app is not in the foreground.
- Providing users with download progress updates and notifications.
- Managing multiple downloads simultaneously.

## Key Features
- **Background Downloads**: Supports downloading files in the background, even when the app is closed.
- **Download Progress**: Provides real-time updates on download progress.
- **Notifications**: Sends notifications to inform users about the download status.
- **Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS with platform-specific configurations.

Overall, the `flutter_downloader` package is an essential tool for any Flutter developer looking to implement robust file downloading capabilities in their applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `flutter_downloader`

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_downloader` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_downloader` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_downloader: ^1.7.1
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open `AndroidManifest.xml` located in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
   ```

2. **Service Declaration**: Also in `AndroidManifest.xml`, add the following service declaration inside the `<application>` tag:

   ```xml
   <service android:name="vn.hunghd.flutterdownloader.DownloadService" android:permission="android.permission.BIND_JOB_SERVICE" android:exported="true"/>
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open `Info.plist` located in `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys:

   ```xml
   <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your photo library to save downloaded files.</string>
   <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your microphone to record audio.</string>
   ```

2. **Background Modes**: Enable background modes in your Xcode project:
   - Open your project in Xcode.
   - Select the project in the navigator, then select the target.
   - Go to the "Capabilities" tab and enable "Background Modes".
   - Check "Background fetch" and "Remote notifications".

## Step 3: Initialize the Package

In your main Dart file, initialize the `flutter_downloader` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_downloader/flutter_downloader.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await FlutterDownloader.initialize(debug: true); // Initialize the plugin
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the `flutter_downloader` package to start downloading files. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to start a download and listen for its progress.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_downloader/flutter_downloader.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _taskId;
  String _progress = '0%';

  void _startDownload() async {
    final taskId = await FlutterDownloader.enqueue(
      url: 'https://example.com/file.zip', // Replace with your file URL
      savedDir: '/storage/emulated/0/Download', // Change to your desired directory
      showNotification: true, // Show notification when the download starts
      openFileFromNotification: true, // Open file when the notification is tapped
    );
    setState(() {
      _taskId = taskId;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Downloader Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Download Progress: $_progress'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _startDownload,
              child: Text('Start Download'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple UI with a button to start the download and a text widget to display the download progress.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we covered the setup and usage of the `flutter_downloader` package. We added the necessary dependencies, configured platform-specific settings, and demonstrated how to start a download. You can now integrate this package into your Flutter applications to manage file downloads effectively.

# Complete Example of Using `flutter_downloader`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_downloader/flutter_downloader.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await FlutterDownloader.initialize(debug: true); // Initialize the downloader
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _taskId; // Variable to hold the task ID of the download
  String _progress = '0%'; // Variable to hold the download progress

  // Method to start the download
  void _startDownload() async {
    final taskId = await FlutterDownloader.enqueue(
      url: 'https://example.com/file.zip', // URL of the file to download
      savedDir: '/storage/emulated/0/Download', // Directory to save the downloaded file
      showNotification: true, // Show notification when the download starts
      openFileFromNotification: true, // Open file when the notification is tapped
    );
    setState(() {
      _taskId = taskId; // Update the task ID
    });
  }

  // Method to update the download progress
  void _updateProgress() async {
    // Listen for download progress updates
    FlutterDownloader.registerCallback((id, status, progress) {
      if (id == _taskId) {
        setState(() {
          _progress = '$progress%'; // Update the progress variable
        });
      }
    });
  }

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _updateProgress(); // Start listening for progress updates
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Downloader Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Download Progress: $_progress'), // Display the download progress
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _startDownload, // Start download on button press
              child: Text('Start Download'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app initializes the FlutterDownloader in the main method.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which contains the UI for downloading files.
// 3. When the "Start Download" button is pressed, the _startDownload method is called.
// 4. This method enqueues a download task with the specified URL and directory.
// 5. The app listens for progress updates using the _updateProgress method.
// 6. As the download progresses, the progress variable is updated, and the UI reflects the current download status.
