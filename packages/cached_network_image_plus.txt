- You want to provide a better user experience by displaying placeholder images while the actual images are loading.

## Key Features
- **Caching**: Automatically caches images for offline access.
- **Placeholders**: Allows you to display a placeholder image while the actual image is loading.
- **Error Handling**: Provides options to display an error widget if the image fails to load.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Cached Network Image Plus

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `cached_network_image_plus` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cached_network_image_plus: ^2.0.0
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to access the internet. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following line inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to ensure that your app has permission to access the internet. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use `cached_network_image_plus` to display an image.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cached_network_image_plus/cached_network_image_plus.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Cached Network Image Plus Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: CachedNetworkImage(
            imageUrl: 'https://example.com/image.jpg',
            placeholder: (context, url) => CircularProgressIndicator(),
            errorWidget: (context, url, error) => Icon(Icons.error),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example:
- We import the necessary packages.
- We create a `RealFlutter` class that extends `StatelessWidget`.
- Inside the `build` method, we use `CachedNetworkImage` to load an image from a URL, display a loading indicator while the image is loading, and show an error icon if the image fails to load.

With these steps, you can easily integrate `cached_network_image_plus` into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example: A Fully Functional Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cached_network_image_plus/cached_network_image_plus.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Cached Network Image Plus Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: CachedNetworkImage(
            imageUrl: 'https://example.com/image.jpg', // URL of the image to load
            placeholder: (context, url) => CircularProgressIndicator(), // Placeholder while loading
            errorWidget: (context, url, error) => Icon(Icons.error), // Error widget if loading fails
            fit: BoxFit.cover, // Fit the image to cover the widget
            alignment: Alignment.center, // Center the image
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the app
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which calls runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Cached Network Image Plus Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a CachedNetworkImage widget.
// 5. The CachedNetworkImage widget attempts to load an image from the specified URL.
// 6. While the image is loading, a CircularProgressIndicator is displayed as a placeholder.
// 7. If the image fails to load, an error icon is displayed.
// 8. The image is set to fit the widget using BoxFit.cover and is aligned to the center.
```
