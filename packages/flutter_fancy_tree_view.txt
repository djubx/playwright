# flutter_fancy_tree_view: A Comprehensive Overview

The `flutter_fancy_tree_view` package is a powerful Flutter library designed to create tree view structures in your applications. This package is particularly useful for displaying hierarchical data, such as file systems, organizational charts, or any data that can be represented in a tree format. 

## When to Use This Package
You might consider using `flutter_fancy_tree_view` in scenarios such as:

- Visualizing hierarchical data like categories and subcategories in an e-commerce app.

## Key Features
- **Customizable Nodes**: You can customize the appearance of each node in the tree.
- **Expandable and Collapsible**: Nodes can be expanded or collapsed, allowing for a cleaner UI.
- **Dynamic Data Handling**: Easily manage and update the tree structure with dynamic data.

# flutter_fancy_tree_view: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the `flutter_fancy_tree_view` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_fancy_tree_view: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # Ensure this is set to at least 10.0
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_fancy_tree_view/flutter_fancy_tree_view.dart';
```

## Step 4: Basic Usage
You can now use the `FancyTreeView` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Fancy Tree View Example')),
      body: FancyTreeView(
        nodes: [
          TreeNode(
            label: 'Root Node',
            children: [
              TreeNode(label: 'Child Node 1'),
              TreeNode(label: 'Child Node 2', children: [
                TreeNode(label: 'Grandchild Node 1'),
              ]),
            ],
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code creates a simple tree view with a root node and two child nodes, one of which has a grandchild.

# Complete Example of flutter_fancy_tree_view

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_fancy_tree_view/flutter_fancy_tree_view.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Fancy Tree View',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Fancy Tree View Example')),
      body: FancyTreeView(
        nodes: [
          // Root node
          TreeNode(
            label: 'Root Node',
            children: [
              // First child node
              TreeNode(label: 'Child Node 1'),
              // Second child node with a grandchild
              TreeNode(label: 'Child Node 2', children: [
                TreeNode(label: 'Grandchild Node 1'),
              ]),
            ],
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body containing a FancyTreeView.
// 4. The FancyTreeView is populated with a root node and its children, demonstrating a simple tree structure.
// 5. The tree view allows users to expand and collapse nodes, providing an interactive experience.
