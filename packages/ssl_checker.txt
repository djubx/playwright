# SSL Checker Flutter Package

The `ssl_checker` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that allows you to easily check the SSL certificate status of a given URL. This package is particularly useful for applications that require secure connections, such as e-commerce platforms, banking apps, or any service that handles sensitive user data. By ensuring that the SSL certificate is valid and up-to-date, developers can enhance the security and trustworthiness of their applications.

## When to Use This Package
- **Web Applications**: When you need to verify the SSL status of a web service your app interacts with.
- **Security Audits**: For applications that require regular checks on the SSL certificates of their APIs.
- **User Notifications**: To inform users about the security status of the websites they are accessing through your app.

## Features
- **Certificate Validation**: Checks if the SSL certificate is valid, expired, or revoked.
- **Detailed Information**: Provides detailed information about the SSL certificate, including issuer, validity period, and more.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that can be easily integrated into any Flutter application.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the SSL Checker Package

## Installation
To use the `ssl_checker` package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  ssl_checker: ^0.1.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `Info.plist` to allow arbitrary loads (if necessary):

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Using the Package
Once the package is installed and configured, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to check the SSL status of a URL.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ssl_checker/ssl_checker.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('SSL Checker Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Replace with the URL you want to check
              String url = 'https://example.com';
              try {
                // Check the SSL certificate
                SslStatus status = await SslChecker.check(url);
                // Display the result
                showDialog(
                  context: context,
                  builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                    title: Text('SSL Status'),
                    content: Text('The SSL status for $url is: ${status.toString()}'),
                    actions: [
                      TextButton(
                        onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                        child: Text('OK'),
                      ),
                    ],
                  ),
                );
              } catch (e) {
                // Handle any errors
                print('Error checking SSL: $e');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Check SSL Status'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of SSL Checker in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ssl_checker/ssl_checker.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('SSL Checker Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Define the URL to check
              String url = 'https://example.com';
              try {
                // Call the SSL Checker to validate the SSL certificate
                SslStatus status = await SslChecker.check(url);
                // Show the SSL status in a dialog
                showDialog(
                  context: context,
                  builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                    title: Text('SSL Status'),
                    content: Text('The SSL status for $url is: ${status.toString()}'),
                    actions: [
                      TextButton(
                        onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                        child: Text('OK'),
                      ),
                    ],
                  ),
                );
              } catch (e) {
                // Print error message if SSL check fails
                print('Error checking SSL: $e');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Check SSL Status'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

```
// The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a simple UI.
// It contains a button that, when pressed, checks the SSL status of a specified URL.
// The URL is hardcoded as 'https://example.com' for demonstration purposes.
// When the button is pressed, the app calls the SslChecker.check method to validate the SSL certificate.
// If the check is successful, it displays the SSL status in an AlertDialog.
// If an error occurs during the SSL check, it prints the error message to the console.
// This simple application effectively demonstrates how to use the ssl_checker package to validate SSL certificates in Flutter.
