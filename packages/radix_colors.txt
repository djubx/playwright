# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Radix Colors

## Installation
To get started with the **radix_colors** package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  radix_colors: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Usage
Once the package is installed, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s how to set it up:

1. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:radix_colors/radix_colors.dart';
```

2. **Using Colors**: You can access the colors directly from the `RadixColors` class. For example:

```dart
Color myColor = RadixColors.red; // Accessing the red color
```

### Platform-Specific Details
- **Android**: No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your Flutter environment is set up correctly.
- **iOS**: Similarly, no specific configurations are needed for iOS. The package works out of the box.

### Optimizations
- Consider using the colors in conjunction with Flutter's `ThemeData` to maintain a consistent look and feel across your app.
- Use the color shades provided by the package to create hover effects or different states for your UI components.

With these steps, you are now ready to implement the **radix_colors** package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Radix Colors in a Flutter App

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:radix_colors/radix_colors.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Radix Colors Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primaryColor: RadixColors.blue, // Setting primary color from radix_colors
        accentColor: RadixColors.green, // Setting accent color
      ),
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Radix Colors Demo'),
          backgroundColor: RadixColors.red, // Using red color for AppBar
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text(
                'Hello, Radix Colors!',
                style: TextStyle(
                  color: RadixColors.purple, // Using purple color for text
                  fontSize: 24,
                ),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Action when button is pressed
                },
                style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
                  primary: RadixColors.orange, // Using orange color for button
                ),
                child: Text('Press Me'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The main function initializes the app and runs the RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget builds the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// The theme uses colors from the radix_colors package for primary and accent colors.
// The home property of the MaterialApp is a Scaffold widget that provides a structure for the app.
// The AppBar uses the red color from the radix_colors package.
// The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child widgets.
// Inside the Center widget, a Column widget is used to arrange the text and button vertically.
// The Text widget displays a greeting message using the purple color from the radix_colors package.
// An ElevatedButton is created with an orange background color from the radix_colors package.
// The button currently has an empty onPressed function, which can be filled with desired functionality.

```

In summary, this example demonstrates how to effectively use the **radix_colors** package in a Flutter application. The app showcases a simple UI with an AppBar, a greeting message, and a button, all styled using colors from the **radix_colors** package. This approach not only enhances the visual appeal of the app but also ensures consistency in color usage throughout the application.
