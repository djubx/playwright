# Complete Example of Sliding Panel Pro

Here is a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the **sliding_panel_pro** package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sliding_panel_pro/sliding_panel_pro.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sliding Panel Pro Example',
      home: SlidingPanelExample(),
    );
  }
}

class SlidingPanelExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SlidingPanelExampleState createState() => _SlidingPanelExampleState();
}

class _SlidingPanelExampleState extends State<SlidingPanelExample> {
  // Create a controller for the sliding panel
  final PanelController _panelController = PanelController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Sliding Panel Pro Example'),
      ),
      body: Stack(
        children: [
          // Main content of the app
          Center(
            child: ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Open the sliding panel when the button is pressed
                _panelController.open();
              },
              child: Text('Open Sliding Panel'),
            ),
          ),
          // Sliding panel widget
          SlidingPanel(
            controller: _panelController,
            panel: Container(
              color: Colors.blueAccent,
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'This is the sliding panel!',
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24),
                ),
              ),
            ),
            // Main content behind the panel
            body: Container(
              color: Colors.grey[200],
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'Main Content',
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and home set to SlidingPanelExample.
// 3. SlidingPanelExample is a StatefulWidget that manages the state of the sliding panel.
// 4. A PanelController is created to control the sliding panel's open and close actions.
// 5. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Stack containing the main content and the sliding panel.
// 6. When the button is pressed, the sliding panel opens, revealing its content.
// 7. The sliding panel contains a simple text widget, while the body shows the main content behind it.
