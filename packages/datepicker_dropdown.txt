# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Datepicker Dropdown

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `datepicker_dropdown` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `datepicker_dropdown` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  datepicker_dropdown: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` file to allow for date formatting. Add the following key-value pair:

```xml
<key>NSCalendarsUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to the calendar for date selection.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Datepicker Dropdown

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is an example of how to implement the `datepicker_dropdown` in a simple Flutter app.

<!-- END_TUTORIAL -->

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:datepicker_dropdown/datepicker_dropdown.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Datepicker Dropdown Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Datepicker Dropdown Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: DatePickerDropdown(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DatePickerDropdown extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DatePickerDropdownState createState() => _DatePickerDropdownState();
}

class _DatePickerDropdownState extends State<DatePickerDropdown> {
  DateTime? selectedDate; // Variable to hold the selected date

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        // Display the selected date or a placeholder
        Text(
          selectedDate != null
              ? 'Selected Date: ${selectedDate!.toLocal()}'.split(' ')[0]
              : 'No Date Selected',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20),
        // DatePickerDropdown widget
        DatePickerDropdown(
          onChanged: (DateTime date) {
            setState(() {
              selectedDate = date; // Update the selected date
            });
          },
          // Optional: Customize the date format
          dateFormat: 'yyyy-MM-dd',
          // Optional: Set the initial date
          initialDate: DateTime.now(),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter class builds the main MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, we have an AppBar and a centered body containing the DatePickerDropdown widget.
// 4. The DatePickerDropdown widget is a stateful widget that manages the selected date.
// 5. When a date is selected from the dropdown, the onChanged callback updates the selectedDate variable.
// 6. The selected date is displayed above the dropdown, or a placeholder is shown if no date is selected.
```
