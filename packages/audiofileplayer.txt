## Tutorial

### Installation

To get started with the `audiofileplayer` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  audiofileplayer: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android
For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

#### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `Info.plist` to allow audio playback:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio playback.</string>
<key>NSAppleMusicUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your music library.</string>
```

### Basic Usage

To use the `audiofileplayer` package, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:audiofileplayer/audiofileplayer.dart';
```

2. Create an instance of `Audio` and load an audio file:

```dart
Audio audio = Audio.loadFromAsset('assets/audio/sample.mp3');
```

3. Control playback with methods like `play()`, `pause()`, and `stop()`:

```dart
audio.play();
```

4. Listen for playback state changes:

```dart
audio.onPlayerStateChanged.listen((state) {
  // Handle state changes
});
```

This setup will allow you to start integrating audio playback into your Flutter application seamlessly.

## Complete Example

Hereâ€™s a complete example of a Flutter application using the `audiofileplayer` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:audiofileplayer/audiofileplayer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late Audio audio; // Declare an Audio variable

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Load the audio file from assets
    audio = Audio.loadFromAsset('assets/audio/sample.mp3');
    
    // Listen for playback state changes
    audio.onPlayerStateChanged.listen((state) {
      // Update UI or handle state changes
      print('Playback state: $state');
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    audio.dispose(); // Dispose of the audio player when done
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Audio Player Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  audio.play(); // Play the audio
                },
                child: Text('Play'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  audio.pause(); // Pause the audio
                },
                child: Text('Pause'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  audio.stop(); // Stop the audio
                },
                child: Text('Stop'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget, we initialize the audio player in initState() by loading an audio file from assets.
// 3. We set up a listener for playback state changes to handle any updates.
// 4. The build method creates a simple UI with three buttons: Play, Pause, and Stop.
// 5. Each button triggers the corresponding audio control method when pressed.
// 6. Finally, we ensure to dispose of the audio player in the dispose method to free up resources.
```
