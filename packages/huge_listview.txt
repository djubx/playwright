```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21

# Complete Example of Huge ListView

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:huge_listview/huge_listview.dart'; // Import the huge_listview package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the main application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Huge ListView Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Huge ListView Demo'), // App bar title
        ),
        body: HugeListView.builder(
          itemCount: 10000, // Total number of items in the list
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            return ListTile(
              title: Text('Item $index'), // Display item index
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Huge ListView Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold uses HugeListView.builder to create a list of 10,000 items.
// 5. The itemBuilder function generates a ListTile for each item, displaying its index.
// 6. As the user scrolls, the HugeListView efficiently loads and displays only the visible items, ensuring smooth performance.
```
