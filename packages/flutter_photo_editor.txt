# Setting Up the Flutter Photo Editor Package

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_photo_editor` package and explain how to use it effectively.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_photo_editor` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_photo_editor: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_photo_editor).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    compileSdkVersion 31 // or latest
    ...
}

dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:28.0.0' // or latest
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `ios/Podfile`.
2. Ensure that you have the platform set to at least iOS 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

3. Run `pod install` in the `ios` directory to install the necessary dependencies.

## Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_photo_editor/flutter_photo_editor.dart';
```

## Step 4: Basic Usage

To use the `flutter_photo_editor`, you can create a simple interface that allows users to select an image and edit it. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to implement it:

```dart
// Inside your widget
void _editPhoto(String imagePath) async {
  final editedImage = await Navigator.push(
    context,
    MaterialPageRoute(
      builder: (context) => PhotoEditor(
        image: File(imagePath),
      ),
    ),
  );

  // Use the edited image as needed
}
```

This function opens the photo editor when a user selects an image, allowing them to edit it and return the edited image.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and start using the `flutter_photo_editor` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using the Flutter Photo Editor

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_photo_editor/flutter_photo_editor.dart';
import 'dart:io';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Photo Editor Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: PhotoEditorHome(),
    );
  }
}

class PhotoEditorHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PhotoEditorHomeState createState() => _PhotoEditorHomeState();
}

class _PhotoEditorHomeState extends State<PhotoEditorHome> {
  File? _image; // Variable to hold the selected image

  // Function to pick an image from the gallery
  Future<void> _pickImage() async {
    // Code to pick an image from the gallery
    // For example, using image_picker package
    // final pickedFile = await ImagePicker().getImage(source: ImageSource.gallery);
    // setState(() {
    //   _image = File(pickedFile.path);
    // });
  }

  // Function to edit the selected image
  void _editPhoto() async {
    if (_image != null) {
      final editedImage = await Navigator.push(
        context,
        MaterialPageRoute(
          builder: (context) => PhotoEditor(
            image: _image!,
          ),
        ),
      );

      // Update the state with the edited image
      if (editedImage != null) {
        setState(() {
          _image = editedImage;
        });
      }
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Photo Editor Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            _image == null
                ? Text('No image selected.')
                : Image.file(_image!), // Display the selected image
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _pickImage, // Button to pick an image
              child: Text('Pick Image'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _editPhoto, // Button to edit the image
              child: Text('Edit Image'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home as PhotoEditorHome.
// 3. In PhotoEditorHome, the user can pick an image from the gallery.
// 4. Once an image is selected, it is displayed on the screen.
// 5. The user can then click the "Edit Image" button to open the photo editor.
// 6. After editing, the edited image is returned and displayed in the app.
```
