# Setting Up the remedi_kopo Package

To get started with the `remedi_kopo` package, follow these steps:

## Installation

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     remedi_kopo: ^latest_version
   ```

   Replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

2. **Install Packages**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
- Ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the correct permissions and dependencies. You may need to add internet permissions if your app requires network access for payment processing:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21 // or higher
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS
- For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` file to allow network requests. Add the following lines:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

## Usage

Once the package is installed and configured, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initialize and use the `remedi_kopo` package to create a payment interface.

# Complete Example of Using remedi_kopo

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:remedi_kopo/remedi_kopo.dart'; // Import the remedi_kopo package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the main application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Remedi Kopo Example',
      home: PaymentScreen(), // Set the home screen to PaymentScreen
    );
  }
}

class PaymentScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PaymentScreenState createState() => _PaymentScreenState();
}

class _PaymentScreenState extends State<PaymentScreen> {
  // Initialize the payment controller
  final RemediKopoController _controller = RemediKopoController();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the payment controller
    _controller.initialize();
  }

  void _makePayment() async {
    // Call the payment method
    try {
      final result = await _controller.processPayment(
        amount: 100.0, // Set the payment amount
        currency: 'USD', // Set the currency
      );
      // Handle the payment result
      if (result.success) {
        // Payment was successful
        ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
          SnackBar(content: Text('Payment Successful!')),
        );
      } else {
        // Payment failed
        ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
          SnackBar(content: Text('Payment Failed: ${result.error}')),
        );
      }
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors during payment processing
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Error: $e')),
      );
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Payment Screen'), // Title of the app bar
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _makePayment, // Trigger payment on button press
          child: Text('Make Payment'), // Button text
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (PaymentScreen).
// 3. PaymentScreen initializes the RemediKopoController in its state.
// 4. When the user presses the "Make Payment" button, the _makePayment method is called.
// 5. The _makePayment method processes the payment and handles success or failure.
// 6. Feedback is provided to the user via SnackBars based on the payment result.
