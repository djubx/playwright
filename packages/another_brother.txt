# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the "another_brother" Package

## Installation
To get started with the `another_brother` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  another_brother: ^1.0.0
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file to access the photo library:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to edit images.</string>
```

## Using the Package
Once the package is installed and configured, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to use the `another_brother` package to apply a filter to an image.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:another_brother/another_brother.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Another Brother Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Load an image from assets
              final image = await loadImage('assets/sample.jpg');
              
              // Apply a filter to the image
              final filteredImage = await applyFilter(image, FilterType.sepia);
              
              // Display the filtered image
              showDialog(
                context: context,
                builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                  content: Image.memory(filteredImage),
                ),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Apply Filter'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we load an image, apply a sepia filter, and display the result in a dialog. The `loadImage` and `applyFilter` functions are part of the `another_brother` package, which simplifies image manipulation tasks.

              // Load an image from assets
              final image = await loadImage('assets/sample.jpg');
              
              // Apply a filter to the image
              final filteredImage = await applyFilter(image, FilterType.sepia);
              
              // Display the filtered image
              showDialog(
                context: context,
                builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                  content: Image.memory(filteredImage),
                ),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Apply Filter'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which builds a MaterialApp.
// 2. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. The Center widget contains an ElevatedButton that, when pressed, triggers an asynchronous function.
// 4. This function loads an image from the assets using the loadImage method provided by the another_brother package.
// 5. After loading the image, it applies a sepia filter using the applyFilter method.
// 6. Finally, it displays the filtered image in a dialog box using the showDialog method.
// 7. The user can see the result of the image manipulation in a simple and interactive way.
