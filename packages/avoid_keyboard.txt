Here's a detailed technical blog on the "avoid_keyboard" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Avoid Keyboard Flutter Package

The **avoid_keyboard** package is a Flutter library designed to enhance user experience by managing the keyboard's visibility and behavior in mobile applications. It provides a simple way to avoid the keyboard overlapping input fields, ensuring that users can see what they are typing without any obstruction.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the **avoid_keyboard** package in scenarios such as:

- **Forms**: When building forms where users need to input text, the keyboard can often obscure the fields, making it difficult for users to see what they are typing.
- **Chat Applications**: In chat apps, when the keyboard appears, it can cover the message input field, leading to a frustrating user experience.
- **Data Entry Applications**: Any application that requires extensive data entry can benefit from this package to ensure that the keyboard does not interfere with the user's ability to see the input fields.

## Features

- **Automatic Adjustment**: The package automatically adjusts the layout when the keyboard appears, ensuring that input fields remain visible.
- **Customizable Behavior**: Developers can customize how the layout behaves when the keyboard is shown or hidden.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

By integrating the **avoid_keyboard** package, developers can significantly improve the usability of their applications, leading to a better overall user experience.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Avoid Keyboard Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **avoid_keyboard** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  avoid_keyboard: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the appropriate settings. You may need to adjust the `windowSoftInputMode` to `adjustResize` to allow the layout to resize when the keyboard appears. This can be done by adding the following line within the `<activity>` tag:

```xml
<activity
    android:name=".MainActivity"
    android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize">
```

### iOS

For iOS, no additional configuration is typically required. The package should work out of the box. However, ensure that your app's deployment target is set to a version that supports the necessary features.

## Step 3: Using the Package

To use the **avoid_keyboard** package, wrap your main widget with the `AvoidKeyboard` widget. This widget will manage the keyboard's visibility and adjust the layout accordingly.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:avoid_keyboard/avoid_keyboard.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: AvoidKeyboard(
        child: Scaffold(
          appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Avoid Keyboard Example')),
          body: Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
            child: Column(
              children: [
                TextField(
                  decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter your name'),
                ),
                SizedBox(height: 20),
                TextField(
                  decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter your message'),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, the `AvoidKeyboard` widget wraps the `Scaffold`, ensuring that when the keyboard appears, the layout adjusts to keep the text fields visible.

# Complete Example of Avoid Keyboard Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:avoid_keyboard/avoid_keyboard.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: AvoidKeyboard(
        child: Scaffold(
          appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Avoid Keyboard Example')),
          body: Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
            child: Column(
              children: [
                // TextField for user to enter their name
                TextField(
                  decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter your name'),
                ),
                SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between text fields
                // TextField for user to enter a message
                TextField(
                  decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter your message'),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a home property set to an AvoidKeyboard widget.
// 3. The AvoidKeyboard widget wraps a Scaffold, which provides the basic visual structure of the app.
// 4. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'Avoid Keyboard Example'.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains a Padding widget to add space around the content.
// 6. A Column widget is used to arrange two TextFields vertically.
// 7. The first TextField allows the user to enter their name, while the second TextField is for entering a message.
// 8. When the keyboard appears, the AvoidKeyboard widget ensures that the TextFields remain visible, enhancing user experience.
