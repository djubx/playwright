```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_product_card/flutter_product_card.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Product Card Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Product Card Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ProductCard(
            // Product image URL
            image: 'https://example.com/product-image.jpg',
            
            // Product title
            title: 'Product Title',
            
            // Product price
            price: 19.99,
            
            // Button press handler
            onPressed: () {
              // Handle button press
              print('Button pressed!');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the application.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` widget is created and displayed.
// 3. The `ProductCard` widget is created and displayed within the `RealFlutter` widget.
// 4. The user can view the product image, title, and price within the `ProductCard` widget.
// 5. The user can press the button within the `ProductCard` widget to trigger the button press handler.
// 6. The button press handler prints a message to the console indicating that the button was pressed.

// In summary, this code creates a simple Flutter application that displays a product card with a customizable image, title, price, and button.
// The user can view the product information and press the button to trigger a custom action.
