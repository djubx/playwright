## Basic Usage
Hereâ€™s how to implement the `ios_search_appbar` in your Flutter application:

1. Import the package:
   ```dart
   import 'package:ios_search_appbar/ios_search_appbar.dart';
   ```

2. Use the `IosSearchAppBar` widget in your app:
   ```dart
   class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return Scaffold(
         appBar: AppBar(
           title: Text('Search Example'),
           bottom: PreferredSize(
             preferredSize: Size.fromHeight(56.0),
             child: IosSearchAppBar(
               onSearch: (query) {
                 // Handle search query
               },
             ),
           ),
         ),
         body: Center(child: Text('Search for something!')),
       );
     }
   }
   ```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application with an iOS-style search bar integrated into the AppBar.

# Complete Example of Using the iOS Search AppBar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ios_search_appbar/ios_search_appbar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'iOS Search AppBar Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Search Example'),
          // Adding the iOS Search AppBar to the AppBar
          bottom: PreferredSize(
            preferredSize: Size.fromHeight(56.0),
            child: IosSearchAppBar(
              // Callback function to handle search queries
              onSearch: (query) {
                // Here you can implement your search logic
                print('Search query: $query');
              },
            ),
          ),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Search for something!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to a Scaffold widget.
// 4. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with a title and a bottom section.
// 5. The bottom section of the AppBar is a PreferredSize widget that holds the IosSearchAppBar.
// 6. The IosSearchAppBar has an onSearch callback that prints the search query to the console.
// 7. The body of the Scaffold contains a centered text widget prompting the user to search.
