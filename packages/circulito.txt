Here's a detailed technical blog on the "circulito" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Circulito Flutter Package

The **Circulito** package is a powerful Flutter library designed to create circular progress indicators with customizable features. It allows developers to enhance the user experience by providing visually appealing loading indicators that can be easily integrated into any Flutter application.

## When to Use Circulito

You might consider using the Circulito package in scenarios such as:
- **Loading States**: When fetching data from an API, you can use Circulito to indicate that the application is processing.
- **Task Completion**: To show the progress of long-running tasks, such as file uploads or downloads.
- **User Feedback**: Providing visual feedback during user interactions, such as form submissions.

## Features

- **Customizable Appearance**: You can easily change colors, sizes, and animation speeds to match your app's theme.
- **Multiple Styles**: Supports different styles of circular indicators, allowing for a unique look and feel.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that makes it easy to add to your existing Flutter projects.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Circulito

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with Circulito, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  circulito: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using Circulito in Your Application

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement Circulito in your app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:circulito/circulito.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Circulito Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Circulito Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: RealFlutter(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Circulito(
      size: 100.0, // Size of the circular indicator
      strokeWidth: 8.0, // Width of the circular line
      color: Colors.blue, // Color of the circular indicator
      backgroundColor: Colors.grey[200], // Background color
      value: 0.7, // Progress value (0.0 to 1.0)
      animationDuration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Animation duration
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays a circular progress indicator using the Circulito package.

# Complete Example of Circulito

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:circulito/circulito.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// MyApp is the main widget that sets up the MaterialApp
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Circulito Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Circulito Demo'), // Title of the app bar
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: RealFlutter(), // Centering the RealFlutter widget
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that displays the Circulito indicator
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Circulito(
      size: 100.0, // Setting the size of the circular indicator
      strokeWidth: 8.0, // Setting the width of the circular line
      color: Colors.blue, // Setting the color of the circular indicator
      backgroundColor: Colors.grey[200], // Setting the background color
      value: 0.7, // Setting the progress value (70% completed)
      animationDuration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Duration of the animation
    );
  }
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Circulito Demo".
4. The body of the Scaffold centers the RealFlutter widget.
5. RealFlutter builds a Circulito widget with specified properties:
   - Size: 100.0
   - Stroke Width: 8.0
   - Color: Blue
   - Background Color: Light Grey
   - Value: 0.7 (indicating 70% progress)
   - Animation Duration: 2 seconds
6. The Circulito widget displays a circular progress indicator reflecting the specified properties.
