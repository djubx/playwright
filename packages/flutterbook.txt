# Flutterbook Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the flutterbook package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutterbook: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file, especially if you are accessing external content or files.

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to display images in the book.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the flutterbook package, you can create a simple book reader widget. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutterbook/flutterbook.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutterbook Example',
      home: BookReader(
        book: Book(
          title: 'Sample Book',
          chapters: [
            Chapter(title: 'Chapter 1', content: 'This is the content of chapter 1.'),
            Chapter(title: 'Chapter 2', content: 'This is the content of chapter 2.'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application that uses the flutterbook package to display a book with two chapters.

# Complete Example of Flutterbook

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutterbook/flutterbook.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutterbook Example',
      home: BookReader(
        book: Book(
          title: 'Sample Book',
          chapters: [
            Chapter(title: 'Chapter 1', content: 'This is the content of chapter 1.'),
            Chapter(title: 'Chapter 2', content: 'This is the content of chapter 2.'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The main function initializes the app and runs the RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title.
// Inside the MaterialApp, we create a BookReader widget that takes a Book object.
// The Book object contains a title and a list of Chapter objects.
// Each Chapter has a title and content, which will be displayed in the BookReader.
// This setup allows users to read through the chapters of the book seamlessly.
```

// The application flow is straightforward:
// 1. The `main` function is the entry point of the app, calling `runApp` with the `RealFlutter` widget.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` widget builds a `MaterialApp`, which is the main structure of the Flutter app.
// 3. Inside the `MaterialApp`, we create a `BookReader` widget, which is responsible for displaying the book content.
// 4. The `BookReader` takes a `Book` object that contains the title and a list of `Chapter` objects.
// 5. Each `Chapter` has a title and content, which the `BookReader` will render for the user.
// 6. Users can navigate through the chapters, providing a smooth reading experience.
