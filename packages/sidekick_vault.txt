# Exploring the `sidekick_vault` Flutter Package

The `sidekick_vault` package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who need to securely store sensitive data, such as API keys, user credentials, or any other confidential information. This package provides a simple and effective way to manage secure storage across both Android and iOS platforms.

## When to Use `sidekick_vault`
You should consider using `sidekick_vault` in scenarios where:
- You need to store sensitive user information securely.
- You want to manage API keys or tokens without exposing them in your codebase.
- You require a cross-platform solution that works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.

## Key Features
- **Secure Storage**: Utilizes platform-specific secure storage mechanisms (Keychain for iOS and Keystore for Android).
- **Easy API**: Simple and intuitive API for storing and retrieving data.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS without additional configuration.
- **Data Encryption**: Automatically encrypts data before storage, ensuring that sensitive information is protected.

# Setting Up and Using the `sidekick_vault` Package

## Installation
To get started with `sidekick_vault`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  sidekick_vault: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/sidekick_vault).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following permissions:
   ```xml
   <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your photo library to save images.</string>
   ```

## Basic Usage
Hereâ€™s how to use the `sidekick_vault` package in your Flutter application:

1. Import the package:
   ```dart
   import 'package:sidekick_vault/sidekick_vault.dart';
   ```

2. Initialize the vault:
   ```dart
   final vault = SidekickVault();
   ```

3. Store data securely:
   ```dart
   await vault.store('api_key', 'your_api_key_here');
   ```

4. Retrieve data:
   ```dart
   String? apiKey = await vault.retrieve('api_key');
   ```

5. Delete data:
   ```dart
   await vault.delete('api_key');
   ```

With these steps, you can easily manage sensitive data in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Using `sidekick_vault`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sidekick_vault/sidekick_vault.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sidekick Vault Example',
      home: VaultExample(),
    );
  }
}

class VaultExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _VaultExampleState createState() => _VaultExampleState();
}

class _VaultExampleState extends State<VaultExample> {
  final SidekickVault vault = SidekickVault(); // Initialize the vault
  String? _apiKey; // Variable to hold the retrieved API key

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _loadApiKey(); // Load the API key when the widget is initialized
  }

  // Function to load the API key from the vault
  Future<void> _loadApiKey() async {
    String? apiKey = await vault.retrieve('api_key'); // Retrieve the API key
    setState(() {
      _apiKey = apiKey; // Update the state with the retrieved API key
    });
  }

  // Function to store a new API key
  Future<void> _storeApiKey(String apiKey) async {
    await vault.store('api_key', apiKey); // Store the API key in the vault
    _loadApiKey(); // Reload the API key to update the UI
  }

  // Function to delete the API key
  Future<void> _deleteApiKey() async {
    await vault.delete('api_key'); // Delete the API key from the vault
    _loadApiKey(); // Reload the API key to update the UI
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Sidekick Vault Example'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              onSubmitted: _storeApiKey, // Store the API key when submitted
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Enter API Key',
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text('Stored API Key: ${_apiKey ?? "None"}'), // Display the stored API key
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _deleteApiKey, // Delete the API key when pressed
              child: Text('Delete API Key'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```
// The application starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and home widget.
// The home widget is VaultExample, which is a StatefulWidget.
// In the _VaultExampleState, we initialize the SidekickVault instance.
// The initState method calls _loadApiKey to retrieve any stored API key when the widget is created.
// The _loadApiKey function retrieves the API key from the vault and updates the state.
// The build method creates a UI with a TextField for inputting the API key, 
// a Text widget to display the currently stored API key, and a button to delete the key.
// When the user submits the TextField, the _storeApiKey function is called to store the new API key.
// The delete button calls _deleteApiKey to remove the stored key from the vault.
