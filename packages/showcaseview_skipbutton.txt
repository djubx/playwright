# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using ShowcaseView SkipButton

## Installation
To add the `showcaseview_skipbutton` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  showcaseview_skipbutton: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/showcaseview_skipbutton).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` if your showcase views require specific features (like camera access). However, for basic usage, no additional configuration is necessary.

## Using the Package
To use the `showcaseview_skipbutton`, you need to wrap your widget with the `Showcase` widget provided by the package. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:showcaseview_skipbutton/showcaseview_skipbutton.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('ShowcaseView Example')),
        body: Showcase(
          key: GlobalKey(),
          description: 'This is a showcase view!',
          child: Center(child: Text('Hello, Flutter!')),
          skipButton: Text('Skip'), // Custom skip button
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with a showcase view that includes a skip button. The `Showcase` widget wraps around the widget you want to highlight, and you can customize the skip button as needed.

# Complete Example of ShowcaseView SkipButton

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:showcaseview_skipbutton/showcaseview_skipbutton.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('ShowcaseView Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Showcase(
            key: GlobalKey(), // Unique key for the showcase
            description: 'This is a showcase view!', // Description of the showcase
            child: ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action when the button is pressed
                print('Button Pressed!');
              },
              child: Text('Press Me'),
            ),
            skipButton: Text('Skip'), // Custom skip button
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, we have an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. The Center widget contains a Showcase widget that highlights the ElevatedButton.
// 5. The Showcase widget has a unique key, a description, and a skip button.
// 6. When the button is pressed, it prints 'Button Pressed!' to the console.
// 7. The skip button allows users to bypass the showcase view if they choose to.
