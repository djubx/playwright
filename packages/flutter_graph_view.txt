# Flutter Graph View Package

The `flutter_graph_view` package is a powerful tool for creating and visualizing graph structures in Flutter applications. It allows developers to represent complex data relationships in a visually appealing and interactive manner. This package is particularly useful for applications that require the representation of hierarchical data, such as organizational charts, family trees, or any other graph-based data structures.

## When to Use

You might consider using the `flutter_graph_view` package in scenarios such as:
- **Visualizing Hierarchical Data**: When you need to display data in a tree-like structure.
- **Interactive Graphs**: If your application requires user interaction with graph nodes, such as expanding or collapsing nodes.
- **Data Relationships**: To illustrate relationships between different entities in a clear and concise manner.

## Features

- **Customizable Nodes**: You can create custom widgets for nodes, allowing for a tailored appearance.
- **Interactive Graphs**: Users can interact with the graph, such as clicking on nodes to reveal more information.
- **Flexible Layouts**: Supports various layouts for displaying graphs, including tree and radial layouts.
- **Animations**: Provides smooth animations for transitions and interactions, enhancing user experience.

Overall, the `flutter_graph_view` package is an excellent choice for developers looking to implement graph visualizations in their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_graph_view

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_graph_view` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_graph_view` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_graph_view: ^0.5.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple graph view. We will create a basic application that displays a tree structure.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_graph_view/flutter_graph_view.dart';
```

2. Create a simple widget that uses the `GraphView` widget to display a graph.

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Graph View Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: GraphView(
          graph: _createGraph(),
          algorithm: BuchheimWalkerAlgorithm(
            builder: (Node node) {
              return _buildNode(node);
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  Graph _createGraph() {
    // Create a graph and add nodes and edges here
  }

  Widget _buildNode(Node node) {
    // Build a custom widget for each node
  }
}
```

3. Implement the `_createGraph` and `_buildNode` methods to define your graph structure and node appearance.

With these steps, you should have a basic setup for using the `flutter_graph_view` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of flutter_graph_view

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_graph_view/flutter_graph_view.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Graph View',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Graph View Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: GraphView(
          graph: _createGraph(), // Create the graph structure
          algorithm: BuchheimWalkerAlgorithm(
            builder: (Node node) {
              return _buildNode(node); // Build each node
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  Graph _createGraph() {
    // Create a new graph instance
    final graph = Graph();

    // Create nodes
    final node1 = Node.Id('1');
    final node2 = Node.Id('2');
    final node3 = Node.Id('3');

    // Add nodes to the graph
    graph.addNode(node1);
    graph.addNode(node2);
    graph.addNode(node3);

    // Create edges between nodes
    graph.addEdge(node1, node2);
    graph.addEdge(node1, node3);

    return graph; // Return the constructed graph
  }

  Widget _buildNode(Node node) {
    // Build a custom widget for each node
    return Card(
      color: Colors.blueAccent,
      child: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
        child: Text(
          node.id, // Display the node ID
          style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets MyApp as the home widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home screen.
// 3. RealFlutter creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a GraphView is created using the _createGraph method to define the graph structure.
// 5. The BuchheimWalkerAlgorithm is used to layout the graph, and _buildNode is called to create the visual representation of each node.
// 6. The _createGraph method constructs a graph with three nodes and edges connecting them.
// 7. The _buildNode method returns a Card widget for each node, displaying its ID.
