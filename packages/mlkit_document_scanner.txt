# mlkit_document_scanner Flutter Package

The `mlkit_document_scanner` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to integrate document scanning capabilities into their applications. Leveraging Google's ML Kit, this package allows for real-time document scanning, text recognition, and image processing, making it ideal for applications that require document management, data extraction, or digitization of physical documents.

## When to Use This Package
- **Document Management Apps**: If you're building an app that requires users to scan and manage documents, this package is a perfect fit.
- **Data Entry Applications**: For apps that need to extract text from physical documents, such as invoices or receipts, the `mlkit_document_scanner` can automate data entry.
- **Educational Tools**: Apps that help students digitize notes or textbooks can benefit from this package.

## Features
- **Real-time Document Scanning**: Capture documents in real-time with automatic detection and cropping.
- **Text Recognition**: Extract text from scanned documents using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
- **Image Processing**: Enhance scanned images for better readability and accuracy.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using mlkit_document_scanner

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `mlkit_document_scanner` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `mlkit_document_scanner` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  mlkit_document_scanner: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/mlkit_document_scanner).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version required
    }
}
```

2. Add the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following keys for camera usage:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the camera to scan documents.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the photo library to save scanned documents.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's implement it in our Flutter application. 

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:mlkit_document_scanner/mlkit_document_scanner.dart';
```

2. Create a simple UI to initiate document scanning:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mlkit_document_scanner/mlkit_document_scanner.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Document Scanner')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Start the document scanner
              final result = await MlkitDocumentScanner.scanDocument();
              // Handle the scanned document result
              if (result != null) {
                // Process the scanned document
                print('Scanned Document: ${result.text}');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Scan Document'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application with a button that, when pressed, initiates the document scanning process.

# Complete Example of mlkit_document_scanner

Here is a complete example of a Flutter application using the `mlkit_document_scanner` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mlkit_document_scanner/mlkit_document_scanner.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Document Scanner')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Start the document scanner
              final result = await MlkitDocumentScanner.scanDocument();
              // Handle the scanned document result
              if (result != null) {
                // Process the scanned document
                print('Scanned Document: ${result.text}');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Scan Document'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget with an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, it calls the scanDocument method from the mlkit_document_scanner package.
// 5. The scanDocument method opens the camera for scanning documents.
// 6. Once a document is scanned, the result is returned, and the extracted text is printed to the console.
