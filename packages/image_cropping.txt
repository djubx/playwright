# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Image Cropping Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `image_cropping` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  image_cropping: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/image_cropping).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    compileSdkVersion 31 // or latest
    ...
}
```

2. Ensure you have the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request permission for accessing the photo library:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to crop images.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to take photos.</string>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement image cropping.

# Complete Example of Image Cropping

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:image_cropping/image_cropping.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Image Cropping Example',
      home: ImageCropperScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ImageCropperScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ImageCropperScreenState createState() => _ImageCropperScreenState();
}

class _ImageCropperScreenState extends State<ImageCropperScreen> {
  // Variable to hold the cropped image
  CroppedFile? _croppedFile;

  // Function to pick and crop an image
  Future<void> _cropImage() async {
    // Open the image cropping interface
    final CroppedFile? croppedFile = await ImageCropping().cropImage(
      sourcePath: 'path_to_your_image', // Replace with your image path
      aspectRatioPresets: [
        CropAspectRatioPreset.square,
        CropAspectRatioPreset.original,
      ],
      androidUiSettings: AndroidUiSettings(
        toolbarTitle: 'Cropper',
        toolbarColor: Colors.deepOrange,
        toolbarWidgetColor: Colors.white,
        initAspectRatio: CropAspectRatioPreset.original,
        lockAspectRatio: false,
      ),
      iosUiSettings: IOSUiSettings(
        minimumAspectRatio: 1.0,
      ),
    );

    // Update the state with the cropped image
    if (croppedFile != null) {
      setState(() {
        _croppedFile = croppedFile;
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Image Cropping Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display the cropped image if available
            _croppedFile != null
                ? Image.file(File(_croppedFile!.path))
                : Text('No image selected.'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _cropImage,
              child: Text('Crop Image'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp and the home screen.
// 3. ImageCropperScreen is a StatefulWidget that manages the state of the cropped image.
// 4. The _cropImage function is called when the user presses the "Crop Image" button.
// 5. This function opens the image cropping interface, allowing the user to select and crop an image.
// 6. Once the image is cropped, it updates the state to display the cropped image on the screen.
```
