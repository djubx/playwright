# Setting Up and Using saropa_dart_utils

## Installation
To add the `saropa_dart_utils` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  saropa_dart_utils: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/saropa_dart_utils).

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
The `saropa_dart_utils` package is designed to work seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms. There are no additional platform-specific configurations required for basic usage. However, ensure that your Flutter environment is set up correctly for both platforms.

## Basic Usage
To use the package, import it into your Dart files:

```dart
import 'package:saropa_dart_utils/saropa_dart_utils.dart';
```

You can then access its utility functions directly. For example, to format a date:

```dart
String formattedDate = DateUtils.formatDate(DateTime.now());
```

This will give you a string representation of the current date in a predefined format.

### Example of Using String Utilities
```dart
String trimmedString = StringUtils.trim("   Hello, World!   ");
```

This will remove the leading and trailing spaces from the string.

By leveraging the `saropa_dart_utils` package, you can streamline your Flutter development process and focus on building features rather than utility functions.

# Complete Example of Using saropa_dart_utils

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:saropa_dart_utils/saropa_dart_utils.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Saropa Dart Utils Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Saropa Dart Utils Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying a formatted date
              Text(
                'Formatted Date: ${DateUtils.formatDate(DateTime.now())}',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Displaying a trimmed string
              Text(
                'Trimmed String: "${StringUtils.trim("   Hello, World!   ")}"',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Displaying a formatted number
              Text(
                'Formatted Number: ${NumberUtils.formatCurrency(12345.67)}',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that centers its child.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange multiple Text widgets vertically.
// 5. The first Text widget displays the current date formatted using DateUtils.formatDate().
// 6. The second Text widget shows a trimmed version of a string using StringUtils.trim().
// 7. The third Text widget displays a formatted currency value using NumberUtils.formatCurrency().
// 8. Each Text widget is styled with a font size of 20 for better visibility.
