# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Analytics Logger Gen

## Installation
To add the `analytics_logger_gen` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  analytics_logger_gen: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions and dependencies for logging. You may need to add internet permissions if you are sending logs to a remote server.

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add any required permissions for network access if you are logging events remotely.

## Basic Usage
To start using the package, you need to initialize the logger in your main application file. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:analytics_logger_gen/analytics_logger_gen.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the logger
  RealFlutter.initialize();
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Analytics Logger Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Log a button click event
            RealFlutter.logEvent('button_click', {'button_name': 'example_button'});
          },
          child: Text('Click Me'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize the logger and log a button click event when the button is pressed.

# Complete Example: A Functional Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:analytics_logger_gen/analytics_logger_gen.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the logger
  RealFlutter.initialize();
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Analytics Logger Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Analytics Logger Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Log a button click event
                RealFlutter.logEvent('button_click', {'button_name': 'example_button'});
              },
              child: Text('Click Me'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Log a screen view event
                RealFlutter.logEvent('screen_view', {'screen_name': 'HomeScreen'});
              },
              child: Text('View Screen'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the logger by calling RealFlutter.initialize().
// 2. The MyApp widget is created, which sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home screen.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is displayed, containing two buttons.
// 4. When the "Click Me" button is pressed, an event is logged indicating a button click with the name 'example_button'.
// 5. When the "View Screen" button is pressed, a screen view event is logged with the name 'HomeScreen'.
// 6. This allows developers to track user interactions and screen views effectively.
