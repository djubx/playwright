You can use the `DatePicker` widget in your application. Here’s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
DatePicker.showDatePicker(
  context,

## Complete Example

Here’s a complete example of a Flutter application using the `flutter_cupertino_datetime_picker` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_cupertino_datetime_picker/flutter_cupertino_datetime_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Cupertino DateTime Picker Example',
      home: DateTimePickerPage(),
    );
  }
}

class DateTimePickerPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DateTimePickerPageState createState() => _DateTimePickerPageState();
}

class _DateTimePickerPageState extends State<DateTimePickerPage> {
  DateTime selectedDate = DateTime.now(); // Variable to hold the selected date

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('DateTime Picker Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Selected Date: ${selectedDate.toLocal()}'.split(' ')[0], // Display the selected date
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Show the date picker when the button is pressed
                DatePicker.showDatePicker(
                  context,
                  showTitleActions: true,
                  onConfirm: (date) {
                    setState(() {
                      selectedDate = date; // Update the selected date
                    });
                  },
                  currentTime: selectedDate,
                  locale: LocaleType.en,
                );
              },
              child: Text('Pick a Date'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home page (DateTimePickerPage).
// 3. DateTimePickerPage is a StatefulWidget that maintains the selected date state.
// 4. The build method displays the selected date and a button to pick a new date.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the DatePicker is shown, allowing the user to select a date.
// 6. Upon confirming a date, the selected date is updated and displayed on the screen.
```
