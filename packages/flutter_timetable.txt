# Setting Up and Using the Flutter Timetable Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_timetable` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_timetable` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_timetable: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a timetable using the `flutter_timetable` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_timetable/flutter_timetable.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Timetable Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Timetable Example'),
        ),
        body: Timetable(
          // Define your timetable data here
          timetableData: [
            TimetableEvent(
              title: 'Math Class',
              startTime: DateTime(2024, 9, 11, 9, 0),
              endTime: DateTime(2024, 9, 11, 10, 0),
            ),
            TimetableEvent(
              title: 'Science Class',
              startTime: DateTime(2024, 9, 11, 10, 0),
              endTime: DateTime(2024, 9, 11, 11, 0),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays a timetable with two events: a Math class and a Science class.

# Complete Example of Using the Flutter Timetable Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_timetable/flutter_timetable.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Timetable Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Timetable Example'),
        ),
        body: Timetable(
          // Define your timetable data here
          timetableData: [
            TimetableEvent(
              title: 'Math Class',
              startTime: DateTime(2024, 9, 11, 9, 0), // Start time of the event
              endTime: DateTime(2024, 9, 11, 10, 0), // End time of the event
            ),
            TimetableEvent(
              title: 'Science Class',
              startTime: DateTime(2024, 9, 11, 10, 0), // Start time of the event
              endTime: DateTime(2024, 9, 11, 11, 0), // End time of the event
            ),
            TimetableEvent(
              title: 'History Class',
              startTime: DateTime(2024, 9, 11, 11, 0), // Start time of the event
              endTime: DateTime(2024, 9, 11, 12, 0), // End time of the event
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Timetable Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Timetable widget.
// 5. The Timetable widget is populated with a list of TimetableEvent objects, each representing a class with a title, start time, and end time.
// 6. The timetable will display the events in a structured format, allowing users to see their schedule at a glance.
```
