# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the `card_actions` Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `card_actions` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and include the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  card_actions: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a card with actions:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:card_actions/card_actions.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Card Actions Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: CardActions(
            child: Card(
              elevation: 4,
              child: Padding(
                padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
                child: Column(
                  mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,
                  children: [
                    Text('Card Title', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24)),
                    SizedBox(height: 10),
                    Text('This is a description of the card.'),
                  ],
                ),
              ),
            ),
            actions: [
              CardAction(
                label: 'Action 1',
                onPressed: () {
                  // Handle Action 1
                  print('Action 1 pressed');
                },
              ),
              CardAction(
                label: 'Action 2',
                onPressed: () {
                  // Handle Action 2
                  print('Action 2 pressed');
                },
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple card with two actions. When the user taps on either action, a message is printed to the console.

# Complete Example of Using the `card_actions` Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:card_actions/card_actions.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Card Actions Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: CardActions(
            child: Card(
              elevation: 4, // Sets the elevation of the card for shadow effect
              child: Padding(
                padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0), // Adds padding inside the card
                child: Column(
                  mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min, // Makes the column take minimum space
                  children: [
                    Text('Card Title', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24)), // Title of the card
                    SizedBox(height: 10), // Adds space between title and description
                    Text('This is a description of the card.'), // Description of the card
                  ],
                ),
              ),
            ),
            actions: [
              CardAction(
                label: 'Action 1', // Label for the first action
                onPressed: () {
                  // Handle Action 1
                  print('Action 1 pressed'); // Prints message to console
                },
              ),
              CardAction(
                label: 'Action 2', // Label for the second action
                onPressed: () {
                  // Handle Action 2
                  print('Action 2 pressed'); // Prints message to console
                },
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Runs the RealFlutter application
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation

// The application starts by running the `RealFlutter` class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// Inside the `build` method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Card Actions Example".
// The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a CardActions widget.
// Inside the CardActions, a Card is created with an elevation for shadow effect.
// The Card contains a Padding widget that adds space around its child.
// A Column is used to arrange the title and description vertically.
// Two CardAction buttons are defined, each with a label and an onPressed callback.
// When either action is pressed, a message is printed to the console, demonstrating the interactivity of the card.
// The application is simple yet effectively showcases the capabilities of the `card_actions` package.
