# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Gauge Chart Package

## Installation
To use the `gauge_chart` package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  gauge_chart: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter and the package:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `gauge_chart` package, you can create a simple gauge chart in your Flutter widget tree. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gauge_chart/gauge_chart.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Gauge Chart Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: GaugeChart(
          value: 75, // Current value
          minValue: 0, // Minimum value
          maxValue: 100, // Maximum value
          gaugeColor: Colors.blue, // Color of the gauge
          backgroundColor: Colors.grey[300], // Background color
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code creates a simple gauge chart that displays a value of 75 out of a maximum of 100.

# Complete Example of Gauge Chart in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gauge_chart/gauge_chart.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Gauge Chart Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Gauge Chart Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: GaugeChart(
          value: 75, // Current value to be displayed on the gauge
          minValue: 0, // Minimum value of the gauge
          maxValue: 100, // Maximum value of the gauge
          gaugeColor: Colors.blue, // Color of the gauge
          backgroundColor: Colors.grey[300], // Background color of the gauge
          // Optional: Add a label to the gauge
          label: 'Performance', // Label displayed on the gauge
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme, setting RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a GaugeChart is created with a value of 75, a minimum of 0, and a maximum of 100.
// 5. The gauge is styled with a blue color and a grey background, providing a clear visual representation of the performance metric.
// 6. The label 'Performance' is displayed on the gauge, giving context to the value shown.
