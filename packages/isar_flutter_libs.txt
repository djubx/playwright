# Setting Up and Using `isar_flutter_libs`

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `isar_flutter_libs` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding Dependencies

To get started, add the `isar_flutter_libs` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  isar_flutter_libs: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/isar_flutter_libs).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure that you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
}
```

2. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
defaultConfig {
    ...
    minSdkVersion 21
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `ios/Podfile` and ensure that you have the following line uncommented:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

2. Run `pod install` in the `ios` directory to install the necessary dependencies.

## Step 3: Initializing Isar

In your Flutter application, you need to initialize Isar before using it. This is typically done in the `main` function:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:isar/isar.dart';
import 'package:isar_flutter_libs/isar_flutter_libs.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  final isar = await Isar.open([YourSchema]);
  runApp(MyApp(isar: isar));
}
```

## Step 4: Using Isar in Your Application

You can now use Isar to perform CRUD operations. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create, read, update, and delete data:

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  final Isar isar;

  MyApp({required this.isar});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Isar Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Example of creating a new object
              final newItem = YourModel(name: 'Item 1');
              await isar.yourModels.put(newItem);

              // Example of reading objects
              final items = await isar.yourModels.where().findAll();
              print(items);
            },
            child: Text('Perform CRUD Operations'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, replace `YourSchema` and `YourModel` with your actual schema and model classes.

# Complete Example of Using `isar_flutter_libs`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:isar/isar.dart';
import 'package:isar_flutter_libs/isar_flutter_libs.dart';

// Define your model class
part 'model.g.dart';

@Collection()
class YourModel {
  Id id = Isar.autoIncrement; // Auto-incrementing ID
  late String name; // Field to store the name
}

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  // Initialize Isar with your schema
  final isar = await Isar.open([YourModelSchema]);
  runApp(MyApp(isar: isar));
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  final Isar isar;

  MyApp({required this.isar});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Isar Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Create a new item
              final newItem = YourModel()..name = 'Item 1';
              await isar.yourModels.put(newItem); // Save to database

              // Read all items
              final items = await isar.yourModels.where().findAll();
              print(items.map((item) => item.name)); // Print item names
            },
            child: Text('Perform CRUD Operations'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts and initializes Isar with the defined schema.
// 2. The main widget (MyApp) is built, which contains a button.
// 3. When the button is pressed, a new item is created and saved to the Isar database.
// 4. After saving, all items in the database are retrieved and printed to the console.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this complete example, we defined a simple Flutter application that uses the `isar_flutter_libs` package to perform basic CRUD operations. The application initializes the Isar database, creates a new item, and retrieves all items from the database when the button is pressed.

### Summary of Application Flow

- The app initializes the Isar database with the defined schema.
- A button in the UI allows users to perform CRUD operations.
- When the button is clicked, a new item is created and stored in the database.
- The app retrieves and prints all items from the database to the console.

This structured approach provides a clear understanding of how to set up and use the `isar_flutter_libs` package in a Flutter application.
