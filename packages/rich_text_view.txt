# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Rich Text View Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `rich_text_view` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  rich_text_view: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you plan to use links that require internet access. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement `RichTextView` in your widget tree:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:rich_text_view/rich_text_view.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Rich Text View Example')),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: RichTextView(
            text: """
              This is an example of rich text. You can have **bold** text, _italic_ text, and even [links](https://flutter.dev).
            """,
            linkStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.blue, decoration: TextDecoration.underline),
            onLinkTap: (url) {
              // Handle link tap
              print("Link tapped: $url");
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays rich text with bold, italic, and hyperlink styles. The `onLinkTap` callback allows you to handle link clicks.

# Complete Example of Rich Text View

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:rich_text_view/rich_text_view.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Rich Text View Example')),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: RichTextView(
            text: """
              This is an example of rich text. You can have **bold** text, _italic_ text, and even [links](https://flutter.dev).
            """,
            linkStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.blue, decoration: TextDecoration.underline),
            onLinkTap: (url) {
              // Handle link tap
              print("Link tapped: $url");
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the `RealFlutter` class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. Inside the `build` method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// 3. The AppBar displays the title "Rich Text View Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Padding widget to add some space around the content.
// 5. Inside the Padding, we use the `RichTextView` widget to display formatted text.
// 6. The text includes bold, italic, and a hyperlink to the Flutter website.
// 7. The `linkStyle` property customizes the appearance of the link.
// 8. The `onLinkTap` callback is triggered when the link is tapped, allowing us to handle the action (in this case, printing the URL).
// 9. This simple example demonstrates how to integrate rich text into a Flutter application effectively.
