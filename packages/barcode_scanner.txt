# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Barcode Scanner Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `barcode_scanner` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  barcode_scanner: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/barcode_scanner).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open `AndroidManifest.xml` located in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
   ```

2. **Minimum SDK Version**: Ensure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open `Info.plist` located in `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following key to request camera access:

   ```xml
   <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to the camera to scan barcodes.</string>
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to implement barcode scanning.

<!-- END_TUTORIAL -->

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:barcode_scanner/barcode_scanner.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Barcode Scanner Example',
      home: ScannerPage(),
    );
  }
}

class ScannerPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ScannerPageState createState() => _ScannerPageState();
}

class _ScannerPageState extends State<ScannerPage> {
  String barcodeResult = "Scan a barcode";

  // Function to initiate the barcode scanning process
  Future<void> scanBarcode() async {
    try {
      // Start the barcode scanner and wait for the result
      String result = await BarcodeScanner.scan();
      // Update the state with the scanned result
      setState(() {
        barcodeResult = result;
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during scanning
      setState(() {
        barcodeResult = "Error: $e";
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Barcode Scanner'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              barcodeResult,
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: scanBarcode, // Call the scan function on button press
              child: Text('Start Scanning'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and home set to ScannerPage.
// 3. ScannerPage is a stateful widget that maintains the state of the scanned barcode result.
// 4. The scanBarcode function is defined to handle the scanning process.
// 5. When the user presses the "Start Scanning" button, scanBarcode is called.
// 6. The BarcodeScanner.scan() method is invoked, which opens the camera for scanning.
// 7. If a barcode is successfully scanned, the result is displayed on the screen.
// 8. If an error occurs during scanning, the error message is displayed instead.
```
