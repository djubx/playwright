# Tutorial: Setting Up Freshchat SDK in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `freshchat_sdk` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `freshchat_sdk` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  freshchat_sdk: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions and metadata:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.yourapp">

    <application
        android:name=".MainApplication"
        android:label="Your App"
        android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher">
        
        <meta-data
            android:name="freshchat_app_id"
            android:value="YOUR_FRESCHAT_APP_ID" />
        <meta-data
            android:name="freshchat_app_key"
            android:value="YOUR_FRESCHAT_APP_KEY" />
        
        <!-- Other configurations -->
    </application>
</manifest>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following entries:

```xml
<key>freshchat_app_id</key>
<string>YOUR_FRESCHAT_APP_ID</string>
<key>freshchat_app_key</key>
<string>YOUR_FRESCHAT_APP_KEY</string>
```

2. **Enable Background Modes**: In Xcode, go to your project settings, select the "Capabilities" tab, and enable "Background Modes". Check "Remote notifications".

## Step 3: Initialize Freshchat

In your main Dart file, initialize Freshchat in the `main()` function:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:freshchat_sdk/freshchat_sdk.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  Freshchat.init("YOUR_FRESCHAT_APP_ID", "YOUR_FRESCHAT_APP_KEY");
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 4: Using Freshchat

You can now use Freshchat in your application. For example, you can open the chat window with a button click:

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () {
    Freshchat.showConversations();
  },
  child: Text('Chat with Us'),
)
```

With these steps, you have successfully set up the `freshchat_sdk` package in your Flutter application. You can now start engaging with your users through real-time messaging.

# Complete Example: Freshchat SDK in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:freshchat_sdk/freshchat_sdk.dart';

void main() {
  // Ensure Flutter bindings are initialized
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  
  // Initialize Freshchat with your app ID and key
  Freshchat.init("YOUR_FRESCHAT_APP_ID", "YOUR_FRESCHAT_APP_KEY");
  
  // Run the Flutter application
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Freshchat Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Freshchat Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Show the Freshchat conversation window when the button is pressed
            Freshchat.showConversations();
          },
          child: Text('Chat with Us'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app and Freshchat SDK.
// 2. The MyApp class sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The HomeScreen class builds the main screen with an AppBar and a button.
// 4. When the button is pressed, it calls Freshchat.showConversations() to open the chat interface.
// 5. Users can now interact with support agents in real-time through the Freshchat interface.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we have created a simple Flutter application that integrates the Freshchat SDK. The application initializes the SDK, sets up a basic UI with a button, and opens the Freshchat conversation window when the button is clicked. 

### Summary of Application Flow
- The application starts by initializing the Freshchat SDK with the provided app ID and key.
- The main screen displays a button that, when pressed, opens the Freshchat conversation interface.
- This allows users to engage with customer support seamlessly within the app.
