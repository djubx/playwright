# Tutorial

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `appcenter_sdk_flutter` package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `appcenter_sdk_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  appcenter_sdk_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/appcenter_sdk_flutter).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions and metadata:

   ```xml
   <manifest>
       <application>
           <meta-data
               android:name="appcenter.app_secret"
               android:value="YOUR_APP_SECRET" />
           <meta-data
               android:name="appcenter.analytics.enabled"
               android:value="true" />
           <meta-data
               android:name="appcenter.crashes.enabled"
               android:value="true" />
       </application>
   </manifest>
   ```

   Replace `YOUR_APP_SECRET` with your actual App Center app secret.

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure your `android/build.gradle` file includes the following:

   ```groovy
   buildscript {
       ext.kotlin_version = '1.5.31'
       repositories {
           google()
           mavenCentral()
       }
       dependencies {
           classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.0.2'
           classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:$kotlin_version"
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following entries:

   ```xml
   <key>AppCenterAppSecret</key>
   <string>YOUR_APP_SECRET</string>
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

   Again, replace `YOUR_APP_SECRET` with your actual App Center app secret.

2. **CocoaPods**: Ensure you have the latest version of CocoaPods installed and run:

   ```bash
   cd ios
   pod install
   ```

## Step 3: Initialize the SDK

In your main Dart file, initialize the App Center SDK:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:appcenter_sdk_flutter/appcenter_sdk_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize App Center SDK
  AppCenter.start("YOUR_APP_SECRET", [AppCenterAnalytics.id, AppCenterCrashes.id]);
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

Replace `YOUR_APP_SECRET` with your actual App Center app secret.

## Step 4: Using the SDK

You can now use the SDK features in your app. For example, to log an event:

```dart
AppCenterAnalytics.trackEvent("Event Name", {"key": "value"});
```

To report a crash:

```dart
try {
  // Code that may throw an exception
} catch (e) {
  AppCenterCrashes.trackException(e);
}
```

With these steps, you have successfully set up and configured the `appcenter_sdk_flutter` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:appcenter_sdk_flutter/appcenter_sdk_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize App Center SDK with your App Secret
  AppCenter.start("YOUR_APP_SECRET", [AppCenterAnalytics.id, AppCenterCrashes.id]);
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'App Center SDK Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('App Center SDK Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text('Press the button to log an event.'),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Log an event to App Center Analytics
                  AppCenterAnalytics.trackEvent("Button Pressed", {"button": "log_event"});
                },
                child: Text('Log Event'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Simulate a crash
                  throw Exception("This is a simulated crash!");
                },
                child: Text('Simulate Crash'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the App Center SDK with the provided App Secret.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which builds the main UI of the app.
// 3. The UI consists of a title and two buttons:
//    - The first button logs an event to App Center Analytics when pressed.
//    - The second button simulates a crash, which will be reported to App Center Crashes.
// 4. When the app runs, pressing the buttons will trigger the respective actions, allowing you to test the App Center functionalities.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this blog, we covered the `appcenter_sdk_flutter` package, detailing its features, setup process, and a complete example. The application flow is straightforward: initialize the SDK, create a simple UI with buttons to log events and simulate crashes, and observe how the App Center captures this data for analysis and reporting. This integration enhances your app's reliability and user engagement through effective monitoring and analytics.
