# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Open App File Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `open_app_file` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  open_app_file: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/open_app_file).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Ensure you have the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to request permission to access files:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to open files.</string>
<key>NSDocumentsUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your documents to open files.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to open a file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:open_app_file/open_app_file.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Open App File Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Specify the file path and type
              final filePath = '/path/to/your/file.pdf';
              final result = await OpenAppFile.open(filePath);
              
              // Check if the file was opened successfully
              if (result == null) {
                // Handle the error
                print('Could not open the file.');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Open PDF File'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, the app attempts to open a PDF file located at the specified path. If the file cannot be opened, an error message is printed to the console.

# Complete Example of Using Open App File

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:open_app_file/open_app_file.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Open App File Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Specify the file path and type
              final filePath = '/path/to/your/file.pdf'; // Path to the file to be opened
              final result = await OpenAppFile.open(filePath); // Attempt to open the file
              
              // Check if the file was opened successfully
              if (result == null) {
                // Handle the error if the file could not be opened
                print('Could not open the file.'); // Log error message
              }
            },
            child: Text('Open PDF File'), // Button text
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and displays a button labeled 'Open PDF File'.
// 2. When the button is pressed, the app attempts to open a PDF file located at the specified path.
// 3. The `OpenAppFile.open` method is called with the file path as an argument.
// 4. If the file is successfully opened in the appropriate application, the user can view it.
// 5. If the file cannot be opened (e.g., if the file does not exist or there is no app to handle it), an error message is printed to the console.
```

In summary, the `open_app_file` package provides a straightforward way to open files in their respective applications from a Flutter app. By following the setup and usage instructions outlined above, you can easily integrate this functionality into your own applications, enhancing the user experience and providing seamless file handling capabilities.
