For iOS, you may need to set the platform version in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `mj_image_slider`, you can create a simple widget as follows:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mj_image_slider/mj_image_slider.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Image Slider Example')),
      body: MJImageSlider(
        images: [
          'https://example.com/image1.jpg',
          'https://example.com/image2.jpg',
          'https://example.com/image3.jpg',
        ],
        autoSlide: true,
        slideInterval: Duration(seconds: 3),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple image slider that automatically slides through three images every three seconds.

# Complete Example of `mj_image_slider`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mj_image_slider/mj_image_slider.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Image Slider Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Image Slider Example')),
      body: MJImageSlider(
        images: [
          'https://example.com/image1.jpg', // First image URL
          'https://example.com/image2.jpg', // Second image URL
          'https://example.com/image3.jpg', // Third image URL
        ],
        autoSlide: true, // Enables automatic sliding
        slideInterval: Duration(seconds: 3), // Time interval for sliding
        indicator: true, // Shows indicator dots for images
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home widget.
// The RealFlutter widget builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body containing the MJImageSlider.
// The MJImageSlider takes a list of image URLs, enabling auto-slide and setting the interval to 3 seconds.
// The indicator property is set to true, which displays dots indicating the current image.
// This creates a simple yet effective image slider for showcasing images in the app.
