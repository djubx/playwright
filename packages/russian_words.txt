# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the `russian_words` Package

## Installation
To use the `russian_words` package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  russian_words: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No specific configurations are required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package
Once the package is installed, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to generate a random Russian word:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:russian_words/russian_words.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Russian Words Generator')),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(generateRandomRussianWord()),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we import the `russian_words` package and use the `generateRandomRussianWord()` function to display a random Russian word in the center of the screen.

# Complete Example of Using the `russian_words` Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:russian_words/russian_words.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Russian Words App',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: WordGeneratorScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class WordGeneratorScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _WordGeneratorScreenState createState() => _WordGeneratorScreenState();
}

class _WordGeneratorScreenState extends State<WordGeneratorScreen> {
  String _randomWord = '';

  // Function to generate a new random word
  void _generateWord() {
    setState(() {
      _randomWord = generateRandomRussianWord(); // Generate a random Russian word
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Random Russian Word Generator')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              _randomWord.isEmpty ? 'Press the button to generate a word' : _randomWord,
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _generateWord, // Call the function to generate a new word
              child: Text('Generate Word'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home screen is set to WordGeneratorScreen.
// 4. WordGeneratorScreen is a stateful widget that maintains the state of the random word.
// 5. The _generateWord function updates the state with a new random word when called.
// 6. The UI displays the current random word or a prompt to generate one.
// 7. When the button is pressed, _generateWord is called, and the UI updates with a new word.
