# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Star Rating Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the **star_rating** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  star_rating: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:star_rating/star_rating.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Star Rating Widget
You can now use the `StarRating` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
StarRating(
  rating: 3.5, // Current rating
  starCount: 5, // Total number of stars
  size: 30.0, // Size of each star
  color: Colors.yellow, // Color of filled stars
  borderColor: Colors.grey, // Color of unfilled stars
  onRatingChanged: (rating) {
    // Handle rating change
    print(rating);
  },
)
```

This widget will display a star rating system where users can select a rating, and the current rating will be displayed.

# Complete Example of Using the Star Rating Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:star_rating/star_rating.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Star Rating Example',
      home: RatingPage(),
    );
  }
}

class RatingPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RatingPageState createState() => _RatingPageState();
}

class _RatingPageState extends State<RatingPage> {
  double _rating = 3.0; // Initial rating

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Star Rating Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display the star rating widget
            StarRating(
              rating: _rating, // Current rating
              starCount: 5, // Total number of stars
              size: 40.0, // Size of each star
              color: Colors.yellow, // Color of filled stars
              borderColor: Colors.grey, // Color of unfilled stars
              onRatingChanged: (rating) {
                // Update the state with the new rating
                setState(() {
                  _rating = rating; // Update the rating
                });
                print("New rating: $_rating"); // Print the new rating
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Add some space
            Text(
              'Your rating: $_rating', // Display the current rating
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home page.
// 3. The RatingPage is a StatefulWidget that maintains the current rating state.
// 4. In the build method of RatingPage, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the StarRating widget and a Text widget vertically.
// 6. The StarRating widget displays the current rating and allows users to change it.
// 7. When the user selects a new rating, the onRatingChanged callback updates the state with the new rating and prints it.
// 8. The Text widget below the stars displays the current rating to the user.
```
