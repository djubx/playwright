# Setting Up and Using the Simply Mentions Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `simply_mentions` package and demonstrate how to integrate it into a Flutter application.

## Installation

To get started, add `simply_mentions` to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  simply_mentions: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Setup

### Android

No additional setup is required for Android. Ensure your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
minSdkVersion 21
```

### iOS

For iOS, ensure your `ios/Podfile` has platform set to at least 11.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '11.0'
```

## Basic Usage

To use the `simply_mentions` package, import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:simply_mentions/simply_mentions.dart';
```

### Implementing Mentions

Create a `RealFlutter` widget that uses the `SimplyMentions` widget to handle user mentions:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return SimplyMentions(
      onMention: (String mention) {
        // Handle the mention
        print('Mentioned: $mention');
      },
      mentionStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.blue),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example: Flutter Main File

Below is a complete example of a Flutter application using the `simply_mentions` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simply_mentions/simply_mentions.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Simply Mentions Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Simply Mentions Example'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            // SimplyMentions widget to handle mentions
            SimplyMentions(
              controller: _controller,
              onMention: (String mention) {
                // Handle the mention
                print('Mentioned: $mention');
              },
              mentionStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.blue),
              suggestionBuilder: (context, mention) {
                // Customize the suggestion list
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text(mention),
                );
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Display the current text with mentions
            Text(
              'Current Text: ${_controller.text}',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp and home screen.
// 3. RealFlutter is the home screen, implemented as a StatefulWidget to manage the text input state.
// 4. The SimplyMentions widget is used to capture and handle mentions within the text field.
// 5. The onMention callback is triggered whenever a mention is detected, printing the mention to the console.
// 6. The suggestionBuilder allows customization of the mention suggestions displayed to the user.
// 7. The current text, including mentions, is displayed below the input field for user feedback.
