# Setting Up and Using the round_spot Package

## Installation
To use the `round_spot` package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  round_spot: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `round_spot` package, you can wrap your widget with the `RoundSpot` widget. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:round_spot/round_spot.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Round Spot Example')),
      body: Stack(
        children: [
          // Your main content here
          Center(child: Text('Hello, Flutter!')),
          // Adding a round spot
          RoundSpot(
            radius: 50.0,
            color: Colors.blue.withOpacity(0.5),
            position: Offset(100, 100), // Position of the spot
            onTap: () {
              // Action on tap
              print('Spot tapped!');
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to create a simple application with a circular spot that can be tapped. You can customize the radius, color, and position of the spot as needed.

# Complete Example of round_spot in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:round_spot/round_spot.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Round Spot Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Round Spot Example')),
      body: Stack(
        children: [
          // Main content of the app
          Center(child: Text('Hello, Flutter!')),
          
          // Adding a round spot
          RoundSpot(
            radius: 50.0, // Set the radius of the circular spot
            color: Colors.blue.withOpacity(0.5), // Set the color with opacity
            position: Offset(100, 100), // Position the spot on the screen
            onTap: () {
              // Action to perform when the spot is tapped
              print('Spot tapped!'); // Log to console
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Stack for layering widgets.
// 4. The Center widget displays a simple text message in the middle of the screen.
// 5. The RoundSpot widget is added to the Stack, positioned at (100, 100) pixels.
// 6. When the RoundSpot is tapped, it triggers the onTap callback, logging 'Spot tapped!' to the console.
