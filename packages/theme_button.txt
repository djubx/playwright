# Theme Button Flutter Package

The **theme_button** Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to simplify the implementation of themed buttons in Flutter applications. It allows developers to create buttons that adapt their appearance based on the current theme, providing a consistent and visually appealing user interface.

- You want to reduce boilerplate code when creating themed buttons.

## Features

- **Automatic Theme Adaptation**: Buttons automatically change their styles based on the current theme.
- **Customizable Styles**: You can easily customize the button's appearance, including colors, shapes, and sizes.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Theme Button Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **theme_button** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  theme_button: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Configuring for Android and iOS

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    compileSdkVersion 31  // Use the latest stable version
    ...
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, make sure your `ios/Podfile` is set to use the latest platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '12.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 3: Using the Theme Button Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a themed button.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:theme_button/theme_button.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Theme Button Example',
      theme: ThemeData.light(), // Light theme
      darkTheme: ThemeData.dark(), // Dark theme
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Theme Button Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ThemeButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Action when button is pressed
              print('Button Pressed!');
            },
            child: Text('Press Me'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that uses the **theme_button** package to create a button that adapts to the current theme.

# Complete Example of Using the Theme Button Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:theme_button/theme_button.dart';

// Main class of the application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Theme Button Example', // Title of the app
      theme: ThemeData.light(), // Define light theme
      darkTheme: ThemeData.dark(), // Define dark theme
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Theme Button Example'), // App bar title
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ThemeButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Action when button is pressed
              print('Button Pressed!'); // Log button press
            },
            child: Text('Press Me'), // Button text
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the app
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main() function, which calls runApp().
// 2. The RealFlutter class is instantiated, which builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a light and dark theme, allowing for theme switching.
// 4. The Scaffold widget provides a structure for the app, including an AppBar and body.
// 5. In the body, a centered ThemeButton is created.
// 6. When the button is pressed, it triggers the onPressed callback, logging 'Button Pressed!' to the console.
```
