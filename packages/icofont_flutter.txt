# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using icofont_flutter

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `icofont_flutter` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  icofont_flutter: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:icofont_flutter/icofont_flutter.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using Icons in Your Application

You can now use the icons in your Flutter widgets. Here’s how to use an IcoFont icon:

```dart
Icon(IcoFontIcons.home, size: 30.0, color: Colors.blue);
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

#### iOS

For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 9.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
```

## Step 5: Customizing Icons

You can customize the icons by changing their size and color. Here’s an example:

```dart
Icon(
  IcoFontIcons.user,
  size: 50.0, // Set the size of the icon
  color: Colors.red, // Set the color of the icon
);
```

With these steps, you can easily integrate and customize IcoFont icons in your Flutter application.

              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              // Displaying a user icon
              Icon(
                IcoFontIcons.user,
                size: 50.0, // Setting the size of the icon
                color: Colors.red, // Setting the color of the icon
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              // Displaying a settings icon
              Icon(
                IcoFontIcons.settings,
                size: 50.0, // Setting the size of the icon
                color: Colors.green, // Setting the color of the icon
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'IcoFont Icons Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Column widget.
// 5. Inside the Column, three Icon widgets are displayed: home, user, and settings.
// 6. Each icon is customized with size and color, demonstrating how to use the icofont_flutter package effectively.
