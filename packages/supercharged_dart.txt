```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:supercharged_dart/supercharged_dart.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Supercharged Dart Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends SuperchargedDartWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a new reactive variable
    var counter = 0.reactive;

    // Use the reactive variable to update the UI
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Supercharged Dart Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'You have pushed the button this many times:',
            ),
            Text(
              '${counter.value}',
              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline4,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          // Update the reactive variable
          counter.value++;
        },
        tooltip: 'Increment',
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user presses the floating action button.
// 2. The `counter.value` is incremented.
// 3. The UI is updated to reflect the new value of `counter.value`.
// This is all done seamlessly and efficiently using the `supercharged_dart` package.

// Final summary: The code flows by first creating a reactive variable `counter`.
// This variable is then used to update the UI whenever its value changes.
// The `supercharged_dart` package takes care of all the underlying complexity,
// allowing for a simple and efficient development process.
