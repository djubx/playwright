// The Pendo SDK is initialized with the API key and app name.
// The RealFlutter widget is the root of the application.
// The RealFlutter widget contains three buttons: Track Event, Track Page, and Show Survey.
// When the Track Event button is pressed, the Pendo SDK tracks an event named 'My Event'.
// When the Track Page button is pressed, the Pendo SDK tracks a page named 'My Page'.
// When the Show Survey button is pressed, the Pendo SDK shows a survey named 'My Survey'.
// The survey is displayed using the Pendo SDK's built-in survey functionality.
// The user's responses to the survey are collected and sent to the Pendo server.
// The Pendo server analyzes the user's responses and provides insights into their behavior.
// The insights are displayed in the Pendo dashboard, where they can be used to inform product decisions.
