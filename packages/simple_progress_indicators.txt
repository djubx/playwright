# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Simple Progress Indicators

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `simple_progress_indicators` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  simple_progress_indicators: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a circular progress indicator.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simple_progress_indicators/simple_progress_indicators.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Simple Progress Indicators Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: CircularProgressIndicator(
            value: null, // Set to null for indeterminate progress
            strokeWidth: 8.0,
            backgroundColor: Colors.grey[200],
            valueColor: AlwaysStoppedAnimation<Color>(Colors.blue),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that displays a circular progress indicator in the center of the screen. You can customize the `strokeWidth`, `backgroundColor`, and `valueColor` to match your app's theme.

## Conclusion

With just a few steps, you can integrate the `simple_progress_indicators` package into your Flutter application. Customize the indicators to fit your design and enhance the user experience by providing visual feedback during loading processes.

# Complete Example of Simple Progress Indicators

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simple_progress_indicators/simple_progress_indicators.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  double _progress = 0.0; // Variable to track progress
  bool _isLoading = false; // Flag to indicate loading state

  // Function to simulate a long-running task
  void _simulateLoading() {
    setState(() {
      _isLoading = true; // Set loading state to true
      _progress = 0.0; // Reset progress
    });

    // Simulate a loading process
    Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1), () {
      for (int i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
        Future.delayed(Duration(milliseconds: 300 * i), () {
          setState(() {
            _progress += 0.1; // Increment progress
          });
          if (_progress >= 1.0) {
            setState(() {
              _isLoading = false; // Set loading state to false when done
            });
          }
        });
      }
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Simple Progress Indicators Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: _isLoading
              ? Column(
                  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
                  children: [
                    // Displaying the circular progress indicator
                    CircularProgressIndicator(
                      value: _progress, // Bind progress value
                      strokeWidth: 8.0,
                      backgroundColor: Colors.grey[200],
                      valueColor: AlwaysStoppedAnimation<Color>(Colors.blue),
                    ),
                    SizedBox(height: 20),
                    Text('${(_progress * 100).toStringAsFixed(0)}%'), // Display progress percentage
                  ],
                )
              : ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: _simulateLoading, // Start loading on button press
                  child: Text('Start Loading'),
                ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation

// The application starts with a button labeled "Start Loading".
// When the button is pressed, the `_simulateLoading` function is called.
// This function sets the `_isLoading` flag to true and resets the `_progress` variable to 0.0.
// A loop simulates a loading process by incrementing the `_progress` variable every 300 milliseconds.
// The `CircularProgressIndicator` widget displays the current progress, and the percentage is shown below it.
// Once the progress reaches 100%, the loading state is set to false, and the button reappears.
