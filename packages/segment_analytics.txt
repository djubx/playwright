# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Segment Analytics in Flutter

## Installation
To get started with the `segment_analytics` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  segment_analytics: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/segment_analytics).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure that you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the Segment Android SDK dependency in your `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.segment.analytics.android:analytics:4.+'
}
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Podfile` and ensure that you have the following:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0' # Ensure this is set to at least 10.0
```

2. Add the Segment iOS SDK dependency in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'Analytics', '~> 4.0'
```

3. Run `pod install` in the `ios` directory to install the dependencies.

## Basic Usage
To use the `segment_analytics` package, you need to initialize it in your main application file. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:segment_analytics/segment_analytics.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Initialize Segment with your write key
    SegmentAnalytics.init('YOUR_WRITE_KEY');

    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Segment Analytics Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Segment Analytics')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Track a button click event
            SegmentAnalytics.track('Button Clicked', properties: {
              'button_name': 'Demo Button',
            });
          },
          child: Text('Click Me'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize the Segment analytics with a write key and track a button click event.

# Complete Example of Segment Analytics in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:segment_analytics/segment_analytics.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Initialize Segment with your write key
    SegmentAnalytics.init('YOUR_WRITE_KEY');

    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Segment Analytics Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Segment Analytics')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Track a button click event
            SegmentAnalytics.track('Button Clicked', properties: {
              'button_name': 'Demo Button',
            });
          },
          child: Text('Click Me'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp initializes the Segment analytics with a write key.
// 3. The MaterialApp widget is created with a title and a home screen.
// 4. The HomeScreen widget displays a button in the center of the screen.
// 5. When the button is clicked, the app tracks the event 'Button Clicked' 
//    and sends the associated property 'button_name' to Segment.
// 6. This allows you to analyze user interactions and behaviors through Segment's dashboard.
