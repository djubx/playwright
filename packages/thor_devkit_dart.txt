# Overview of the thor_devkit_dart Flutter Package

The `thor_devkit_dart` package is a powerful toolkit designed for Flutter developers to streamline the development process, particularly when working with the Thor blockchain. This package provides a set of utilities and features that facilitate interaction with the Thor network, making it easier to build decentralized applications (dApps) on Flutter.

## When to Use This Package
You should consider using `thor_devkit_dart` when:
- You are developing a Flutter application that requires interaction with the Thor blockchain.
- You need to manage blockchain transactions, smart contracts, or wallet functionalities.
- You want to leverage the features of the Thor network in a user-friendly manner.

## Key Features
- **Blockchain Interaction**: Simplifies the process of sending transactions and interacting with smart contracts on the Thor blockchain.
- **Wallet Management**: Provides utilities for creating and managing wallets, including key generation and storage.
- **Event Listening**: Allows developers to listen for blockchain events and updates in real-time.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

The `thor_devkit_dart` package is an essential tool for developers looking to integrate Thor blockchain functionalities into their Flutter applications.

# Setup and Usage of thor_devkit_dart

## Installation
To add the `thor_devkit_dart` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  thor_devkit_dart: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/thor_devkit_dart).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions added to the `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following key to allow network requests:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `thor_devkit_dart` package, you will typically start by initializing the package and creating a wallet. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to do this:

```dart
import 'package:thor_devkit_dart/thor_devkit_dart.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the Thor SDK
  final thor = ThorDevKit();

  // Create a new wallet
  final wallet = thor.createWallet();
  print('Wallet Address: ${wallet.address}');
}
```

This code initializes the Thor SDK and creates a new wallet, printing the wallet address to the console.

# Complete Example of Using thor_devkit_dart

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:thor_devkit_dart/thor_devkit_dart.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Thor DevKit Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Thor DevKit Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: WalletWidget(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class WalletWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _WalletWidgetState createState() => _WalletWidgetState();
}

class _WalletWidgetState extends State<WalletWidget> {
  late ThorDevKit thor;
  late Wallet wallet;
  String? walletAddress;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the Thor SDK
    thor = ThorDevKit();
    // Create a new wallet
    wallet = thor.createWallet();
    walletAddress = wallet.address;
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Text('Wallet Address: $walletAddress'),
        SizedBox(height: 20),
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Example of sending a transaction
            sendTransaction();
          },
          child: Text('Send Transaction'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }

  void sendTransaction() {
    // Here you would implement the logic to send a transaction
    // For demonstration, we will just print a message
    print('Transaction sent from $walletAddress');
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, a WalletWidget is displayed at the center of the screen.
// 4. The WalletWidget initializes the Thor SDK and creates a new wallet in its initState method.
// 5. The wallet address is displayed on the screen.
// 6. When the "Send Transaction" button is pressed, the sendTransaction method is called, which currently just prints a message to the console.
```
