# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the SMS User Consent Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `sms_user_consent` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  sms_user_consent: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/sms_user_consent).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SEND_SMS"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_SMS"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key-value pair to request permission for sending SMS:

```xml
<key>NSContactsUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your contacts to send SMS.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to request user consent and send an SMS.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sms_user_consent/sms_user_consent.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('SMS User Consent Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Request user consent for sending SMS
              final consent = await SmsUserConsent.requestConsent();
              if (consent) {
                // User granted consent, proceed to send SMS
                SmsUserConsent.sendSms(
                  phoneNumber: '1234567890',
                  message: 'Hello from RealFlutter!',
                );
              } else {
                // User denied consent
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Consent denied!')),
                );
              }
            },
            child: Text('Send SMS'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the user taps the "Send SMS" button, the app requests consent to send an SMS. If the user grants consent, the app sends an SMS to the specified phone number.

# Complete Example of SMS User Consent

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sms_user_consent/sms_user_consent.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('SMS User Consent Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Request user consent for sending SMS
              final consent = await SmsUserConsent.requestConsent();
              if (consent) {
                // User granted consent, proceed to send SMS
                SmsUserConsent.sendSms(
                  phoneNumber: '1234567890', // Replace with actual phone number
                  message: 'Hello from RealFlutter!', // Message to send
                );
              } else {
                // User denied consent
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Consent denied!')),
                );
              }
            },
            child: Text('Send SMS'), // Button to trigger SMS sending
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and displays a button labeled "Send SMS".
// 2. When the user taps the button, the app calls `SmsUserConsent.requestConsent()` to show a consent dialog.
// 3. If the user grants consent, the app proceeds to send an SMS using `SmsUserConsent.sendSms()`.
// 4. If the user denies consent, a SnackBar message is displayed indicating that consent was denied.
// 5. The SMS is sent to the specified phone number with the provided message if consent is granted.
