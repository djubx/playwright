# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_popup_card

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_popup_card` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_popup_card: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

To use the `flutter_popup_card` package, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_popup_card/flutter_popup_card.dart';
```

You can then create a popup card by using the `PopupCard` widget. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
PopupCard(
  title: 'Hello World',
  content: 'This is a popup card example.',
  onTap: () {
    // Action when the card is tapped
  },
);
```

This will create a basic popup card that displays a title and content. You can customize it further by adding more properties as needed.

# Complete Example of flutter_popup_card

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_popup_card/flutter_popup_card.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Popup Card Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Popup Card Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Show the popup card when the button is pressed
              showDialog(
                context: context,
                builder: (BuildContext context) {
                  return PopupCard(
                    title: 'Welcome!',
                    content: 'This is a customizable popup card.',
                    onTap: () {
                      // Close the popup when tapped
                      Navigator.of(context).pop();
                    },
                  );
                },
              );
            },
            child: Text('Show Popup Card'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget with an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, a dialog is shown using showDialog.
// 5. Inside the dialog, a PopupCard is created with a title and content.
// 6. The PopupCard has an onTap function that closes the dialog when the card is tapped.
```
