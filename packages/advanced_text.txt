### Setup Process

To get started with the `advanced_text` package, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `advanced_text` package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     advanced_text: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the new package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the correct configurations for using custom fonts. You may need to add the following lines in the `android` block:

     ```groovy
     android {
         ...
         compileOptions {
             sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
             targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
         }
     }
     ```

   - **iOS**: For iOS, make sure to include any custom fonts in your `Info.plist` file. Add the following lines:

     ```xml
     <key>UIAppFonts</key>
     <array>
         <string>YourCustomFont.ttf</string>
     </array>
     ```

### Using the Package

After setting up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the `advanced_text` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:advanced_text/advanced_text.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Advanced Text Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: AdvancedText(
            'Hello, Flutter!',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
            textAlign: TextAlign.center,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:advanced_text/advanced_text.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Advanced Text Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Center widget to align the text in the middle of the screen
          child: AdvancedText(
            'Hello, Flutter!',
            // Setting the text content
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
            // Applying a bold style to the text
            textAlign: TextAlign.center,
            // Centering the text
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  // Entry point of the application
  runApp(RealFlutter());
  // Running the RealFlutter widget
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The main function is the entry point of the Flutter application.
2. The runApp function initializes the app and takes the RealFlutter widget as an argument.
3. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp, which provides the app structure.
4. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold widget is created, which provides the basic visual layout structure.
5. An AppBar is added to the Scaffold with the title 'Advanced Text Example'.
6. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget, which centers its child widget.
7. The AdvancedText widget is used to display the text 'Hello, Flutter!' with a specified style.
8. The text is styled to be bold and sized at 24 points, and it is centered on the screen.
