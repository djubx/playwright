# Acyclic Steps: A Flutter Package for Step-Based Navigation

The **acyclic_steps** package is a powerful tool for managing step-based navigation in Flutter applications. It allows developers to create a sequence of steps that users can navigate through, ensuring that the flow is acyclic—meaning users can only move forward or backward through the steps without looping back to previous steps in a way that disrupts the intended flow.

## When to Use This Package
This package is particularly useful in scenarios such as:
- **Onboarding Processes**: Guiding users through a series of steps to familiarize them with the app.
- **Form Filling**: Breaking down complex forms into manageable steps.
- **Multi-step Workflows**: Managing tasks that require user input across several stages.

## Key Features
- **Acyclic Navigation**: Ensures that users can only navigate through steps in a linear fashion.
- **Customizable Steps**: Each step can be customized with different widgets and content.
- **State Management**: Built-in support for managing the state of each step.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate into existing Flutter applications.

With these features, the **acyclic_steps** package provides a robust solution for developers looking to implement step-based navigation in their Flutter apps.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Acyclic Steps

## Installation
To add the **acyclic_steps** package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  acyclic_steps: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the **acyclic_steps** package, you will need to create a `RealFlutter` class that manages the steps. Here’s a simple example of how to set it up:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:acyclic_steps/acyclic_steps.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: StepNavigator(),
    );
  }
}

class StepNavigator extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return AcyclicSteps(
      steps: [
        Step(title: 'Step 1', content: Text('This is the first step')),
        Step(title: 'Step 2', content: Text('This is the second step')),
        Step(title: 'Step 3', content: Text('This is the third step')),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple step navigator with three steps. Each step has a title and content.

With this setup, you can easily navigate through the steps in your application.

# Complete Example of Acyclic Steps in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:acyclic_steps/acyclic_steps.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Acyclic Steps Example',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: StepNavigator(),
    );
  }
}

class StepNavigator extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _StepNavigatorState createState() => _StepNavigatorState();
}

class _StepNavigatorState extends State<StepNavigator> {
  // Step index to track the current step
  int _currentStep = 0;

  // List of steps
  final List<Step> _steps = [
    Step(title: 'Step 1', content: Text('This is the first step')),
    Step(title: 'Step 2', content: Text('This is the second step')),
    Step(title: 'Step 3', content: Text('This is the third step')),
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Acyclic Steps Example')),
      body: AcyclicSteps(
        currentStep: _currentStep,
        steps: _steps,
        onStepContinue: () {
          // Move to the next step
          if (_currentStep < _steps.length - 1) {
            setState(() {
              _currentStep++;
            });
          }
        },
        onStepCancel: () {
          // Move to the previous step
          if (_currentStep > 0) {
            setState(() {
              _currentStep--;
            });
          }
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a StepNavigator as the home widget.
// 3. StepNavigator maintains the current step index and a list of steps.
// 4. The AcyclicSteps widget displays the current step and provides buttons to continue or cancel.
// 5. When the user clicks "Continue", the current step index increments, moving to the next step.
// 6. When the user clicks "Cancel", the current step index decrements, moving back to the previous step.
// 7. The UI updates accordingly, showing the content of the current step.
