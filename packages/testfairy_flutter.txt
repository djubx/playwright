# Tutorial: Setting Up TestFairy in Your Flutter App

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the TestFairy Flutter package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the TestFairy package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  testfairy_flutter: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Configure for Android

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions and metadata:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.yourapp">

    <application
        android:name=".MainApplication"
        android:label="Your App"
        android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher">
        
        <meta-data
            android:name="TestFairyKey"
            android:value="YOUR_TESTFAIRY_KEY" /> <!-- Replace with your TestFairy key -->
        
        <!-- Other configurations -->
    </application>
</manifest>
```

2. **ProGuard Configuration**: If you are using ProGuard, add the following rules to `android/app/proguard-rules.pro`:

```pro
-keep class com.testfairy.** { *; }
```

## Step 3: Configure for iOS

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following key:

```xml
<key>TestFairyKey</key>
<string>YOUR_TESTFAIRY_KEY</string> <!-- Replace with your TestFairy key -->
```

2. **Enable Background Modes**: In Xcode, select your project, go to the "Capabilities" tab, and enable "Background Modes". Check "Background fetch" and "Remote notifications".

## Step 4: Initialize TestFairy

In your main Dart file, initialize TestFairy in the `main()` function:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:testfairy_flutter/testfairy_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize TestFairy with your key
  TestFairy.begin("YOUR_TESTFAIRY_KEY"); // Replace with your TestFairy key
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 5: Using TestFairy Features

You can now use various features of TestFairy in your app. For example, to log events or user feedback, you can use:

```dart
TestFairy.log("User clicked on the button");
```

You can also capture screenshots or record sessions as needed.

With these steps, you have successfully integrated the TestFairy Flutter package into your application. You can now start collecting valuable data from your users.

# Complete Example: TestFairy Flutter Integration

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:testfairy_flutter/testfairy_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize TestFairy with your key
  TestFairy.begin("YOUR_TESTFAIRY_KEY"); // Replace with your TestFairy key
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'TestFairy Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('TestFairy Flutter Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Press the button to log an event.',
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Log a button click event to TestFairy
                TestFairy.log("User clicked the log event button");
                // Show a snackbar to confirm the action
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Event logged!')),
                );
              },
              child: Text('Log Event'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes TestFairy with the provided key.
// 2. The RealFlutter class sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. MyHomePage is the main screen of the app, featuring a button.
// 4. When the button is pressed, an event is logged to TestFairy, and a snackbar confirms the action to the user.
```
