# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Thingsboard Client Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `thingsboard_client` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `thingsboard_client` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  thingsboard_client: ^<latest_version>
```

Make sure to replace `<latest_version>` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/thingsboard_client).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. Ensure that your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in `ios/Podfile`:

   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in our Flutter application.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

   ```dart
   import 'package:thingsboard_client/thingsboard_client.dart';
   ```

2. Initialize the ThingsBoard client and connect to the server:

   ```dart
   final ThingsBoardClient client = ThingsBoardClient('https://your-thingsboard-url.com');
   ```

3. Authenticate the user:

   ```dart
   await client.login('username', 'password');
   ```

4. Fetch devices and telemetry data:

   ```dart
   List<Device> devices = await client.getDevices();
   for (var device in devices) {
       var telemetry = await client.getTelemetry(device.id);
       print('Device: ${device.name}, Telemetry: $telemetry');
   }
   ```

With these steps, you can successfully set up and use the `thingsboard_client` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example: Thingsboard Client in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:thingsboard_client/thingsboard_client.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Thingsboard Client Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: ThingsboardHome(),
    );
  }
}

class ThingsboardHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ThingsboardHomeState createState() => _ThingsboardHomeState();
}

class _ThingsboardHomeState extends State<ThingsboardHome> {
  final ThingsBoardClient client = ThingsBoardClient('https://your-thingsboard-url.com');
  List<Device> devices = [];
  String errorMessage = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _initializeThingsboard();
  }

  // Initialize ThingsBoard client and fetch devices
  Future<void> _initializeThingsboard() async {
    try {
      // Log in to the ThingsBoard server
      await client.login('username', 'password');
      // Fetch the list of devices
      devices = await client.getDevices();
      setState(() {});
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors during initialization
      setState(() {
        errorMessage = 'Error: $e';
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Thingsboard Client Example'),
      ),
      body: errorMessage.isNotEmpty
          ? Center(child: Text(errorMessage))
          : ListView.builder(
              itemCount: devices.length,
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text(devices[index].name),
                  subtitle: Text('Device ID: ${devices[index].id}'),
                  onTap: () async {
                    // Fetch telemetry data for the selected device
                    var telemetry = await client.getTelemetry(devices[index].id);
                    // Show telemetry data in a dialog
                    showDialog(
                      context: context,
                      builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                        title: Text('Telemetry Data'),
                        content: Text(telemetry.toString()),
                        actions: [
                          TextButton(
                            onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                            child: Text('Close'),
                          ),
                        ],
                      ),
                    );
                  },
                );
              },
            ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home as ThingsboardHome.
// 3. In ThingsboardHome, the ThingsBoardClient is initialized with the ThingsBoard server URL.
// 4. During the initState, the _initializeThingsboard method is called to log in and fetch devices.
// 5. If successful, the devices are displayed in a ListView. If there's an error, an error message is shown.
// 6. Tapping on a device fetches its telemetry data and displays it in a dialog.
