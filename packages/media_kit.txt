# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Media Kit Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **media_kit** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **media_kit** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  media_kit: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/media_kit).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    compileSdkVersion 31 // or latest
    ...
}

dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'com.google.android.exoplayer:exoplayer:2.14.1' // or latest
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `ios/Podfile`.
2. Ensure that you have the following configurations:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0' # or latest
use_frameworks!

target 'Runner' do
  ...
  pod 'media_kit', :path => '../.symlinks/plugins/media_kit/ios'
end
```

3. Run `pod install` in the `ios` directory to install the necessary dependencies.

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in our Flutter application.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:media_kit/media_kit.dart';
```

2. Initialize the media player and load a media file:

```dart
final player = Player();
await player.open(Media.file('path_to_your_media_file.mp4'));
```

3. Control playback:

```dart
player.play(); // To start playback
player.pause(); // To pause playback
player.stop(); // To stop playback
```

With these steps, you can easily integrate the **media_kit** package into your Flutter application and start using its features.

# Complete Example of Media Kit in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:media_kit/media_kit.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Media Kit Example',
      home: MediaPlayerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class MediaPlayerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MediaPlayerScreenState createState() => _MediaPlayerScreenState();
}

class _MediaPlayerScreenState extends State<MediaPlayerScreen> {
  late Player _player; // Declare the media player
  bool _isPlaying = false; // Track playback state

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _player = Player(); // Initialize the player
    _initializePlayer(); // Load media file
  }

  Future<void> _initializePlayer() async {
    // Open a media file
    await _player.open(Media.file('path_to_your_media_file.mp4'));
  }

  void _togglePlayback() {
    // Toggle play/pause state
    if (_isPlaying) {
      _player.pause(); // Pause if currently playing
    } else {
      _player.play(); // Play if currently paused
    }
    setState(() {
      _isPlaying = !_isPlaying; // Update playback state
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _player.dispose(); // Dispose of the player when done
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Media Player'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _togglePlayback, // Toggle playback on button press
          child: Text(_isPlaying ? 'Pause' : 'Play'), // Button text based on state
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The MediaPlayerScreen widget is created, which initializes the media player.
// 3. In the initState method, the player is initialized and a media file is loaded.
// 4. The user can toggle playback by pressing the button, which calls _togglePlayback.
// 5. The button text changes based on whether the media is currently playing or paused.
// 6. When the widget is disposed, the player is also disposed to free up resources.
```
