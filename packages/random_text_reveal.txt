# Complete Example of Using Random Text Reveal

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:random_text_reveal/random_text_reveal.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Random Text Reveal Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Random Text Reveal'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: RandomTextReveal(
            // List of texts to reveal randomly
            texts: ['Hello, World!', 'Welcome to Flutter!', 'Enjoy Coding!', 'Animations are Fun!'],
            // Duration for each text reveal
            duration: Duration(seconds: 3),
            // Text style for the revealed text
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 30, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold, color: Colors.blue),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, the RandomTextReveal widget is used.
// 5. The RandomTextReveal widget takes a list of texts, a duration for the reveal, and a text style.
// 6. Every 3 seconds, a new text from the list is revealed with the specified style, creating an engaging animation.
