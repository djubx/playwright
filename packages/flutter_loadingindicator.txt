# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_loadingindicator

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `flutter_loadingindicator` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_loadingindicator: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_loadingindicator/flutter_loadingindicator.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Loading Indicator

You can use the loading indicator in your widget tree. Here’s how to implement it in a simple Flutter app:

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Example Usage

Here’s a simple example of how to use the loading indicator in a Flutter application:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_loadingindicator/flutter_loadingindicator.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Loading Indicator Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: LoadingIndicator(
            indicatorType: Indicator.circle, // Choose your indicator type
            colors: [Colors.blue, Colors.red], // Customize colors
            strokeWidth: 4.0, // Customize stroke width
            backgroundColor: Colors.white, // Background color
            pathBackgroundColor: Colors.black, // Path background color
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that displays a loading indicator in the center of the screen. You can customize the `indicatorType`, `colors`, and other properties to fit your design needs.

# Complete Example of flutter_loadingindicator

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_loadingindicator/flutter_loadingindicator.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Loading Indicator Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Center widget to position the loading indicator
          child: LoadingIndicator(
            indicatorType: Indicator.circle, // Set the type of loading indicator
            colors: [Colors.blue, Colors.red], // Define the colors for the indicator
            strokeWidth: 4.0, // Set the stroke width of the indicator
            backgroundColor: Colors.white, // Background color of the loading indicator
            pathBackgroundColor: Colors.black, // Path background color
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the app
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Loading Indicator Example'.
// 4. In the body of the Scaffold, a Center widget is used to center the LoadingIndicator.
// 5. The LoadingIndicator is configured with a circular indicator type, custom colors, and stroke width.
// 6. When the app runs, the loading indicator is displayed in the center of the screen, providing visual feedback to the user.
