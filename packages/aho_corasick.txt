# Aho-Corasick Flutter Package: Efficient Multi-Pattern String Matching

The `aho_corasick` package is a powerful tool for developers looking to implement efficient multi-pattern string matching in their Flutter applications. This package is based on the Aho-Corasick algorithm, which allows for searching multiple keywords in a given text simultaneously. It is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to find occurrences of several patterns within a large body of text, such as in search engines, text editors, or data processing applications.

## When to Use This Package
- **Text Search**: When you need to search for multiple keywords in a document or a large text body.
- **Data Filtering**: In applications that require filtering or highlighting specific terms from user input or data streams.
- **Spam Detection**: For identifying multiple spam keywords in messages or comments.

## Features
- **Multi-Pattern Search**: Search for multiple patterns in a single pass through the text.
- **Efficient Performance**: The Aho-Corasick algorithm is optimized for speed, making it suitable for large datasets.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that can be easily integrated into any Flutter application.

Overall, the `aho_corasick` package is an excellent choice for developers needing efficient string matching capabilities in their Flutter projects.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Aho-Corasick Package

## Installation
To use the `aho_corasick` package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  aho_corasick: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
The `aho_corasick` package is designed to work seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms. There are no additional configurations required for either platform, making it easy to integrate into your Flutter application.

## Basic Usage
Here’s how to use the `aho_corasick` package in your Flutter application:

1. **Import the Package**: Start by importing the package in your Dart file.
2. **Create an Instance**: Initialize the Aho-Corasick instance with the patterns you want to search for.
3. **Search for Patterns**: Use the search method to find occurrences of the patterns in the text.

Here’s a simple example to illustrate these steps:

```dart
import 'package:aho_corasick/aho_corasick.dart';

void main() {
  // Create an instance of Aho-Corasick with the patterns
  final ac = AhoCorasick(['hello', 'world', 'flutter']);

  // The text to search in
  final text = 'hello from the flutter world!';

  // Search for patterns
  final matches = ac.findAllMatches(text);

  // Print the matches
  for (var match in matches) {
    print('Found "${match.pattern}" at index ${match.start}');
  }
}
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to set up the Aho-Corasick package and perform a search for multiple patterns in a given text.

# Complete Example: A Flutter Application Using Aho-Corasick

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:aho_corasick/aho_corasick.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Aho-Corasick Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Aho-Corasick String Matching'),
        ),
        body: StringSearchWidget(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class StringSearchWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _StringSearchWidgetState createState() => _StringSearchWidgetState();
}

class _StringSearchWidgetState extends State<StringSearchWidget> {
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController();
  final AhoCorasick _ac = AhoCorasick(['hello', 'world', 'flutter']);
  String _result = '';

  void _search() {
    // Get the input text from the controller
    final text = _controller.text;

    // Find all matches in the input text
    final matches = _ac.findAllMatches(text);

    // Prepare the result string
    if (matches.isNotEmpty) {
      _result = matches.map((m) => 'Found "${m.pattern}" at index ${m.start}').join('\n');
    } else {
      _result = 'No matches found.';
    }

    // Update the UI
    setState(() {});
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
      child: Column(
        children: [
          TextField(
            controller: _controller,
            decoration: InputDecoration(
              labelText: 'Enter text to search',
              suffixIcon: IconButton(
                icon: Icon(Icons.search),
                onPressed: _search,
              ),
            ),
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20),
          Text(_result),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget.
// 3. The StringSearchWidget is a stateful widget that manages user input and search results.
// 4. The user enters text into a TextField, and upon pressing the search icon, the _search method is called.
// 5. The _search method retrieves the input text, searches for patterns using the Aho-Corasick instance, and updates the result.
// 6. The results are displayed below the TextField, showing the found patterns and their indices.
