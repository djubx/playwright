In summary, the `debounce_builder` package provides a simple and easy-to-use way to debounce the rebuilding of widgets in Flutter. By wrapping the widget you want to debounce with the `DebounceBuilder` widget, you can delay the rebuild process for a short period of time, improving performance and preventing excessive rebuilding of widgets.
