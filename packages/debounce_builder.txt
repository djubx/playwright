# Debounce Builder: A Flutter Package for Efficient Input Handling

The `debounce_builder` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to manage input events efficiently. It is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to limit the frequency of function calls triggered by user input, such as text field changes or button presses. By implementing a debounce mechanism, you can enhance the performance of your application and improve user experience by reducing unnecessary processing.

## When to Use `debounce_builder`

- **Search Fields**: When implementing a search feature, you can debounce the input to avoid sending a request for every keystroke.
- **Form Validation**: Debouncing can help in validating form fields only after the user has stopped typing for a specified duration.
- **API Calls**: If your application makes API calls based on user input, debouncing can prevent excessive requests.

## Key Features

- **Customizable Debounce Duration**: You can specify how long to wait before executing the function after the last input event.
- **Easy Integration**: The package is straightforward to integrate into existing Flutter applications.
- **Flexible Usage**: Works with various input types, including text fields and buttons.

Overall, `debounce_builder` is an essential package for any Flutter developer looking to optimize input handling in their applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `debounce_builder`

## Installation

To use the `debounce_builder` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  debounce_builder: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Usage

### Basic Setup

To use the `debounce_builder`, you need to import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:debounce_builder/debounce_builder.dart';
```

### Example Implementation

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use `debounce_builder` with a text field:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:debounce_builder/debounce_builder.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Debounce Builder Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: DebounceBuilder(
            duration: Duration(milliseconds: 500), // Set debounce duration
            builder: (context, callback) {
              return Column(
                mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
                children: [
                  TextField(
                    onChanged: (value) {
                      // Call the callback to trigger debounce
                      callback();
                      print('User input: $value');
                    },
                    decoration: InputDecoration(
                      hintText: 'Type something...',
                    ),
                  ),
                  SizedBox(height: 20),
                  Text('Debounced input will be processed here.'),
                ],
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Platform-Specific Details

For both Android and iOS, no additional configurations are required to use the `debounce_builder` package. Just ensure that your Flutter environment is set up correctly.

# Complete Example of `debounce_builder`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:debounce_builder/debounce_builder.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Debounce Builder Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: DebounceBuilder(
            duration: Duration(milliseconds: 500), // Set debounce duration
            builder: (context, callback) {
              return Column(
                mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
                children: [
                  TextField(
                    onChanged: (value) {
                      // Call the callback to trigger debounce
                      callback();
                      print('User input: $value'); // Print user input
                    },
                    decoration: InputDecoration(
                      hintText: 'Type something...',
                    ),
                  ),
                  SizedBox(height: 20),
                  Text('Debounced input will be processed here.'),
                ],
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, a DebounceBuilder is created with a debounce duration of 500 milliseconds.
// 4. The builder function of DebounceBuilder provides a callback that is called whenever the text field changes.
// 5. When the user types in the TextField, the onChanged event triggers, calling the callback to debounce the input.
// 6. The current user input is printed to the console, but only after the user has stopped typing for 500 milliseconds.
// 7. The Text widget below the TextField serves as a placeholder for displaying debounced input processing.
