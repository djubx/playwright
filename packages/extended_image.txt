# Tutorial: Setting Up Extended Image

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started with the **extended_image** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  extended_image: ^6.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install Packages

Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add permissions for accessing the photo library in your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to upload images.</string>
```

## Step 4: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to display an image using the **extended_image** package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:extended_image/extended_image.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Extended Image Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ExtendedImage.network(
            'https://example.com/image.jpg',
            fit: BoxFit.cover,
            cache: true,
            // Enable zoom and pan
            mode: ExtendedImageMode.Gesture,
            initGestureConfigHandler: (state) {
              return GestureConfig(
                minScale: 0.8,
                maxScale: 3.0,
                animationMinScale: 0.8,
                animationMaxScale: 3.0,
                speed: 1.0,
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application that displays an image from a network source with zoom and pan capabilities.

# Complete Example of Extended Image

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:extended_image/extended_image.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Extended Image Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Using ExtendedImage to display an image with zoom and pan capabilities
          child: ExtendedImage.network(
            'https://example.com/image.jpg', // URL of the image
            fit: BoxFit.cover, // Fit the image to cover the available space
            cache: true, // Enable caching for better performance
            mode: ExtendedImageMode.Gesture, // Enable gesture controls
            initGestureConfigHandler: (state) {
              return GestureConfig(
                minScale: 0.8, // Minimum zoom scale
                maxScale: 3.0, // Maximum zoom scale
                animationMinScale: 0.8, // Animation minimum scale
                animationMaxScale: 3.0, // Animation maximum scale
                speed: 1.0, // Speed of the zooming animation
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The MaterialApp widget is created, providing the basic structure of the app.
// 3. A Scaffold widget is used to create the app's visual structure, including an AppBar and a body.
// 4. In the body, an ExtendedImage widget is used to load an image from a network source.
// 5. The image is set to cover the available space, and caching is enabled for performance.
// 6. Gesture controls are enabled, allowing users to zoom in and out of the image using pinch gestures.
// 7. The initGestureConfigHandler defines the zooming behavior, including minimum and maximum scales.
// 8. The app is ready to run, and users can interact with the image by zooming and panning.
```

In summary, the **extended_image** package provides a robust solution for handling images in Flutter applications. With its zooming and panning capabilities, caching features, and easy setup, it is an excellent choice for developers looking to enhance their image handling functionalities. The provided example demonstrates how to implement these features effectively, allowing for a smooth user experience.
