# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Animated Card Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the **animated_card** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  animated_card: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:animated_card/animated_card.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Animated Card
You can now use the `AnimatedCard` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
AnimatedCard(
  direction: AnimatedCardDirection.right,
  child: Card(
    elevation: 4,
    child: Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
      child: Text('Hello, Animated Card!'),
    ),
  ),
)
```

This code snippet creates a card that animates from the right when it appears.

## Conclusion
The **animated_card** package is a straightforward yet powerful way to add animations to your Flutter applications. By following the steps above, you can easily integrate it into your project and start creating engaging user interfaces.

# Complete Example of Using Animated Card

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_card/animated_card.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animated Card Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Animated Card Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // AnimatedCard widget that animates from the right
              AnimatedCard(
                direction: AnimatedCardDirection.right,
                child: Card(
                  elevation: 4,
                  child: Padding(
                    padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
                    child: Text('Hello, Animated Card!'),
                  ),
                ),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adds space between cards
              // Another AnimatedCard widget that animates from the left
              AnimatedCard(
                direction: AnimatedCardDirection.left,
                child: Card(
                  elevation: 4,
                  child: Padding(
                    padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
                    child: Text('Another Animated Card!'),
                  ),
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Animated Card Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Column widget.
// 5. Inside the Column, two AnimatedCard widgets are created.
// 6. The first AnimatedCard animates from the right and contains a Card with text 'Hello, Animated Card!'.
// 7. A SizedBox is used to add space between the two cards.
// 8. The second AnimatedCard animates from the left and contains a Card with text 'Another Animated Card!'.
// 9. The animations provide a smooth transition effect when the cards appear on the screen.
