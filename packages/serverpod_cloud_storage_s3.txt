# Overview of the serverpod_cloud_storage_s3 Flutter Package

The `serverpod_cloud_storage_s3` package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who need to integrate Amazon S3 cloud storage into their applications. This package simplifies the process of uploading, downloading, and managing files in S3, making it an excellent choice for applications that require robust file storage solutions.

## When to Use This Package
- **File Uploads**: When your application needs to allow users to upload images, documents, or any other files to the cloud.
- **File Downloads**: If your app requires downloading files from S3 for offline access or display.
- **File Management**: For applications that need to manage files, such as listing, deleting, or updating files stored in S3.

## Key Features
- **Seamless Integration**: Easily integrates with existing Flutter applications.
- **S3 Compatibility**: Fully compatible with Amazon S3, leveraging its powerful storage capabilities.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Utilizes Dart's async/await features for non-blocking file operations.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in error handling to manage issues during file operations.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS platforms.

This package is ideal for developers looking to implement cloud storage solutions without the complexity of managing S3 directly.

# Setting Up and Using serverpod_cloud_storage_s3

## Installation
To get started with the `serverpod_cloud_storage_s3` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  serverpod_cloud_storage_s3: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/serverpod_cloud_storage_s3).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to upload images.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to take photos.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the package, you will need to initialize it with your AWS credentials and then you can start performing file operations.

```dart
import 'package:serverpod_cloud_storage_s3/serverpod_cloud_storage_s3.dart';

class RealFlutter {
  final S3Storage s3Storage;

  RealFlutter(this.s3Storage);

  Future<void> uploadFile(String filePath) async {
    try {
      await s3Storage.uploadFile(filePath);
      print('File uploaded successfully!');
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error uploading file: $e');
    }
  }

  Future<void> downloadFile(String fileName) async {
    try {
      final file = await s3Storage.downloadFile(fileName);
      print('File downloaded: ${file.path}');
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error downloading file: $e');
    }
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Using serverpod_cloud_storage_s3

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:serverpod_cloud_storage_s3/serverpod_cloud_storage_s3.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'S3 Storage Example',
      home: S3StorageExample(),
    );
  }
}

class S3StorageExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _S3StorageExampleState createState() => _S3StorageExampleState();
}

class _S3StorageExampleState extends State<S3StorageExample> {
  late RealFlutter realFlutter;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the S3Storage with your AWS credentials
    realFlutter = RealFlutter(S3Storage(
      bucket: 'your-bucket-name',
      region: 'your-region',
      accessKey: 'your-access-key',
      secretKey: 'your-secret-key',
    ));
  }

  // Function to upload a file
  void _uploadFile() async {
    String filePath = 'path/to/your/file.jpg'; // Replace with your file path
    await realFlutter.uploadFile(filePath);
  }

  // Function to download a file
  void _downloadFile() async {
    String fileName = 'file.jpg'; // Replace with your file name
    await realFlutter.downloadFile(fileName);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('S3 Storage Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _uploadFile,
              child: Text('Upload File'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _downloadFile,
              child: Text('Download File'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and home widget set to S3StorageExample.
// 3. In S3StorageExample, we initialize the RealFlutter class with S3Storage, providing AWS credentials.
// 4. The UI consists of two buttons: one for uploading a file and another for downloading a file.
// 5. When the user presses the "Upload File" button, the _uploadFile method is called, which triggers the upload process.
// 6. Similarly, pressing the "Download File" button calls the _downloadFile method to download the specified file.
// 7. The results of the operations are printed to the console for feedback.
