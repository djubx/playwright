# Root Jailbreak Detector Flutter Package

The `root_jailbreak_detector` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to help developers identify whether a device is rooted (Android) or jailbroken (iOS). This is crucial for applications that require a high level of security, such as banking apps, sensitive data applications, or any app that handles personal information. By detecting these conditions, developers can take appropriate actions, such as restricting access to certain features or displaying warnings to users.

## When to Use This Package

- **Security-Sensitive Applications**: If your app deals with sensitive user data, it is essential to ensure that it runs on a secure device.
- **Compliance Requirements**: Many industries have compliance requirements that necessitate the detection of rooted or jailbroken devices.
- **User Experience**: Informing users about the risks of using your app on a compromised device can enhance user trust and safety.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Simple API**: Easy to integrate and use within your Flutter application.
- **Real-Time Detection**: Provides immediate feedback on the device's security status.
- **Customizable Responses**: Developers can define how to handle detected rooted or jailbroken devices.

By leveraging this package, developers can significantly enhance the security posture of their applications and protect user data effectively.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Root Jailbreak Detector

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `root_jailbreak_detector` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `root_jailbreak_detector` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  root_jailbreak_detector: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/root_jailbreak_detector).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Ensure you have the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to allow the app to access device information:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the root/jailbreak detection.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:root_jailbreak_detector/root_jailbreak_detector.dart';
```

2. Create a method to check for root/jailbreak status:

```dart
Future<void> checkDeviceSecurity() async {
  bool isJailbroken = await RootJailbreakDetector.isJailbroken;
  bool isRooted = await RootJailbreakDetector.isRooted;

  if (isJailbroken || isRooted) {
    // Handle the case for rooted/jailbroken devices
    print("Device is compromised!");
  } else {
    // Proceed with normal app functionality
    print("Device is secure.");
  }
}
```

3. Call this method during your app's initialization or at a relevant point in your app's flow.

With these steps, you can effectively integrate the `root_jailbreak_detector` package into your Flutter application and ensure that you are aware of the security status of the devices running your app.

# Complete Example: Flutter Application Using Root Jailbreak Detector

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:root_jailbreak_detector/root_jailbreak_detector.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Root Jailbreak Detector Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  String _securityStatus = "Checking device security...";

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    checkDeviceSecurity(); // Call the security check on initialization
  }

  Future<void> checkDeviceSecurity() async {
    // Check if the device is jailbroken or rooted
    bool isJailbroken = await RootJailbreakDetector.isJailbroken;
    bool isRooted = await RootJailbreakDetector.isRooted;

    // Update the security status based on the checks
    setState(() {
      if (isJailbroken || isRooted) {
        _securityStatus = "Device is compromised!";
      } else {
        _securityStatus = "Device is secure.";
      }
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Root Jailbreak Detector'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          _securityStatus,
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is a stateful widget that checks the device's security status on initialization.
// 4. In the initState method, checkDeviceSecurity() is called to determine if the device is jailbroken or rooted.
// 5. The checkDeviceSecurity method uses the RootJailbreakDetector to check the device status and updates the UI accordingly.
// 6. The security status is displayed in the center of the screen, informing the user whether the device is secure or compromised.
