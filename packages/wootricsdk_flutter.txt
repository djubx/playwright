// Summary:
// The RealFlutter app uses WootricSDK Flutter to collect user feedback and measure customer satisfaction.
// The app initializes WootricSDK Flutter with the API key and survey settings, and shows a button to the user to show the survey.
// When the user clicks the button, the app shows the survey using WootricSDK Flutter, and the user completes the survey and submits their feedback.
// WootricSDK Flutter sends the feedback to the Wootric server for analysis, providing valuable insights to improve the app.
