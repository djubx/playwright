# Tutorial: Setting Up Adapty UI Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **adapty_ui_flutter** package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the **adapty_ui_flutter** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  adapty_ui_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure that you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<manifest>
    ...
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
</manifest>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. Ensure that your iOS deployment target is set to at least 11.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '11.0'
```

## Step 3: Initialize Adapty

In your main application file, initialize the Adapty SDK. You can do this in the `main()` function:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:adapty_ui_flutter/adapty_ui_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  Adapty.initialize('YOUR_ADAPTY_API_KEY'); // Replace with your Adapty API key
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 4: Using Adapty UI Components

You can now use the UI components provided by the **adapty_ui_flutter** package in your application. For example, to display a subscription screen, you can use the `AdaptySubscriptionScreen` widget:

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Subscriptions')),
    body: AdaptySubscriptionScreen(
      onPurchaseSuccess: (purchase) {
        // Handle successful purchase
      },
      onPurchaseError: (error) {
        // Handle purchase error
      },
    ),
  );
}
```

This will render a subscription screen with options for users to select and purchase subscriptions.

With these steps, you have successfully set up the **adapty_ui_flutter** package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Adapty UI Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:adapty_ui_flutter/adapty_ui_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  Adapty.initialize('YOUR_ADAPTY_API_KEY'); // Initialize Adapty with your API key
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the main application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Adapty UI Example',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: SubscriptionPage(), // Set the home page to SubscriptionPage
    );
  }
}

class SubscriptionPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Subscriptions')),
      body: AdaptySubscriptionScreen(
        onPurchaseSuccess: (purchase) {
          // Handle successful purchase
          ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
            SnackBar(content: Text('Purchase successful!')),
          );
        },
        onPurchaseError: (error) {
          // Handle purchase error
          ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
            SnackBar(content: Text('Purchase failed: $error')),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Adapty SDK with the provided API key.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is the root of the application, setting up the MaterialApp.
// 3. The SubscriptionPage class builds the UI for subscriptions, using AdaptySubscriptionScreen.
// 4. When a user successfully purchases a subscription, a success message is displayed.
// 5. If there is an error during the purchase, an error message is shown to the user.
