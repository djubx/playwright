# Tutorial: Setting Up flutter_paypal_native

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_paypal_native` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the `flutter_paypal_native` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_paypal_native: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version required
    }
}
```

2. Add the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<manifest>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
    <application>
        ...
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.paypal.sdk.android.clientId"
            android:value="YOUR_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID"/>
    </application>
</manifest>
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
<key>PaypalClientId</key>
<string>YOUR_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID</string>
```

2. Ensure you have the required permissions in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that we have configured the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is an example of how to implement PayPal payment processing.

# Complete Example of flutter_paypal_native

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_paypal_native/flutter_paypal_native.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'PayPal Native Example',
      home: PaymentScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PaymentScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PaymentScreenState createState() => _PaymentScreenState();
}

class _PaymentScreenState extends State<PaymentScreen> {
  // Function to initiate PayPal payment
  void _startPayment() async {
    // Create a PayPal payment request
    var response = await FlutterPaypalNative.startPayPalPayment(
      clientId: 'YOUR_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID',
      secret: 'YOUR_PAYPAL_SECRET',
      amount: '10.00', // Amount to be charged
      currency: 'USD', // Currency type
      description: 'Payment for services', // Description of the payment
    );

    // Check the response from PayPal
    if (response['status'] == 'success') {
      // Payment was successful
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Payment Successful!')),
      );
    } else {
      // Payment failed
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Payment Failed: ${response['message']}')),
      );
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('PayPal Payment'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _startPayment, // Start payment on button press
          child: Text('Pay with PayPal'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application that integrates PayPal payment processing using the flutter_paypal_native package. 

// The main function initializes the app and sets the home screen to PaymentScreen. 
// In the PaymentScreen, we define a button that, when pressed, triggers the _startPayment function. 
// This function creates a payment request with the necessary details such as client ID, amount, currency, and description. 
// After the payment process, it checks the response and displays a success or failure message accordingly. 

// This flow ensures that users can easily make payments through PayPal, enhancing the overall user experience in the app.
