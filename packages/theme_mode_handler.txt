# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Theme Mode Handler

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `theme_mode_handler` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `theme_mode_handler` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  theme_mode_handler: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:theme_mode_handler/theme_mode_handler.dart';
```

## Step 3: Initialize Theme Mode Handler

You need to initialize the `ThemeModeHandler` in your main application file. This is typically done in the `main()` function:

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized(); // Ensure binding is initialized
  await ThemeModeHandler.init(); // Initialize the theme mode handler
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 4: Configure Android and iOS

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary configurations to support dark mode. You can set the theme in the manifest file:

```xml
<application
    android:theme="@style/Theme.AppCompat.DayNight">
```

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your `Info.plist` file includes the following key to support dark mode:

```xml
<key>UIUserInterfaceStyle</key>
<string>Automatic</string>
```

## Step 5: Using Theme Mode Handler in Your App

You can now use the `ThemeModeHandler` to manage the theme in your application. Hereâ€™s how to implement it in your widget tree:

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return MaterialApp(
    title: 'Theme Mode Handler Example',
    theme: ThemeData.light(), // Define your light theme
    darkTheme: ThemeData.dark(), // Define your dark theme
    themeMode: ThemeModeHandler.getThemeMode(), // Get the current theme mode
    home: HomeScreen(),
  );
}
```

## Step 6: Allow Users to Change Theme

You can provide a toggle button in your UI to allow users to switch between themes:

```dart
IconButton(
  icon: Icon(Icons.brightness_6),
  onPressed: () {
    ThemeModeHandler.toggleTheme(); // Toggle the theme mode
    setState(() {}); // Update the UI
  },
)
```

With these steps, you have successfully set up and integrated the `theme_mode_handler` package into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Theme Mode Handler

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:theme_mode_handler/theme_mode_handler.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized(); // Ensure Flutter is initialized
  await ThemeModeHandler.init(); // Initialize the theme mode handler
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the main application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Theme Mode Handler Example',
      theme: ThemeData.light(), // Define the light theme
      darkTheme: ThemeData.dark(), // Define the dark theme
      themeMode: ThemeModeHandler.getThemeMode(), // Get the current theme mode
      home: HomeScreen(), // Set the home screen
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Theme Mode Handler Example'), // App bar title
        actions: [
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.brightness_6), // Icon for theme toggle
            onPressed: () {
              ThemeModeHandler.toggleTheme(); // Toggle the theme mode
              // Call setState to update the UI
              (context as Element).markNeedsBuild(); // Force rebuild to reflect theme change
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Press the button to toggle theme!', // Instruction text
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20), // Text style
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter framework and the ThemeModeHandler.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is the root widget that sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp defines light and dark themes and retrieves the current theme mode.
// 4. The HomeScreen widget displays a simple UI with a button to toggle the theme.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the theme mode is toggled, and the UI is updated to reflect the change.
```
