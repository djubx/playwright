# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Circular Countdown

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the `circular_countdown` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  circular_countdown: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Circular Countdown
Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `CircularCountdown` widget.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:circular_countdown/circular_countdown.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Circular Countdown Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: CircularCountdown(
            duration: 60, // Countdown duration in seconds
            width: 200, // Width of the circular countdown
            height: 200, // Height of the circular countdown
            color: Colors.blue, // Color of the countdown
            fillColor: Colors.red, // Color of the filled portion
            strokeWidth: 10, // Width of the stroke
            isReverse: true, // Reverse the countdown
            onComplete: () {
              // Action to perform when countdown completes
              print('Countdown completed!');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

# Complete Example of Circular Countdown

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:circular_countdown/circular_countdown.dart';

// Main class for the Flutter application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Circular Countdown Example'), // Title of the app
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: CircularCountdown(
            duration: 60, // Set the countdown duration to 60 seconds
            width: 200, // Set the width of the circular countdown
            height: 200, // Set the height of the circular countdown
            color: Colors.blue, // Set the color of the countdown circle
            fillColor: Colors.red, // Set the color of the filled portion
            strokeWidth: 10, // Set the stroke width of the countdown
            isReverse: true, // Enable reverse countdown
            onComplete: () {
              // Callback function when the countdown completes
              print('Countdown completed!'); // Print message to console
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
3. Inside the Center widget, a CircularCountdown widget is created with a duration of 60 seconds.
4. The countdown is displayed in a circular format with specified colors and stroke width.
5. When the countdown reaches zero, the onComplete callback is triggered, printing a message to the console.
6. The countdown is animated, providing a smooth visual experience for the user.
