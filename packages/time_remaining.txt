# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Time Remaining Package
===========================================================

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Flutter Project

To use the `time_remaining` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under the `dependencies` section:

```yml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  time_remaining: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` in your terminal to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the `time_remaining` package:

```dart
import 'package:time_remaining/time_remaining.dart';
```

### Step 3: Create a TimeRemaining Instance

Create a `TimeRemaining` instance, passing the event deadline as a `DateTime` object:

```dart
TimeRemaining timeRemaining = TimeRemaining(deadline: DateTime(2024, 12, 31));
```

### Step 4: Display the Remaining Time

Use the `timeRemaining` instance to display the remaining time:

```dart
Text(timeRemaining.remainingTime);
```

### Platform-Specific Details

The `time_remaining` package works on both Android and iOS platforms. However, if you need to customize the appearance or behavior of the package on a specific platform, you can use platform-specific code.

For example, to change the font size on Android:

```dart
import 'dart:io' show Platform;

// ...

Text(timeRemaining.remainingTime,
  style: TextStyle(fontSize: Platform.isAndroid ? 24 : 18),
)
```

### Required Configurations or Optimizations

The `time_remaining` package does not require any specific configurations or optimizations. However, you may want to consider the following:

*   Update the `deadline` property when the event deadline changes.
*   Use a `Timer` to periodically update the remaining time.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:time_remaining/time_remaining.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Time Remaining Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  TimeRemaining _timeRemaining;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _timeRemaining = TimeRemaining(deadline: DateTime(2024, 12, 31));
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Time Remaining Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              _timeRemaining.remainingTime,
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 48),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 24),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                setState(() {
                  _timeRemaining.deadline = DateTime(2025, 1, 1);
                });
              },
              child: Text('Update Deadline'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app, and the `MyApp` widget is created.
// 2. The `MyApp` widget builds the `MyHomePage` widget.
// 3. The `MyHomePage` widget creates a `TimeRemaining` instance with a deadline of December 31, 2024.
// 4. The `MyHomePage` widget displays the remaining time using the `TimeRemaining` instance.
// 5. When the user presses the "Update Deadline" button, the deadline is updated to January 1, 2025.
// 6. The `MyHomePage` widget rebuilds itself with the new deadline, and the remaining time is updated accordingly.

// In summary, this code demonstrates how to use the `time_remaining` package to display the remaining time for a specific event or deadline. It also shows how to update the deadline and rebuild the widget to reflect the changes.
