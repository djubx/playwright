# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Search Map Location Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `search_map_location` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  search_map_location: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/search_map_location).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // or higher
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys for location permissions:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show nearby places.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show nearby places.</string>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that the package is set up, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the search functionality.

# Complete Example of Using Search Map Location

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:search_map_location/search_map_location.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Search Map Location Example',
      home: LocationSearchScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class LocationSearchScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _LocationSearchScreenState createState() => _LocationSearchScreenState();
}

class _LocationSearchScreenState extends State<LocationSearchScreen> {
  String? selectedLocation; // Variable to hold the selected location

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Search Map Location'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Search bar for location input
          SearchMapLocation(
            onSelected: (place) {
              // Callback when a location is selected
              setState(() {
                selectedLocation = place.description; // Update selected location
              });
            },
            apiKey: 'YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY', // Replace with your API key
            // Optional: Customize the search bar
            searchHint: 'Search for a location',
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20),
          // Display the selected location
          Text(
            selectedLocation != null ? 'Selected Location: $selectedLocation' : 'No location selected',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (LocationSearchScreen).
// 3. LocationSearchScreen is a stateful widget that maintains the selected location state.
// 4. The SearchMapLocation widget is used to create a search bar for location input.
// 5. When a user selects a location, the onSelected callback is triggered, updating the selectedLocation state.
// 6. The selected location is displayed below the search bar, providing feedback to the user.
```
