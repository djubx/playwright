# Setting Up the rrule_generator Package

To use the `rrule_generator` package, follow these steps:

1. Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  rrule_generator: ^1.0.0
```
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.
3. Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:rrule_generator/rrule_generator.dart';
```
## Platform-Specific Configurations

### Android

No additional configurations are required for Android.

### iOS

No additional configurations are required for iOS.

## Using the Package

To generate recurring events, create an instance of the `RRuleGenerator` class and specify the recurrence rule:
```dart
RRuleGenerator generator = RRuleGenerator(
  frequency: Frequency.DAILY,
  interval: 1,
  duration: Duration(days: 30),
);
```
Then, use the `generate` method to generate the recurring events:
```dart
List<DateTime> events = generator.generate();
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:rrule_generator/rrule_generator.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'RRule Generator Demo',
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  List<DateTime> _events = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _generateEvents();
  }

  void _generateEvents() {
    // Create an instance of the RRuleGenerator class
    RRuleGenerator generator = RRuleGenerator(
      frequency: Frequency.DAILY,
      interval: 1,
      duration: Duration(days: 30),
    );

    // Generate the recurring events
    List<DateTime> events = generator.generate();

    // Update the UI with the generated events
    setState(() {
      _events = events;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('RRule Generator Demo'),
      ),
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: _events.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return ListTile(
            title: Text(_events[index].toString()),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app, which creates an instance of the MyApp class.
// 2. The MyApp class builds the UI, which consists of a MaterialApp with a title and a home page.
// 3. The home page is an instance of the MyHomePage class, which is a stateful widget.
// 4. When the MyHomePage class is initialized, it calls the _generateEvents method to generate the recurring events.
// 5. The _generateEvents method creates an instance of the RRuleGenerator class and specifies the recurrence rule.
// 6. The RRuleGenerator class generates the recurring events, which are then stored in the _events list.
// 7. The UI is updated with the generated events, which are displayed in a ListView.
// 8. The user can then view the generated events in the ListView.
