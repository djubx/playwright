# Functional Widget Annotation in Flutter

The `functional_widget_annotation` package is a powerful tool in the Flutter ecosystem that allows developers to create stateless widgets using a functional programming style. This package simplifies widget creation by using annotations to generate boilerplate code, making your codebase cleaner and more maintainable.

## When to Use

This package is particularly useful when you want to:
- Reduce boilerplate code associated with creating stateless widgets.
- Embrace a functional programming style in your Flutter applications.
- Improve code readability and maintainability by focusing on widget logic rather than widget structure.

## Features

- **Annotation-Based**: Use annotations to define widgets, which the package then processes to generate the necessary code.
- **Stateless Widgets**: Primarily focuses on stateless widgets, which are ideal for UI components that do not require mutable state.
- **Code Generation**: Automatically generates widget classes, reducing the need for repetitive code.

# Setting Up and Using `functional_widget_annotation`

To get started with the `functional_widget_annotation` package, follow these steps:

## Setup

1. **Add Dependencies**: Add the following dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     functional_widget_annotation: ^0.3.0

   dev_dependencies:
     build_runner: ^2.1.0
     functional_widget: ^0.3.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run `flutter pub get` to install the new dependencies.

3. **Create a New Dart File**: Create a new Dart file where you will define your functional widgets.

## Using the Package

1. **Import the Package**: At the top of your Dart file, import the necessary packages:

   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
   import 'package:functional_widget_annotation/functional_widget_annotation.dart';
   ```

2. **Define a Functional Widget**: Use the `@swidget` annotation to define a stateless widget:

   ```dart
   @swidget
   Widget realFlutter(BuildContext context, String title) {
     return Text(title);
   }
   ```

3. **Run Code Generation**: Use the following command to generate the widget code:

   ```bash
   flutter pub run build_runner build
   ```

   This command will generate a file with the widget class, typically named `your_file_name.g.dart`.

## Platform-Specific Details

- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to support all Flutter features.
- **iOS**: Make sure your deployment target is set to iOS 9.0 or higher in your `ios/Podfile`.

## Optimizations

- Regularly run `flutter pub run build_runner build` to keep your generated code up to date.
- Use `flutter pub run build_runner watch` during development for automatic code generation.

```dart
// main.dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:functional_widget_annotation/functional_widget_annotation.dart';

// Import the generated file
part 'main.g.dart';

// Define a functional widget using the @swidget annotation
@swidget
Widget realFlutter(BuildContext context, String title) {
  // This widget simply returns a Text widget displaying the title
  return Text(title);
}

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// MyApp is the root widget of the application
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // MaterialApp is a convenience widget that wraps a number of widgets
    // that are commonly required for material design applications.
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Functional Widget Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

// MyHomePage is the main screen of the application
class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Scaffold provides a framework for implementing the basic material design layout
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Functional Widget Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        // Use the generated RealFlutter widget
        child: RealFlutter('Hello, RealFlutter!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// Application Flow Explanation
// The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() with MyApp.
// MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp, setting up the app's theme and home screen.
// MyHomePage is the home screen, which uses a Scaffold to provide a basic structure with an AppBar and a body.
// In the body of the Scaffold, the RealFlutter widget is used, which was generated from the realFlutter function.
// The RealFlutter widget displays a simple text message, demonstrating the use of functional_widget_annotation to create stateless widgets.
