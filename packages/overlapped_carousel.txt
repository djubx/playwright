# Tutorial: Setting up and Using Overlapped Carousel
=====================================================

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

Add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  overlapped_carousel: ^1.0.0
```
Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:overlapped_carousel/overlapped_carousel.dart';
```
### Step 3: Create an Overlapped Carousel

Create an `OverlappedCarousel` widget and pass in the required properties:
```dart
OverlappedCarousel(
  items: [
    // Your items here (images, widgets, etc.)
  ],
  overlapAmount: 0.5, // Adjust the overlap amount (0.0 to 1.0)
  navigationControls: true, // Optional navigation controls
)
```
### Platform-Specific Details

* For Android, you may need to adjust the `android:clipChildren` property in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file to prevent clipping issues.
* For iOS, you may need to adjust the `clipToBounds` property in your `Info.plist` file to prevent clipping issues.

### Optimizations

* To improve performance, consider using a smaller overlap amount or reducing the number of items in the carousel.
* To prevent unnecessary rebuilds, consider using a `Key` or `ValueKey` for each item in the carousel.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:overlapped_carousel/overlapped_carousel.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Overlapped Carousel Demo',
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  final List<Widget> _items = [
    // Item 1
    Container(
      color: Colors.red,
      child: Center(
        child: Text('Item 1'),
      ),
    ),
    // Item 2
    Container(
      color: Colors.blue,
      child: Center(
        child: Text('Item 2'),
      ),
    ),
    // Item 3
    Container(
      color: Colors.green,
      child: Center(
        child: Text('Item 3'),
      ),
    ),
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Overlapped Carousel Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: OverlappedCarousel(
          items: _items,
          overlapAmount: 0.5,
          navigationControls: true,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application flow:
// 1. The app starts and displays the `MyHomePage` widget.
// 2. The `MyHomePage` widget contains an `OverlappedCarousel` widget.
// 3. The `OverlappedCarousel` widget displays the items in the `_items` list.
// 4. The user can navigate through the items using the navigation controls.
// 5. The app updates the displayed item based on the user's navigation input.
```

// Summary:
// The code flows by first creating a list of items to be displayed in the carousel.
// The `OverlappedCarousel` widget is then created and passed the list of items and other properties.
// The app displays the `OverlappedCarousel` widget and allows the user to navigate through the items.
// The app updates the displayed item based on the user's navigation input.
