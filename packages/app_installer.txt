# Overview of the app_installer Flutter Package

The `app_installer` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to facilitate the installation of APK files on Android devices and IPA files on iOS devices directly from a Flutter application. This package is particularly useful for developers who want to provide users with the ability to install applications without navigating through app stores, making it ideal for beta testing, internal app distribution, or custom app installations.

## When to Use

- **Beta Testing**: When you want to distribute your app to testers without going through the app store.
- **Internal Distribution**: For companies that need to distribute apps internally to employees.
- **Custom Installations**: When you have a specific app that needs to be installed on devices without using the app store.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API to integrate into your Flutter application.
- **User-Friendly**: Provides a straightforward user experience for installing apps.

The `app_installer` package streamlines the process of app installation, making it a valuable addition to any Flutter developer's toolkit.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the app_installer Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `app_installer` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  app_installer: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/app_installer).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

2. **Target SDK**: Ensure your `targetSdkVersion` is set to 26 or higher in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    compileSdkVersion 31
    defaultConfig {
        targetSdkVersion 31
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Info.plist**: Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following key to allow installation of apps:

```xml
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
    <string>itms-apps</string>
</array>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initiate an app installation.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:app_installer/app_installer.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('App Installer Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Specify the path to the APK or IPA file
              String filePath = '/path/to/your/app.apk'; // Change this to your file path
              
              // Call the install method
              bool success = await AppInstaller.install(filePath);
              
              // Show a message based on the installation result
              if (success) {
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Installation Successful!')),
                );
              } else {
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Installation Failed!')),
                );
              }
            },
            child: Text('Install App'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with a button that, when pressed, attempts to install an app from a specified file path. The user is notified of the success or failure of the installation.

# Complete Example of Using app_installer

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:app_installer/app_installer.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('App Installer Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Specify the path to the APK or IPA file
              String filePath = '/path/to/your/app.apk'; // Change this to your file path
              
              // Call the install method
              bool success = await AppInstaller.install(filePath);
              
              // Show a message based on the installation result
              if (success) {
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Installation Successful!')),
                );
              } else {
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Installation Failed!')),
                );
              }
            },
            child: Text('Install App'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which builds a MaterialApp.
// 2. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. The Center widget contains an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, it triggers the onPressed callback.
// 5. The filePath variable is set to the location of the APK or IPA file.
// 6. The AppInstaller.install method is called with the filePath.
// 7. Based on the success of the installation, a SnackBar is shown to the user indicating whether the installation was successful or failed.
