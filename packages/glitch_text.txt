# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Glitch Text

## Installation
To use the **glitch_text** package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  glitch_text: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the latest version of Xcode installed. No additional configurations are necessary for using the **glitch_text** package.

## Basic Usage
To use the **glitch_text** package, you can import it into your Dart file as follows:

```dart
import 'package:glitch_text/glitch_text.dart';
```

You can then use the `GlitchText` widget in your widget tree. Here’s a simple example:

```dart
GlitchText(
  text: 'Glitch Effect',
  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 40, color: Colors.white),
);
```

This will render the text "Glitch Effect" with the default glitch effect applied.

### Customization
You can customize the glitch effect by adjusting parameters such as `glitchDuration`, `glitchIntensity`, and more. Here’s an example:

```dart
GlitchText(
  text: 'Custom Glitch',
  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 40, color: Colors.blue),
  glitchDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 500),
  glitchIntensity: 0.5,
);
```

This example demonstrates how to change the color, size, and glitch properties of the text.

With these steps, you can easily integrate and customize the **glitch_text** package in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Glitch Text

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:glitch_text/glitch_text.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Glitch Text Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Glitch Text Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying a simple glitch text
              GlitchText(
                text: 'Welcome to Glitch Text!',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 30, color: Colors.red),
                glitchDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 300),
                glitchIntensity: 0.7,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between texts
              // Displaying another glitch text with different properties
              GlitchText(
                text: 'Enjoy the Effects!',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 25, color: Colors.green),
                glitchDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 500),
                glitchIntensity: 0.5,
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'Glitch Text Demo'.
// The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child widgets.
// A Column widget is used to arrange the glitch texts vertically.
// The first GlitchText widget displays 'Welcome to Glitch Text!' with a red color and a glitch effect.
// The second GlitchText widget displays 'Enjoy the Effects!' with a green color and a different glitch effect.
// The SizedBox widget adds space between the two texts for better visual separation.
