- **Multiple Map Providers**: Supports various map providers, allowing flexibility in map styles.
- **Geolocation Support**: Easily integrate geolocation features to center the map on the user's current location.

## When to Use
- When you need users to select a location for a delivery or pickup.
- In applications that require geographical data input from users.
- For travel or navigation apps where location selection is essential.

The `map_picker` package simplifies the process of integrating maps into your Flutter applications, making it a valuable addition to your toolkit.

# Tutorial

## Setup Process

To get started with the `map_picker` package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the `map_picker` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  map_picker: ^latest_version
```

Replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

### Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/>
```

#### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys for location permissions:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show it on the map.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show it on the map.</string>
```

### Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:map_picker/map_picker.dart';
```

### Step 4: Basic Usage

You can now use the `MapPicker` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
MapPicker(
  onMapTapped: (location) {
    // Handle the location selected by the user
    print("Selected location: ${location.latitude}, ${location.longitude}");
  },
)
```

This will create a map where users can tap to select a location, and the coordinates will be printed to the console.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:map_picker/map_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Map Picker Example',
      home: MapPickerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class MapPickerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MapPickerScreenState createState() => _MapPickerScreenState();
}

class _MapPickerScreenState extends State<MapPickerScreen> {
  // Variable to hold the selected location
  LatLng? selectedLocation;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Map Picker Example'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Display the map picker
          Expanded(
            child: MapPicker(
              onMapTapped: (location) {
                // Update the selected location when the user taps on the map
                setState(() {
                  selectedLocation = location;
                });
              },
            ),
          ),
          // Display the selected location
          Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
            child: Text(
              selectedLocation != null
                  ? 'Selected Location: ${selectedLocation!.latitude}, ${selectedLocation!.longitude}'
                  : 'No location selected',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home screen.
// 3. The home screen is MapPickerScreen, which is a StatefulWidget to manage the selected location state.
// 4. Inside the MapPickerScreen, we define a variable to hold the selected location.
// 5. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Column layout.
// 6. The MapPicker widget is placed inside an Expanded widget to fill the available space.
// 7. When the user taps on the map, the onMapTapped callback updates the selectedLocation state.
// 8. Below the map, we display the selected location coordinates or a message indicating no location is selected.
```
