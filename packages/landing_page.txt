# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the "landing_page" Package

## Installation
To use the `landing_page` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  landing_page: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
Once the package is installed, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a landing page using the `landing_page` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:landing_page/landing_page.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Landing Page Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return LandingPage(
      title: 'Welcome to My App',
      subtitle: 'Your journey starts here',
      backgroundImage: 'assets/background.jpg', // Ensure this image is in your assets
      buttonText: 'Get Started',
      onButtonPressed: () {
        // Action when button is pressed
        print('Button Pressed!');
      },
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple landing page with a title, subtitle, background image, and a button. The `onButtonPressed` callback allows you to define what happens when the button is clicked.

# Complete Example of a Landing Page Using the "landing_page" Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:landing_page/landing_page.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Landing Page Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return LandingPage(
      title: 'Welcome to My App', // Main title of the landing page
      subtitle: 'Your journey starts here', // Subtitle providing additional context
      backgroundImage: 'assets/background.jpg', // Background image for the landing page
      buttonText: 'Get Started', // Text displayed on the button
      onButtonPressed: () {
        // Action when the button is pressed
        print('Button Pressed!'); // This will print to the console
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter creates a LandingPage widget with a title, subtitle, background image, and button.
// 4. When the button is pressed, it triggers the onButtonPressed callback, which currently prints a message to the console.
// 5. The LandingPage widget handles the layout and presentation of the landing page, making it visually appealing and functional.
