# Complete Example of Common UI Toolkit

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:common_ui_toolkit/common_ui_toolkit.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Common UI Toolkit Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Common UI Toolkit Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Using a CommonButton from the common_ui_toolkit
            CommonButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action when button is pressed
                showDialog(
                  context: context,
                  builder: (BuildContext context) {
                    return AlertDialog(
                      title: Text('Button Pressed'),
                      content: Text('You have pressed the button!'),
                      actions: <Widget>[
                        TextButton(
                          child: Text('OK'),
                          onPressed: () {
                            Navigator.of(context).pop();
                          },
                        ),
                      ],
                    );
                  },
                );
              },
              child: Text('Press Me'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Using a CommonCard from the common_ui_toolkit
            CommonCard(
              child: Padding(
                padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
                child: Text('This is a card from the common_ui_toolkit!'),
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The HomePage widget is set as the home screen of the app.
// 4. In HomePage, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the CommonButton and CommonCard vertically.
// 6. When the CommonButton is pressed, an AlertDialog is displayed, confirming the button press.
// 7. Below the button, a CommonCard is displayed with some text, showcasing another component from the toolkit.
