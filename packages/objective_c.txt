# Overview of the `objective_c` Flutter Package

The `objective_c` Flutter package is designed to facilitate the integration of Objective-C code within Flutter applications. This package is particularly useful for developers who need to leverage existing Objective-C libraries or APIs in their Flutter projects, allowing for a seamless blend of Flutter's UI capabilities with native iOS functionalities.

## When to Use This Package
- **Legacy Code Integration**: If you have existing Objective-C codebases that you want to incorporate into your Flutter app.
- **Native API Access**: When you need to access iOS-specific APIs that are not available in Flutter.
- **Performance Optimization**: For performance-critical tasks that can benefit from native execution.

## Key Features
- **Native Method Invocation**: Call Objective-C methods directly from Flutter.
- **Data Serialization**: Easily pass data between Flutter and Objective-C.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling mechanisms for native calls.
- **Platform-Specific Functionality**: Access to iOS-specific features that are not available in Flutter.

# Setting Up and Using the `objective_c` Package

## Installation
To use the `objective_c` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  objective_c: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/objective_c).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### iOS Configuration
1. **Update Podfile**: Ensure your `ios/Podfile` is set to use frameworks. You can do this by uncommenting the following line:
   ```ruby
   use_frameworks!
   ```

2. **Objective-C Bridging Header**: If you are using Swift in your project, you may need to create a bridging header to expose your Objective-C code to Swift. Create a file named `YourProjectName-Bridging-Header.h` and add the necessary imports.

### Android Configuration
Currently, the `objective_c` package is primarily focused on iOS. Ensure that your Android project is set up correctly, but the main functionalities will be utilized on iOS.

## Usage Example
Once you have installed the package and configured your project, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to call an Objective-C method from Flutter.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:objective_c/objective_c.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Objective-C Integration')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Call the Objective-C method
              String result = await ObjectiveC.callMethod('yourObjectiveCMethod');
              // Display the result
              print(result);
            },
            child: Text('Call Objective-C Method'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app with a button that, when pressed, calls an Objective-C method and prints the result.

# Complete Example of Using the `objective_c` Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:objective_c/objective_c.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Objective-C Integration')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Call the Objective-C method
              String result = await ObjectiveC.callMethod('yourObjectiveCMethod');
              // Display the result
              print(result);
            },
            child: Text('Call Objective-C Method'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the onPressed callback is triggered.
// 5. The callback calls the Objective-C method 'yourObjectiveCMethod' using the ObjectiveC.callMethod() function.
// 6. The result from the Objective-C method is awaited and printed to the console.
// 7. The user can see the result in the debug console, demonstrating the integration of Flutter with Objective-C.
