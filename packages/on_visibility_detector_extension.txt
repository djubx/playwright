In summary, the `on_visibility_detector_extension` package provides a simple way to track the visibility of a widget in Flutter. By wrapping the widget with the `VisibilityDetector` widget, you can receive callbacks when the widget becomes visible or invisible. The package works with both Android and iOS platforms and is easy to use.
