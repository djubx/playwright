# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Mirai Dropdown Menu

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **mirai_dropdown_menu** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the **mirai_dropdown_menu** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  mirai_dropdown_menu: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Mirai Dropdown Menu
Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in a Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to implement the dropdown menu.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mirai_dropdown_menu/mirai_dropdown_menu.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Mirai Dropdown Menu Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Mirai Dropdown Menu'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: DropdownMenuExample(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DropdownMenuExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DropdownMenuExampleState createState() => _DropdownMenuExampleState();
}

class _DropdownMenuExampleState extends State<DropdownMenuExample> {
  String? selectedValue;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MiraiDropdownMenu<String>(
      items: ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3'],
      onChanged: (value) {
        setState(() {
          selectedValue = value;
        });
      },
      hint: Text('Select an option'),
      value: selectedValue,
    );
  }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code
- **Import Statements**: We import the necessary packages, including `flutter/material.dart` for Flutter widgets and `mirai_dropdown_menu/mirai_dropdown_menu.dart` for the dropdown menu.
- **RealFlutter Class**: This is the main class of our application, which sets up the MaterialApp and the main scaffold.
- **DropdownMenuExample Class**: This stateful widget contains the dropdown menu. It maintains the selected value in its state.
- **MiraiDropdownMenu Widget**: This widget is where we define the dropdown menu. We provide a list of items, a callback for when an item is selected, a hint text, and the currently selected value.

With this setup, you can easily integrate the **mirai_dropdown_menu** into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Mirai Dropdown Menu

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mirai_dropdown_menu/mirai_dropdown_menu.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Mirai Dropdown Menu Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Mirai Dropdown Menu'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: DropdownMenuExample(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DropdownMenuExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DropdownMenuExampleState createState() => _DropdownMenuExampleState();
}

class _DropdownMenuExampleState extends State<DropdownMenuExample> {
  String? selectedValue; // Variable to hold the selected value

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MiraiDropdownMenu<String>(
      items: ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3'], // List of dropdown items
      onChanged: (value) {
        setState(() {
          selectedValue = value; // Update the selected value
        });
      },
      hint: Text('Select an option'), // Hint text displayed when no option is selected
      value: selectedValue, // Currently selected value
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the RealFlutter class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The home of the app is a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a centered DropdownMenuExample widget.
// 3. The DropdownMenuExample is a stateful widget that manages the state of the selected dropdown value.
// 4. Inside the build method, we create a MiraiDropdownMenu widget with a list of options.
// 5. When the user selects an option, the onChanged callback is triggered, updating the selectedValue state.
// 6. The dropdown menu displays the selected value or the hint text if no option is selected.
