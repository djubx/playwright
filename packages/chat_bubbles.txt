# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Chat Bubbles Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `chat_bubbles` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  chat_bubbles: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement chat bubbles in your app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:chat_bubbles/chat_bubbles.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Chat Bubbles Example')),
        body: ChatScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class ChatScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ListView(
      children: [
        BubbleNormal(
          text: "Hello, how are you?",
          isSender: true,
          color: Colors.blue,
          tail: true,
        ),
        BubbleNormal(
          text: "I'm good, thanks! How about you?",
          isSender: false,
          color: Colors.grey[300],
          tail: true,
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple chat interface with two chat bubbles. The `BubbleNormal` widget is used to create chat bubbles, where you can specify the text, sender status, color, and whether the bubble has a tail.

# Complete Example of Chat Bubbles in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:chat_bubbles/chat_bubbles.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Chat Bubbles Example')),
        body: ChatScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class ChatScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ListView(
      children: [
        // Creating a chat bubble for the sender
        BubbleNormal(
          text: "Hello, how are you?", // The message text
          isSender: true, // Indicates that this bubble is from the sender
          color: Colors.blue, // Color of the bubble
          tail: true, // Adds a tail to the bubble
        ),
        // Creating a chat bubble for the receiver
        BubbleNormal(
          text: "I'm good, thanks! How about you?", // The message text
          isSender: false, // Indicates that this bubble is from the receiver
          color: Colors.grey[300], // Color of the bubble
          tail: true, // Adds a tail to the bubble
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the app
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a ChatScreen.
// 3. The ChatScreen widget builds a ListView containing two chat bubbles.
// 4. The first bubble represents a message from the sender, styled with a blue background.
// 5. The second bubble represents a message from the receiver, styled with a grey background.
// 6. The bubbles are displayed in a vertical list, creating a simple chat interface.
