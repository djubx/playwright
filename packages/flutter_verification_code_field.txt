<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Flutter Verification Code Field Package

The `flutter_verification_code_field` package is a Flutter widget designed to facilitate the input of verification codes, commonly used in scenarios such as two-factor authentication (2FA) or account verification processes. This package provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to enter codes in a segmented manner, enhancing the overall user experience.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `flutter_verification_code_field` package in the following scenarios:

- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: When implementing 2FA in your application, this package can help users input their verification codes easily.
- **Account Verification**: For applications that require users to verify their accounts via SMS or email codes, this package simplifies the input process.
- **Payment Verification**: In scenarios where users need to enter a code to confirm a payment, this package can streamline the experience.

## Features

- **Customizable UI**: The package allows for extensive customization of the input fields, including colors, borders, and text styles.
- **Keyboard Type Support**: It supports different keyboard types, making it easier for users to enter numeric codes.
- **Auto-Focus and Auto-Submit**: The fields can automatically focus on the next input after a character is entered, and you can configure it to submit the code once all fields are filled.
- **Validation**: Built-in validation ensures that the input meets the expected format.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_verification_code_field

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_verification_code_field` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_verification_code_field: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_verification_code_field/flutter_verification_code_field.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

You can use the `VerificationCodeField` widget in your application as follows:

```dart
VerificationCodeField(
  length: 6, // Number of fields
  onCompleted: (String value) {
    // Handle the completed verification code
    print("Verification code entered: $value");
  },
  onChanged: (String value) {
    // Handle changes in the input
    print("Current input: $value");
  },
),
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` to allow for any necessary permissions, especially if you are using SMS for verification.

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to upload your profile picture.</string>
```

## Step 4: Customization

You can customize the appearance of the verification code fields by passing additional parameters:

```dart
VerificationCodeField(
  length: 6,
  cursorColor: Colors.blue,
  textStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, color: Colors.black),
  decoration: BoxDecoration(
    border: Border.all(color: Colors.grey),
    borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(10),
  ),
  onCompleted: (String value) {
    print("Verification code entered: $value");
  },
),
```

This customization allows you to match the verification code field with your app's theme.

# Complete Example of flutter_verification_code_field

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_verification_code_field/flutter_verification_code_field.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Verification Code Field Example',
      home: VerificationCodeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class VerificationCodeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _VerificationCodeScreenState createState() => _VerificationCodeScreenState();
}

class _VerificationCodeScreenState extends State<VerificationCodeScreen> {
  String verificationCode = ""; // Variable to hold the verification code

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Enter Verification Code'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Verification code input field
              VerificationCodeField(
                length: 6, // Number of fields for the verification code
                onCompleted: (String value) {
                  // This callback is triggered when the code is fully entered
                  setState(() {
                    verificationCode = value; // Update the verification code
                  });
                  // Here you can add your logic to verify the code
                  print("Verification code entered: $value");
                },
                onChanged: (String value) {
                  // This callback is triggered on each input change
                  print("Current input: $value");
                },
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between the input and button
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Action to perform when the button is pressed
                  if (verificationCode.length == 6) {
                    // Check if the verification code is complete
                    // Here you can add your logic to submit the code
                    print("Submitting verification code: $verificationCode");
                  } else {
                    // Show an error if the code is not complete
                    print("Please enter a complete verification code.");
                  }
                },
                child: Text('Submit Code'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The VerificationCodeScreen widget is displayed, containing a verification code input field and a submit button.
// 4. When the user enters the verification code, the onCompleted callback updates the verificationCode variable.
// 5. The user can press the submit button, which checks if the verification code is complete and prints it to the console.
```

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The app starts with the `main` function, which initializes the `RealFlutter` widget.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` widget builds a `MaterialApp` with a title and sets the home screen to `VerificationCodeScreen`.
// 3. Inside `VerificationCodeScreen`, a `VerificationCodeField` is displayed for the user to input their verification code.
// 4. As the user types, the `onCompleted` callback captures the full code, while `onChanged` captures each character input.
// 5. The user can submit the code by pressing the button, which checks if the code is complete and prints it to the console for further processing.
