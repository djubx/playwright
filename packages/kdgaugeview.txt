# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `kdgaugeview`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with `kdgaugeview`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  kdgaugeview: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/kdgaugeview).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Open the `Podfile` and uncomment the platform line, setting it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:kdgaugeview/kdgaugeview.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Gauge Widget

You can now use the `KDGaugeView` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
KDGaugeView(
  value: 75, // Current value
  minValue: 0, // Minimum value
  maxValue: 100, // Maximum value
  label: 'Battery Level', // Label for the gauge
  gaugeColor: Colors.green, // Color of the gauge
  backgroundColor: Colors.grey[300], // Background color
  animationDuration: Duration(seconds: 1), // Animation duration
),
```

This code snippet creates a gauge that represents a battery level of 75%. You can customize the `value`, `minValue`, `maxValue`, and other properties to fit your needs.

## Conclusion

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the `kdgaugeview` package into your Flutter application seamlessly. The package's flexibility and customization options make it a great choice for displaying gauge data effectively.

# Complete Example of Using `kdgaugeview`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:kdgaugeview/kdgaugeview.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'KDGaugeView Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: GaugeHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class GaugeHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _GaugeHomePageState createState() => _GaugeHomePageState();
}

class _GaugeHomePageState extends State<GaugeHomePage> {
  double _currentValue = 50; // Initial value for the gauge

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('KDGaugeView Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the gauge
            KDGaugeView(
              value: _currentValue, // Current value of the gauge
              minValue: 0, // Minimum value
              maxValue: 100, // Maximum value
              label: 'Battery Level', // Label for the gauge
              gaugeColor: Colors.green, // Color of the gauge
              backgroundColor: Colors.grey[300], // Background color
              animationDuration: Duration(seconds: 1), // Animation duration
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to increase the gauge value
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                setState(() {
                  // Increase the gauge value by 10
                  _currentValue = (_currentValue + 10) % 110; // Wrap around at 100
                });
              },
              child: Text('Increase Value'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme, and sets GaugeHomePage as the home.
// 3. GaugeHomePage is a stateful widget that maintains the current value of the gauge.
// 4. In the build method, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a KDGaugeView is displayed, showing the current value of the gauge.
// 6. An ElevatedButton is provided to increase the gauge value by 10 each time it is pressed.
// 7. The setState method is called to update the UI whenever the button is pressed, ensuring the gauge reflects the new value.
