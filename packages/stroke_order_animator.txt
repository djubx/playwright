# Stroke Order Animator Flutter Package

The `stroke_order_animator` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to help developers create engaging and interactive animations for stroke order demonstrations, particularly useful in educational applications for teaching languages like Chinese or Japanese. This package allows users to visualize the correct stroke order of characters, making it easier for learners to grasp the writing process.

## When to Use This Package

- **Language Learning Apps**: Ideal for applications focused on teaching writing in languages that use characters, such as Chinese or Japanese.
- **Educational Tools**: Useful in any educational context where visualizing the order of strokes is beneficial.
- **Interactive Games**: Can be integrated into games that involve character writing or drawing.

## Features

- **Customizable Animations**: Control the speed and style of the stroke animations.
- **Interactive Controls**: Users can pause, resume, or restart the animations.
- **Support for Multiple Characters**: Easily animate multiple characters in sequence.
- **Platform Compatibility**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

With these features, the `stroke_order_animator` package provides a comprehensive solution for developers looking to enhance their applications with stroke order animations.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Stroke Order Animator

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `stroke_order_animator` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  stroke_order_animator: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following permissions if required by your app's functionality:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the camera for scanning characters.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save images.</string>
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:stroke_order_animator/stroke_order_animator.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Stroke Order Animator

You can now use the `StrokeOrderAnimator` widget in your application. Here’s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
// Create a StatefulWidget to manage the animation state
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Define the characters to animate
  final List<String> characters = ['汉', '字']; // Example characters
  late StrokeOrderAnimator animator;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the animator with the characters
    animator = StrokeOrderAnimator(
      characters: characters,
      strokeColor: Colors.blue,
      strokeWidth: 5.0,
      duration: Duration(seconds: 2),
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Stroke Order Animator')),
      body: Center(
        child: animator, // Display the animator
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          // Restart the animation on button press
          animator.restart();
        },
        child: Icon(Icons.refresh),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a simple Flutter application that animates the stroke order of the specified characters. The floating action button allows users to restart the animation.

# Complete Example of Stroke Order Animator

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:stroke_order_animator/stroke_order_animator.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Define the characters to animate
  final List<String> characters = ['汉', '字']; // Example characters
  late StrokeOrderAnimator animator;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the animator with the characters
    animator = StrokeOrderAnimator(
      characters: characters,
      strokeColor: Colors.blue, // Set the stroke color
      strokeWidth: 5.0, // Set the stroke width
      duration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Set the duration of the animation
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Stroke Order Animator')),
      body: Center(
        child: animator, // Display the animator
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          // Restart the animation on button press
          animator.restart(); // Call the restart method to reset the animation
        },
        child: Icon(Icons.refresh), // Icon for the button
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The main function initializes the app
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Stroke Order Animator Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: RealFlutter(), // Set the home widget to RealFlutter
    );
  }
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation

// The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `MyApp` widget.
// `MyApp` sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// The home widget is `RealFlutter`, which is a StatefulWidget.
// In `RealFlutter`, we define a list of characters to animate.
// The `initState` method initializes the `StrokeOrderAnimator` with the characters, stroke color, width, and duration.
// The `build` method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget containing the animator.
// A FloatingActionButton is provided to restart the animation when pressed.
// The `StrokeOrderAnimator` handles the animation of the stroke order for the specified characters, providing an interactive learning experience for users.
