# Overview of the "mimecon" Flutter Package

The `mimecon` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that simplifies the process of handling MIME types in applications. MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) types are essential for defining the nature and format of files, which is particularly useful when dealing with file uploads, downloads, and content types in web applications.

## When to Use `mimecon`
- **File Uploads**: When you need to validate or process files based on their MIME types.
- **Content-Type Handling**: When working with APIs that require specific content types for requests.
- **File Type Detection**: When you want to determine the type of a file based on its extension or content.

## Key Features
- **MIME Type Detection**: Automatically detects the MIME type of a file based on its extension.
- **Extension Mapping**: Provides a comprehensive mapping of MIME types to file extensions and vice versa.
- **Custom MIME Types**: Allows users to define custom MIME types for specific use cases.

The `mimecon` package is particularly useful for applications that require robust file handling capabilities, making it a valuable addition to any Flutter project.

# Setting Up and Using the "mimecon" Package

## Installation
To add the `mimecon` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  mimecon: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if you are accessing files from the device storage.

## Basic Usage
Hereâ€™s how to use the `mimecon` package in your Flutter application:

1. Import the package:
   ```dart
   import 'package:mimecon/mimecon.dart';
   ```

2. Use the package to detect MIME types:
   ```dart
   String mimeType = MimeType.getMimeType('example.pdf'); // Returns 'application/pdf'
   ```

3. Get the file extension from a MIME type:
   ```dart
   String extension = MimeType.getExtension('application/pdf'); // Returns 'pdf'
   ```

This package makes it easy to manage MIME types, ensuring that your application can handle files correctly and efficiently.

# Complete Example of Using the "mimecon" Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mimecon/mimecon.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'MIME Type Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('MIME Type Detection'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: MimeTypeExample(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MimeTypeExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Example file names
    List<String> files = ['document.pdf', 'image.jpeg', 'audio.mp3', 'video.mp4'];

    return ListView.builder(
      itemCount: files.length,
      itemBuilder: (context, index) {
        String fileName = files[index];
        // Get the MIME type for the file
        String mimeType = MimeType.getMimeType(fileName);
        // Get the file extension from the MIME type
        String extension = MimeType.getExtension(mimeType);

        return ListTile(
          title: Text(fileName),
          subtitle: Text('MIME Type: $mimeType, Extension: $extension'),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold containing an AppBar and a centered MimeTypeExample widget.
// 3. The MimeTypeExample widget creates a ListView to display a list of file names.
// 4. For each file name, it retrieves the corresponding MIME type and file extension using the mimecon package.
// 5. Each file's name, MIME type, and extension are displayed in a ListTile within the ListView.
