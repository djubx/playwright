            Icon(CommunityMaterialIcons.alarm, size: 50),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The app starts by running the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// The MyApp widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a theme.
// The home of the MaterialApp is the MyHomePage widget.
// The MyHomePage widget builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// The body of the Scaffold is a Center widget with a Column child.
// The Column widget has three Icon children, each displaying a different icon from the community_material_icon package.
// The icons are displayed in the center of the screen, one below the other.

// In summary, this app displays three icons from the community_material_icon package in the center of the screen.
