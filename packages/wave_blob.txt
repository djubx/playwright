Setup and Usage
----------------

To use the `wave_blob` package, follow these steps:

1. Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  wave_blob: ^1.0.0
```
2. Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:wave_blob/wave_blob.dart';
```
3. Create a `WaveBlob` widget and customize its properties:
```dart
WaveBlob(
  waveColor: Colors.blue,
  waveOpacity: 0.5,
  waveSpeed: 2.0,
  waveAmplitude: 10.0,
  waveType: WaveType.sine,
)
```
Platform-Specific Details
-------------------------

* Android: No additional configuration is required.
* iOS: You need to add the following line to your `Info.plist` file:
```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
  <string>processing</string>
</array>
```
This allows the app to continue running in the background while the wave animation is active.

```dart

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Wave Blob Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        body: Center(
          child: WaveBlob(
            // Set the wave color to blue
            waveColor: Colors.blue,
            // Set the wave opacity to 50%
            waveOpacity: 0.5,
            // Set the wave speed to 2.0
            waveSpeed: 2.0,
            // Set the wave amplitude to 10.0
            waveAmplitude: 10.0,
            // Set the wave type to sine
            waveType: WaveType.sine,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The app starts by running the main function, which creates a RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold as its home.
// The Scaffold contains a Center widget, which centers its child horizontally and vertically.
// The child of the Center widget is a WaveBlob widget, which displays the wave animation.
// The WaveBlob widget is customized with various properties, such as wave color, opacity, speed, amplitude, and type.
// The wave animation is rendered on the screen, creating a visually appealing effect.
