# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Xtream Code Client

## Installation
To get started with the `xtream_code_client` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  xtream_code_client: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/xtream_code_client).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
Hereâ€™s how to use the `xtream_code_client` package in your Flutter application:

1. Import the package:

```dart
import 'package:xtream_code_client/xtream_code_client.dart';
```

2. Create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class to manage your IPTV connection:

```dart
class RealFlutter {
  final XtreamCodeClient client;

  RealFlutter(this.client);

  // Method to authenticate user
  Future<void> authenticate(String username, String password) async {
    try {
      await client.login(username, password);
      print('User authenticated successfully');
    } catch (e) {
      print('Authentication failed: $e');
    }
  }

  // Method to fetch channels
  Future<void> fetchChannels() async {
    try {
      final channels = await client.getLiveTV();
      print('Fetched channels: $channels');
    } catch (e) {
      print('Failed to fetch channels: $e');
    }
  }
}
```

This setup provides a basic structure for authenticating users and fetching channels from the Xtream Codes API.

# Complete Example of Using Xtream Code Client

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:xtream_code_client/xtream_code_client.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Xtream Code Client Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  final XtreamCodeClient client = XtreamCodeClient('your_api_url');
  final RealFlutter realFlutter;

  _HomeScreenState() : realFlutter = RealFlutter(client);

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Authenticate user on app start
    realFlutter.authenticate('username', 'password');
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Xtream Code Client Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () async {
            // Fetch channels when button is pressed
            await realFlutter.fetchChannels();
          },
          child: Text('Fetch Channels'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The HomeScreen widget is created, which initializes the XtreamCodeClient.
// 3. In the initState method, the user is authenticated using the RealFlutter class.
// 4. The UI displays a button that, when pressed, calls the fetchChannels method to retrieve the list of channels.
// 5. The fetched channels are printed to the console, demonstrating the successful integration of the Xtream Code Client.
