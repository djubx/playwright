# Setting Up and Using Cryptofont in Flutter

In this section, we'll walk through the process of setting up the `cryptofont` package in a Flutter project and demonstrate how to use it effectively.

## Setup Process

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `cryptofont` package under dependencies.

    ```yaml
    dependencies:
      flutter:
        sdk: flutter
      cryptofont: ^1.0.0
    ```

2. **Install Package**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the package.

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3. **Import Package**: In your Dart file, import the package to start using it.

    ```dart
    import 'package:cryptofont/cryptofont.dart';
    ```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

- Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to support all features of the package.

    ```gradle
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
    ```

### iOS

- No special configuration is required for iOS. Ensure your deployment target is set to iOS 9.0 or higher in your `ios/Podfile`.

    ```ruby
    platform :ios, '9.0'
    ```

## Using Cryptofont

To use an icon from the `cryptofont` package, you can utilize the `CryptoFontIcon` widget. Here's a simple example:

```dart
CryptoFontIcon(
  iconName: CryptoFontIcons.BTC,
  size: 24.0,
  color: Colors.orange,
)
```

This widget allows you to specify the icon name, size, and color, making it easy to integrate into your app's UI.

# Complete Example: Flutter Main File

Below is a complete example of a Flutter application using the `cryptofont` package. This example demonstrates how to display a list of cryptocurrency icons with their names.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cryptofont/cryptofont.dart';

// Main entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// RealFlutter is the main class of the application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Cryptofont Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: CryptoListScreen(), // Home screen of the app
    );
  }
}

// CryptoListScreen displays a list of cryptocurrencies with icons
class CryptoListScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final List<Map<String, dynamic>> cryptoList = [
    {'name': 'Bitcoin', 'icon': CryptoFontIcons.BTC},
    {'name': 'Ethereum', 'icon': CryptoFontIcons.ETH},
    {'name': 'Ripple', 'icon': CryptoFontIcons.XRP},
    // Add more cryptocurrencies as needed
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Cryptocurrency Icons'),
      ),
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: cryptoList.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          final crypto = cryptoList[index];
          return ListTile(
            leading: CryptoFontIcon(
              iconName: crypto['icon'],
              size: 32.0,
              color: Colors.black,
            ),
            title: Text(crypto['name']),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The application starts with the `main` function, which calls `runApp` with `RealFlutter`.
// `RealFlutter` is a stateless widget that sets up the MaterialApp.
// The home screen is set to `CryptoListScreen`, which displays a list of cryptocurrencies.
// `CryptoListScreen` uses a `ListView.builder` to create a scrollable list of ListTile widgets.
// Each ListTile contains a `CryptoFontIcon` and a Text widget displaying the cryptocurrency name.
// The `CryptoFontIcon` widget is used to display the icon for each cryptocurrency.
