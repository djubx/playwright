# Overview of the spinner_button Flutter Package

The `spinner_button` package is a versatile Flutter widget that combines the functionality of a button with a spinner, allowing users to indicate loading states while performing actions. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where a user action may take some time to complete, such as submitting a form or fetching data from an API. 

## When to Use `spinner_button`
- **Form Submissions**: When a user submits a form and you want to show a loading indicator.
- **Data Fetching**: When fetching data from a remote server and you want to prevent multiple submissions.
- **Long-Running Tasks**: For actions that take a noticeable amount of time, providing feedback to the user.

## Key Features
- **Customizable Spinner**: You can customize the spinner's appearance and behavior.
- **Loading State Management**: Automatically manages the loading state of the button.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate into existing Flutter applications with minimal setup.

Overall, the `spinner_button` package enhances user experience by providing visual feedback during asynchronous operations.

# Setting Up and Using the spinner_button Package

## Installation
To use the `spinner_button` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  spinner_button: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your application requires any specific capabilities. However, the `spinner_button` package does not require any special permissions.

## Basic Usage
To use the `spinner_button`, you can wrap it around your action logic. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:spinner_button/spinner_button.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  bool _isLoading = false;

  void _performAction() async {
    setState(() {
      _isLoading = true; // Set loading state to true
    });

    // Simulate a network request or long-running task
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));

    setState(() {
      _isLoading = false; // Set loading state to false
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Spinner Button Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: SpinnerButton(
          child: Text('Submit'),
          onTap: _isLoading ? null : _performAction, // Disable button when loading
          isLoading: _isLoading, // Pass loading state
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the button will show a spinner when the `_performAction` method is called, simulating a loading state for 2 seconds.

# Complete Example of spinner_button in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:spinner_button/spinner_button.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  bool _isLoading = false; // State variable to track loading status

  void _performAction() async {
    setState(() {
      _isLoading = true; // Set loading state to true when action starts
    });

    // Simulate a network request or long-running task
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2)); // Simulate delay

    setState(() {
      _isLoading = false; // Set loading state to false when action completes
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Spinner Button Example')), // App bar title
      body: Center(
        child: SpinnerButton(
          child: Text('Submit'), // Button text
          onTap: _isLoading ? null : _performAction, // Disable button when loading
          isLoading: _isLoading, // Pass loading state to spinner button
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The _isLoading variable is initialized to false.
// 3. When the user taps the button, the _performAction method is called.
// 4. The loading state is set to true, and the spinner is displayed.
// 5. A simulated delay of 2 seconds occurs to mimic a network request.
// 6. After the delay, the loading state is set back to false, hiding the spinner.
// 7. The button is re-enabled, allowing the user to perform the action again.
