void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Document Scanner Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(

  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {

}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  // Create an instance of the DocumentScanner class
  DocumentScanner scanner = DocumentScanner();

  // Store the scanned image
  Uint8List? scannedImage;

          children: <Widget>[
            // Display the scanned image
            if (scannedImage != null)
              Image.memory(scannedImage!),
            // Scan document button
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Call the scanDocument method
                scanner.scanDocument().then((image) {
                  // Store the scanned image
                  setState(() {
                    scannedImage = image;
                  });
                });
              },
              child: Text('Scan Document'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application flow:
// 1. The user clicks the "Scan Document" button.
// 2. The scanDocument method is called, which opens the camera.
// 3. The user takes a photo of the document.
// 4. The photo is processed and enhanced.
// 5. The processed image is returned to the app.
// 6. The app displays the scanned image.
```

// Summary: The code flows by first creating an instance of the DocumentScanner class. When the user clicks the "Scan Document" button, the scanDocument method is called, which opens the camera. The user takes a photo of the document, which is then processed and enhanced. The processed image is returned to the app, which displays the scanned image.
