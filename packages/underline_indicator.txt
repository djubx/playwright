In summary, the code flows as follows:

1. The user launches the app and sees the tab bar with three tabs.
2. The user selects a tab, and the underline indicator animates to the selected tab.
3. The user sees the content of the selected tab in the tab bar view.
4. The user can switch between tabs, and the underline indicator will animate accordingly.

The underline indicator is customizable, and the user can change its appearance by changing the `borderSide` property.
