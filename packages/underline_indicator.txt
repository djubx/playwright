# Complete Example of Underline Indicator

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:underline_indicator/underline_indicator.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: DefaultTabController(
        length: 3, // Define the number of tabs
        child: Scaffold(
          appBar: AppBar(
            title: Text('Underline Indicator Example'), // Title of the app
            bottom: TabBar(
              indicator: UnderlineIndicator(
                borderSide: BorderSide(
                  width: 3.0, // Set the thickness of the underline
                  color: Colors.blue, // Set the color of the underline
                ),
                insets: EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 16.0), // Set padding around the underline
              ),
              tabs: [
                Tab(text: 'Tab 1'), // First tab
                Tab(text: 'Tab 2'), // Second tab
                Tab(text: 'Tab 3'), // Third tab
              ],
            ),
          ),
          body: TabBarView(
            children: [
              Center(child: Text('Content for Tab 1')), // Content for the first tab
              Center(child: Text('Content for Tab 2')), // Content for the second tab
              Center(child: Text('Content for Tab 3')), // Content for the third tab
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. A MaterialApp is created, which serves as the root of the application.
// 3. A DefaultTabController is used to manage the state of the tabs, with a specified length of 3.
// 4. The AppBar contains a title and a TabBar, which uses the UnderlineIndicator for its indicator.
// 5. The UnderlineIndicator is customized with a blue color and a thickness of 3.0.
// 6. The TabBar has three tabs, each labeled accordingly.
// 7. The body of the Scaffold contains a TabBarView, which displays different content for each tab.
// 8. When a tab is selected, the corresponding content is displayed in the TabBarView.
