Here's a detailed technical blog on the "logman" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Logman Flutter Package

The **Logman** package is a powerful logging utility for Flutter applications that simplifies the process of logging messages, errors, and other important information during development and production. It provides a flexible and easy-to-use interface for managing logs, making it an essential tool for developers looking to enhance their debugging and monitoring capabilities.

## When to Use Logman

You should consider using the Logman package in scenarios such as:
- **Debugging**: When you need to track down issues in your application, Logman allows you to log messages at various levels (info, warning, error).
- **Monitoring**: In production applications, logging can help you monitor the health of your app and track user behavior.
- **Analytics**: You can log specific events to analyze user interactions and improve the user experience.

## Features

- **Multiple Log Levels**: Supports various log levels (info, debug, warning, error) to categorize log messages.
- **Custom Log Format**: Allows customization of log message formats to suit your needs.
- **File Logging**: Option to log messages to a file for persistent storage and later analysis.
- **Console Logging**: Easily view logs in the console during development.
- **Filter Logs**: Ability to filter logs based on severity levels.

With these features, Logman provides a comprehensive solution for logging in Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Logman

## Step 1: Adding Logman to Your Project

To get started with Logman, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  logman: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you plan to log to files or access specific resources. Add the following lines if necessary:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library for logging purposes.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using Logman in Your Application

Now that you have set up Logman, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to log messages.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:logman/logman.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Logman Example',
      home: LogExample(),
    );
  }
}

class LogExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _LogExampleState createState() => _LogExampleState();
}

class _LogExampleState extends State<LogExample> {
  final Logman logman = Logman();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    logman.info('LogExample initialized');
  }

  void _logMessage() {
    logman.debug('This is a debug message');
    logman.warning('This is a warning message');
    logman.error('This is an error message');
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Logman Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _logMessage,
          child: Text('Log Messages'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that logs messages when a button is pressed.

# Complete Example of Logman in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:logman/logman.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// MyApp is the root widget of the application
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Logman Example',
      home: LogExample(),
    );
  }
}

// LogExample is a StatefulWidget that demonstrates logging
class LogExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _LogExampleState createState() => _LogExampleState();
}

class _LogExampleState extends State<LogExample> {
  // Create an instance of Logman for logging
  final Logman logman = Logman();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Log an info message when the widget is initialized
    logman.info('LogExample initialized');
  }

  // Method to log different types of messages
  void _logMessage() {
    logman.debug('This is a debug message'); // Log a debug message
    logman.warning('This is a warning message'); // Log a warning message
    logman.error('This is an error message'); // Log an error message
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Logman Example'), // Title of the app bar
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _logMessage, // Call _logMessage when pressed
          child: Text('Log Messages'), // Button text
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds the MaterialApp with a title and home set to LogExample.
// 3. LogExample initializes its state and logs an info message.
// 4. When the button is pressed, _logMessage is called.
// 5. _logMessage logs a debug, warning, and error message using Logman.
```
