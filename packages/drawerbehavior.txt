```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:drawerbehavior/drawerbehavior.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Create a DrawerScaffoldController to control the drawer
  final _drawerScaffoldController = DrawerScaffoldController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a DrawerScaffold widget
    return DrawerScaffold(
      // Create a controller for the DrawerScaffold
      controller: _drawerScaffoldController,
      // Create an AppBar widget
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('DrawerBehavior Demo'),
      ),
      // Create a Drawer widget
      drawer: Drawer(
        child: Center(
          child: Text('Drawer content'),
        ),
      ),
      // Create a body for the DrawerScaffold
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Body content'),
      ),
      // Add a floating action button to toggle the drawer
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          // Toggle the drawer
          _drawerScaffoldController.toggle();
        },
        tooltip: 'Toggle drawer',
        child: Icon(Icons.menu),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user opens the app and sees the body content.
// 2. The user clicks the floating action button to toggle the drawer.
// 3. The drawer slides in from the left side of the screen.
// 4. The user sees the drawer content and can interact with it.
// 5. The user clicks the floating action button again to toggle the drawer.
// 6. The drawer slides out of the screen and the user sees the body content again.

// This code demonstrates the basic usage of the DrawerBehavior package.
// It creates a DrawerScaffold widget with a Drawer and a body, and adds a floating action button to toggle the drawer.
// The application flow is controlled by the DrawerScaffoldController.
