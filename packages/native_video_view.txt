# Native Video View Flutter Package

The `native_video_view` Flutter package is a powerful tool for integrating native video playback capabilities into Flutter applications. It provides a seamless way to display videos using the platform's native video player, ensuring optimal performance and user experience. This package is particularly useful when you need advanced video features that are not available in Flutter's built-in video players.

## When to Use `native_video_view`

You should consider using the `native_video_view` package in scenarios such as:

- **High-Performance Video Playback**: When you need smooth playback of high-resolution videos.
- **Platform-Specific Features**: If you want to leverage native features like picture-in-picture, background playback, or advanced controls that are not available in Flutter's standard video players.
- **Custom Video Controls**: When you need to create a custom user interface for video playback that requires native performance.

## Features

- **Native Performance**: Utilizes the platform's native video player for optimal performance.
- **Customizable Controls**: Allows for the creation of custom video controls.
- **Support for Multiple Platforms**: Works on both Android and iOS, providing a consistent API across platforms.
- **Event Handling**: Provides callbacks for various video events, such as playback completion, errors, and buffering.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `native_video_view`

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `native_video_view` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `native_video_view` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  native_video_view: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/native_video_view).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update Android Manifest**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

2. **Enable ProGuard**: If you are using ProGuard, ensure that you add the necessary rules to keep the native video player classes.

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. **Podfile**: Ensure your `ios/Podfile` is set to use frameworks:

   ```ruby
   use_frameworks!
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in a Flutter application.

1. **Import the Package**:

   ```dart
   import 'package:native_video_view/native_video_view.dart';
   ```

2. **Create a Video Player Widget**:

   You can create a simple video player widget using the `NativeVideoView` class. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

   ```dart
   class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return Scaffold(
         appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Native Video View Example')),
         body: Center(
           child: NativeVideoView(
             url: 'https://www.example.com/video.mp4',
             autoPlay: true,
             onVideoFinished: () {
               print('Video playback finished');
             },
           ),
         ),
       );
     }
   }
   ```

This example demonstrates how to create a simple video player that plays a video from a URL and prints a message when the video finishes playing.

# Complete Example of Using `native_video_view`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:native_video_view/native_video_view.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Native Video View Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Video controller to manage video playback
  late NativeVideoController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the video controller
    _controller = NativeVideoController();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the video controller when the widget is removed from the widget tree
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Native Video View Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: NativeVideoView(
          controller: _controller,
          url: 'https://www.example.com/video.mp4', // URL of the video
          autoPlay: true, // Automatically play the video
          onVideoFinished: () {
            // Callback when the video finishes playing
            print('Video playback finished');
          },
          onError: (error) {
            // Handle any errors during video playback
            print('Error: $error');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home widget as RealFlutter.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that manages the video playback state.
// 4. In the initState method, we initialize the NativeVideoController.
// 5. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a NativeVideoView widget.
// 6. The NativeVideoView widget is configured with the video URL, autoPlay option, and callbacks for video finish and error events.
// 7. When the video finishes playing, a message is printed to the console.
// 8. The dispose method ensures that the video controller is properly disposed of when the widget is removed from the widget tree.
```
