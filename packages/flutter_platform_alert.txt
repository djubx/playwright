# Flutter Platform Alert Package

The `flutter_platform_alert` package is a Flutter plugin that provides a simple way to display platform-specific alert dialogs. This package is particularly useful when you want to maintain a native look and feel for alerts across different platforms (iOS and Android) without having to write separate code for each platform.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `flutter_platform_alert` package when:
- You need to show alerts that conform to the design guidelines of the respective platforms.
- You want to avoid the complexity of managing platform-specific code for alerts.
- You require a consistent user experience across both iOS and Android.

## Features
- **Native Look and Feel**: Automatically adapts to the platform's design.
- **Customizable**: Allows for customization of alert titles, messages, and button texts.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple API for displaying alerts with minimal setup.

## Example Use Cases
- Displaying confirmation dialogs for user actions (e.g., deleting an item).
- Showing error messages or warnings in a user-friendly manner.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_platform_alert

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_platform_alert` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_platform_alert: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions if they are not already present:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration
For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you plan to use alerts that require user permissions (like location). Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show nearby places.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Here’s a simple example of how to display an alert.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_platform_alert/flutter_platform_alert.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Platform Alert Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Displaying a platform alert
              await FlutterPlatformAlert.showAlert(
                title: 'Alert Title',
                message: 'This is an alert message.',
                alertStyle: AlertButtonStyle.ok,
              );
            },
            child: Text('Show Alert'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, an alert dialog will be displayed with a title and message.

# Complete Example of flutter_platform_alert

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_platform_alert/flutter_platform_alert.dart';

// Main class of the application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Platform Alert Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Displaying a platform alert when the button is pressed
              await FlutterPlatformAlert.showAlert(
                title: 'Alert Title', // Title of the alert
                message: 'This is an alert message.', // Message displayed in the alert
                alertStyle: AlertButtonStyle.ok, // Style of the alert button
              );
            },
            child: Text('Show Alert'), // Button text
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the RealFlutter app
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
3. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is created.
4. When the button is pressed, the onPressed callback is triggered.
5. The FlutterPlatformAlert.showAlert() method is called to display an alert dialog with a title and message.
6. The user can acknowledge the alert by pressing the OK button, which dismisses the dialog.
