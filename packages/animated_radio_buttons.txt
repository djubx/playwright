# Complete Example of Animated Radio Buttons

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_radio_buttons/animated_radio_buttons.dart'; // Import the package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the main app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to hold the selected value
  String? _selectedValue;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animated Radio Buttons Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Animated Radio Buttons'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Animated Radio Buttons
              AnimatedRadioButtons<String>(
                options: ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3'], // Define options
                selectedValue: _selectedValue, // Bind selected value
                onChanged: (value) {
                  setState(() {
                    _selectedValue = value; // Update selected value
                  });
                },
                // Customize the appearance
                activeColor: Colors.blue,
                inactiveColor: Colors.grey,
                buttonHeight: 50.0,
                buttonWidth: 200.0,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Add space
              // Display selected value
              Text(
                _selectedValue != null ? 'Selected: $_selectedValue' : 'No option selected',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
// Explanation of the application flow:

// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the selected radio button.
// 3. The _selectedValue variable holds the currently selected option.
// 4. In the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, an AnimatedRadioButtons widget is used to display the radio buttons.
// 6. The options for the radio buttons are defined as a list of strings.
// 7. The selectedValue property is bound to the _selectedValue variable, and the onChanged callback updates this variable when a button is selected.
// 8. The appearance of the buttons is customized with activeColor, inactiveColor, buttonHeight, and buttonWidth.
// 9. Below the radio buttons, a Text widget displays the currently selected option or a message indicating that no option is selected.
