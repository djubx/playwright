# Setting Up and Using flutter_custom_utils

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_custom_utils` package and demonstrate how to use its features effectively.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_custom_utils` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_custom_utils: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the package to start using its features:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_custom_utils/flutter_custom_utils.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now utilize the various utilities provided by the package. For example, to validate an email address and format a date, you can do the following:

```dart
String email = "example@example.com";
bool isValidEmail = EmailValidator.validate(email);

DateTime now = DateTime.now();
String formattedDate = DateFormatter.format(now);
```

This is just a glimpse of what you can achieve with the `flutter_custom_utils` package. Explore the documentation for more utilities and widgets.

# Complete Example of flutter_custom_utils

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_custom_utils/flutter_custom_utils.dart'; // Importing the custom utils package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the main application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Custom Utils Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(), // Setting the home page of the app
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomePageState createState() => _HomePageState();
}

class _HomePageState extends State<HomePage> {
  final TextEditingController _emailController = TextEditingController(); // Controller for email input
  String _emailValidationMessage = ''; // Variable to hold validation message

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Custom Utils Example'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              controller: _emailController, // Binding the controller to the text field
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Enter your email',
                errorText: _emailValidationMessage.isEmpty ? null : _emailValidationMessage, // Displaying validation message
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _validateEmail, // Calling the validation function on button press
              child: Text('Validate Email'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text('Current Date: ${DateFormatter.format(DateTime.now())}'), // Displaying the formatted current date
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void _validateEmail() {
    String email = _emailController.text; // Getting the email from the text field
    if (EmailValidator.validate(email)) {
      setState(() {
        _emailValidationMessage = 'Valid Email!'; // Setting validation message for valid email
      });
    } else {
      setState(() {
        _emailValidationMessage = 'Invalid Email!'; // Setting validation message for invalid email
      });
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme, and specifies HomePage as the home widget.
// 3. HomePage is a stateful widget that contains a TextField for email input and a button to validate the email.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the _validateEmail method is called, which checks the validity of the email using EmailValidator.
// 5. The validation message is displayed below the TextField based on the result of the validation.
// 6. The current date is displayed in a formatted manner using DateFormatter.
```
