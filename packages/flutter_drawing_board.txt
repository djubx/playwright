# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Flutter Drawing Board

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_drawing_board` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_drawing_board: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the current version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you plan to save images to the device:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to save your drawings.</string>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the drawing board.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_drawing_board/flutter_drawing_board.dart';
```

2. Create a StatefulWidget to manage the drawing state:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Initialize the DrawingController
  final DrawingController _drawingController = DrawingController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Drawing Board'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          Expanded(
            child: DrawingBoard(
              controller: _drawingController,
              background: Colors.white,
            ),
          ),
          // Add buttons for actions like save, clear, etc.
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Add functionality for saving and clearing drawings as needed.

This setup provides a basic drawing board where users can draw on a white canvas.

# Complete Example of Flutter Drawing Board

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_drawing_board/flutter_drawing_board.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Initialize the DrawingController to manage drawing actions
  final DrawingController _drawingController = DrawingController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Drawing Board'),
          actions: [
            IconButton(
              icon: Icon(Icons.save),
              onPressed: () {
                // Save the drawing as an image
                _drawingController.save().then((value) {
                  // Handle the saved image (e.g., share or display)
                });
              },
            ),
            IconButton(
              icon: Icon(Icons.clear),
              onPressed: () {
                // Clear the drawing board
                _drawingController.clear();
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
        body: Column(
          children: [
            Expanded(
              child: DrawingBoard(
                controller: _drawingController,
                background: Colors.white, // Set the background color
              ),
            ),
            // Additional UI elements can be added here
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and runs MyApp.
// 2. MyApp creates a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a DrawingBoard.
// 3. The DrawingController manages the drawing state and actions.
// 4. The AppBar has buttons to save the drawing and clear the board.
// 5. When the save button is pressed, the current drawing is saved as an image.
// 6. When the clear button is pressed, the drawing board is cleared for a new drawing.
```
