class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Double Tap Video Player')),
        body: Center(
          child: DoubleTapPlayerView(
            videoUrl: 'https://www.example.com/video.mp4', // Replace with your video URL
            aspectRatio: 16 / 9, // Set the aspect ratio for the video
            onDoubleTap: () {
              // Handle double tap event
              print('Video double-tapped!'); // Log the double tap event
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

/*
  Application Flow Explanation:
  
  1. The app starts with the main function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
  2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
  3. Inside the Center widget, a DoubleTapPlayerView is created, which takes a video URL and an aspect ratio.
  4. The onDoubleTap callback is defined to handle double-tap events, where it prints a message to the console.
  5. When the user double-taps on the video player, the onDoubleTap function is triggered, providing a responsive interaction.
  6. The video player will automatically handle video playback, allowing users to enjoy the content seamlessly.
