Here's a detailed technical blog on the "cached_value" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Cached Value Flutter Package

The `cached_value` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to simplify the management of cached data in Flutter applications. It provides a straightforward way to store and retrieve values that can be expensive to compute or fetch, ensuring that your app remains responsive and efficient.

## When to Use

You should consider using the `cached_value` package in scenarios such as:

- **API Calls**: When fetching data from a remote server, caching the result can significantly reduce load times and improve user experience.
- **Expensive Computations**: If your application performs heavy calculations, caching the results can save processing time on subsequent requests.
- **State Management**: It can be used to cache state values that do not change frequently, reducing the need for unnecessary rebuilds.

## Features

- **Simple API**: The package offers an easy-to-use API for caching values.
- **Automatic Expiration**: You can set expiration times for cached values, ensuring that stale data is not used.
- **Thread Safety**: The package is designed to be thread-safe, making it suitable for multi-threaded applications.

In summary, the `cached_value` package is an essential tool for Flutter developers looking to optimize their applications by efficiently managing cached data.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Cached Value

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `cached_value` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  cached_value: ^1.0.0
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter and the `cached_value` package. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to cache a value:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cached_value/cached_value.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a CachedValue instance
    final cachedValue = CachedValue<String>(
      fetch: () async {
        // Simulate a network call
        await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));
        return 'Fetched Data';
      },
      expiration: Duration(seconds: 10), // Cache expires in 10 seconds
    );

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Cached Value Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: FutureBuilder<String>(
            future: cachedValue.value, // Get the cached value
            builder: (context, snapshot) {
              if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                return CircularProgressIndicator(); // Show loading indicator
              } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
                return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}'); // Show error message
              } else {
                return Text('Data: ${snapshot.data}'); // Show fetched data
              }
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a `CachedValue` instance that fetches data asynchronously. The data is cached for 10 seconds, after which it will be fetched again if requested.

# Complete Example of Cached Value in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cached_value/cached_value.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a CachedValue instance
    final cachedValue = CachedValue<String>(
      fetch: () async {
        // Simulate a network call
        await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));
        return 'Fetched Data';
      },
      expiration: Duration(seconds: 10), // Cache expires in 10 seconds
    );

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Cached Value Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: FutureBuilder<String>(
            future: cachedValue.value, // Get the cached value
            builder: (context, snapshot) {
              if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                return CircularProgressIndicator(); // Show loading indicator
              } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
                return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}'); // Show error message
              } else {
                return Text('Data: ${snapshot.data}'); // Show fetched data
              }
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. Inside the RealFlutter widget, a CachedValue instance is created.
// 3. The fetch function simulates a network call that takes 2 seconds to complete.
// 4. The CachedValue is set to expire after 10 seconds.
// 5. A FutureBuilder is used to handle the asynchronous fetching of the cached value.
// 6. While waiting for the data, a CircularProgressIndicator is displayed.
// 7. If an error occurs during fetching, an error message is shown.
// 8. Once the data is fetched, it is displayed on the screen.
```
