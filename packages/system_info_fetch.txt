# Exploring the `system_info_fetch` Flutter Package

The `system_info_fetch` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to gather system-related information from the device on which their application is running. This package provides a straightforward API to fetch details such as the operating system, device model, CPU architecture, and more. 

## When to Use This Package
You might want to use `system_info_fetch` in scenarios such as:
- Displaying device information in your app settings.
- Collecting analytics data about the devices your app is running on.
- Adapting your app's behavior based on the device's capabilities.

## Key Features
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Comprehensive System Information**: Fetches a variety of system details including:
  - Operating System version
  - Device model
  - CPU architecture
  - Memory information
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that integrates easily into existing Flutter applications.

# Setting Up and Using the `system_info_fetch` Package

## Installation
To get started with the `system_info_fetch` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  system_info_fetch: ^0.2.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you plan to access sensitive information. However, `system_info_fetch` does not require any specific permissions for basic system information.

## Using the Package
Once the package is installed, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to fetch and display system information.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:system_info_fetch/system_info_fetch.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('System Info Fetch Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: FutureBuilder<Map<String, dynamic>>(
            future: _fetchSystemInfo(),
            builder: (context, snapshot) {
              if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                return CircularProgressIndicator();
              } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
                return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}');
              } else {
                return Text('System Info: ${snapshot.data}');
              }
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  Future<Map<String, dynamic>> _fetchSystemInfo() async {
    // Fetching system information
    final os = await SysInfoFetch.os;
    final osVersion = await SysInfoFetch.osVersion;
    final deviceModel = await SysInfoFetch.deviceModel;
    final cpuArchitecture = await SysInfoFetch.cpuArchitecture;

    // Returning the fetched information as a map
    return {
      'OS': os,
      'OS Version': osVersion,
      'Device Model': deviceModel,
      'CPU Architecture': cpuArchitecture,
    };
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Using `system_info_fetch`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:system_info_fetch/system_info_fetch.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('System Info Fetch Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: FutureBuilder<Map<String, dynamic>>(
            future: _fetchSystemInfo(), // Initiating the fetch of system info
            builder: (context, snapshot) {
              if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                return CircularProgressIndicator(); // Show loading indicator while fetching
              } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
                return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}'); // Display error if any
              } else {
                return Text('System Info: ${snapshot.data}'); // Display fetched system info
              }
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  Future<Map<String, dynamic>> _fetchSystemInfo() async {
    // Fetching system information
    final os = await SysInfoFetch.os; // Get the operating system
    final osVersion = await SysInfoFetch.osVersion; // Get the OS version
    final deviceModel = await SysInfoFetch.deviceModel; // Get the device model
    final cpuArchitecture = await SysInfoFetch.cpuArchitecture; // Get the CPU architecture

    // Returning the fetched information as a map
    return {
      'OS': os,
      'OS Version': osVersion,
      'Device Model': deviceModel,
      'CPU Architecture': cpuArchitecture,
    };
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. A MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, a FutureBuilder is used to handle the asynchronous fetching of system information.
// 4. The _fetchSystemInfo method is called, which retrieves various system details.
// 5. While the data is being fetched, a CircularProgressIndicator is displayed.
// 6. If an error occurs during fetching, it is displayed on the screen.
// 7. Once the data is successfully fetched, it is displayed in a Text widget.
