# Complete Example of Using Line Icons

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:line_icons/line_icons.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Line Icons Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Line Icons in Flutter'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying a home icon
              Icon(LineIcons.home, size: 50, color: Colors.blue),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              // Displaying a settings icon
              Icon(LineIcons.settings, size: 50, color: Colors.green),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              // Displaying a user icon
              Icon(LineIcons.user, size: 50, color: Colors.red),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the icons vertically.
// 5. Each Icon widget uses a different line icon from the line_icons package, with specified sizes and colors.
// 6. SizedBox widgets are used to add spacing between the icons for better visual separation.
