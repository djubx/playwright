<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pro_image_editor/pro_image_editor.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Pro Image Editor Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: ImageEditorScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ImageEditorScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ImageEditorScreenState createState() => _ImageEditorScreenState();
}

class _ImageEditorScreenState extends State<ImageEditorScreen> {
  // Variable to hold the selected image
  Image? _image;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Image Editor'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the selected image or a placeholder
            _image != null
                ? _image!
                : Text('No image selected.'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _editImage,
              child: Text('Edit Image'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to edit the image
  void _editImage() async {
    // Load an image from the gallery
    final image = await ProImageEditor.pickImage();
    if (image != null) {
      // Open the image editor
      final editedImage = await ProImageEditor.editImage(image);
      if (editedImage != null) {
        // Update the state with the edited image
        setState(() {
          _image = Image.file(editedImage);
        });
      }
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The home screen is the ImageEditorScreen, which contains the main UI.
// 3. The UI displays either the selected image or a placeholder text.
// 4. When the "Edit Image" button is pressed, the _editImage function is called.
// 5. This function allows the user to pick an image from the gallery.
// 6. Once an image is selected, the image editor is opened for editing.
// 7. After editing, the edited image is displayed on the screen.
```
