# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Timezone Dropdown Plus

## Installation
To get started with `timezone_dropdown_plus`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  timezone_dropdown_plus: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/timezone_dropdown_plus).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` if you are accessing location services to detect the user's time zone automatically:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to set the time zone automatically.</string>
```

## Usage
To use the `timezone_dropdown_plus` package, you can create a simple dropdown widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s how to implement it:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:timezone_dropdown_plus/timezone_dropdown_plus.dart';
```

2. Use the `TimezoneDropdown` widget in your widget tree:

```dart
TimezoneDropdown(
  onChanged: (String? newValue) {
    // Handle the selected time zone
    print("Selected Time Zone: $newValue");
  },
)
```

This will create a dropdown that allows users to select their time zone, and you can handle the selection in the `onChanged` callback.

# Complete Example of Timezone Dropdown Plus

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:timezone_dropdown_plus/timezone_dropdown_plus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Timezone Dropdown Plus Example',
      home: TimezoneSelectionScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class TimezoneSelectionScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _TimezoneSelectionScreenState createState() => _TimezoneSelectionScreenState();
}

class _TimezoneSelectionScreenState extends State<TimezoneSelectionScreen> {
  String? selectedTimezone; // Variable to hold the selected time zone

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Select Your Time Zone'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Timezone dropdown widget
            TimezoneDropdown(
              onChanged: (String? newValue) {
                setState(() {
                  selectedTimezone = newValue; // Update the selected time zone
                });
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Add some spacing
            // Display the selected time zone
            Text(
              selectedTimezone != null
                  ? 'Selected Time Zone: $selectedTimezone'
                  : 'No Time Zone Selected',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The TimezoneSelectionScreen is a stateful widget that maintains the selected time zone.
// 4. Inside the build method, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. The Center widget contains a Column that holds the TimezoneDropdown and a Text widget.
// 6. When a user selects a time zone from the dropdown, the onChanged callback is triggered.
// 7. The selected time zone is stored in the selectedTimezone variable and displayed below the dropdown.
