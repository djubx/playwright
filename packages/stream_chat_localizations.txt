# Tutorial: Setting Up Stream Chat Localizations

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `stream_chat_localizations` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

First, add the `stream_chat_localizations` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  stream_chat_localizations: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/stream_chat_localizations).

## Step 2: Configure Localization

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file includes the following:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        // Add this line to support localization
        resConfigs "en", "es", "fr" // Add other languages as needed
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to add the supported languages in your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>CFBundleLocalizations</key>
<array>
    <string>en</string>
    <string>es</string>
    <string>fr</string>
    <!-- Add other languages as needed -->
</array>
```

## Step 3: Initialize Localization

In your main application file, initialize the localization support. Here’s how you can do it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:stream_chat_localizations/stream_chat_localizations.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      localizationsDelegates: [
        StreamChatLocalizations.delegate,
        GlobalMaterialLocalizations.delegate,
        GlobalWidgetsLocalizations.delegate,
        GlobalCupertinoLocalizations.delegate,
      ],
      supportedLocales: [
        const Locale('en', ''), // English
        const Locale('es', ''), // Spanish
        const Locale('fr', ''), // French
        // Add other locales as needed
      ],
      home: ChatScreen(),
    );
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Using Localized Strings

To use the localized strings in your chat application, you can access them through the `StreamChatLocalizations` class. Here’s an example of how to display a localized message:

```dart
class ChatScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text(StreamChatLocalizations.of(context).chatTitle),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(StreamChatLocalizations.of(context).welcomeMessage),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

With these steps, you have successfully set up the `stream_chat_localizations` package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Stream Chat Localizations

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:stream_chat_localizations/stream_chat_localizations.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      // Setting up localization delegates
      localizationsDelegates: [
        StreamChatLocalizations.delegate, // Delegate for Stream Chat Localizations
        GlobalMaterialLocalizations.delegate, // Material localization
        GlobalWidgetsLocalizations.delegate, // Widget localization
        GlobalCupertinoLocalizations.delegate, // Cupertino localization
      ],
      supportedLocales: [
        const Locale('en', ''), // English
        const Locale('es', ''), // Spanish
        const Locale('fr', ''), // French
        // Add other locales as needed
      ],
      home: ChatScreen(), // Main chat screen
    );
  }
}

class ChatScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text(StreamChatLocalizations.of(context).chatTitle), // Localized title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(StreamChatLocalizations.of(context).welcomeMessage), // Localized welcome message
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with localization delegates and supported locales.
// 3. The ChatScreen is set as the home screen of the app.
// 4. In ChatScreen, the AppBar title and body text are populated with localized strings using StreamChatLocalizations.
// 5. The app will display the chat title and welcome message based on the user's selected language.
