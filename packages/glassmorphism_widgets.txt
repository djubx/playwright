<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Glassmorphism Widgets Flutter Package

The **glassmorphism_widgets** package for Flutter is a powerful tool that allows developers to create visually appealing user interfaces with a glass-like effect. This design trend, known as glassmorphism, is characterized by a frosted glass appearance, which can add depth and elegance to your applications. 

## When to Use This Package
You might consider using the glassmorphism_widgets package when:
- You want to enhance the aesthetic appeal of your app with modern design trends.
- You are developing applications that require a layered interface, such as dashboards or media players.
- You want to create a unique user experience that stands out from traditional flat designs.

## Features
- **Frosted Glass Effect**: Easily apply a frosted glass effect to your widgets.
- **Customizable**: Adjust the blur intensity, color, and opacity to fit your design needs.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across different screen sizes and orientations.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal performance overhead, ensuring smooth animations and transitions.

With these features, the glassmorphism_widgets package is an excellent choice for developers looking to implement modern UI designs in their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Glassmorphism Widgets Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the glassmorphism_widgets package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  glassmorphism_widgets: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable the `uses` key in your `Info.plist` file to allow for the necessary permissions. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>audio</string>
</array>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a glassmorphic card.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:glassmorphism_widgets/glassmorphism_widgets.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: Center(
          child: GlassContainer(
            width: 300,
            height: 200,
            blur: 10,
            borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(20),
            child: Center(
              child: Text(
                'Glassmorphism Effect',
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a `GlassContainer` that displays a text label with a glassmorphic effect. You can customize the `blur`, `borderRadius`, and other properties to achieve the desired look.

# Complete Example of Glassmorphism Widgets

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:glassmorphism_widgets/glassmorphism_widgets.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Glassmorphism Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Glassmorphism Widgets'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: GlassContainer(
            // Creating a glassmorphic container
            width: 300,
            height: 200,
            blur: 10, // Setting the blur effect
            borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(20), // Rounding the corners
            child: Center(
              child: Text(
                'Glassmorphism Effect',
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the main UI.
// 3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a title and theme.
// 4. A Scaffold widget is used to provide the basic structure, including an AppBar.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 6. Inside the Center widget, a GlassContainer is created, which applies the glassmorphism effect.
// 7. The GlassContainer has a specified width, height, blur effect, and rounded corners.
// 8. Finally, a Text widget is centered within the GlassContainer, displaying the message "Glassmorphism Effect".
