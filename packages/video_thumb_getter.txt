# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using video_thumb_getter

## Installation
To get started with the `video_thumb_getter` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  video_thumb_getter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/video_thumb_getter).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following keys to request permission for accessing the photo library:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to extract video thumbnails.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to save thumbnails.</string>
```

## Using the Package
Once you have installed the package and configured your project, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to extract a thumbnail from a video file.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:video_thumb_getter/video_thumb_getter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Video Thumbnail Getter')),
        body: Center(
          child: FutureBuilder(
            future: VideoThumbGetter.thumbnailFromVideo(
              video: 'path_to_your_video.mp4', // Replace with your video path
              time: Duration(seconds: 1), // Time to capture the thumbnail
            ),
            builder: (context, snapshot) {
              if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                return CircularProgressIndicator();
              } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
                return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}');
              } else {
                return Image.file(snapshot.data); // Display the thumbnail
              }
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we use a `FutureBuilder` to asynchronously fetch the thumbnail from the specified video file. The thumbnail is displayed once it is successfully retrieved.

# Complete Example of video_thumb_getter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:video_thumb_getter/video_thumb_getter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Video Thumbnail Getter')),
        body: Center(
          child: FutureBuilder(
            // Initiating the process to get the thumbnail from the video
            future: VideoThumbGetter.thumbnailFromVideo(
              video: 'path_to_your_video.mp4', // Specify the path to your video file
              time: Duration(seconds: 1), // Specify the time to capture the thumbnail
            ),
            builder: (context, snapshot) {
              // Checking the connection state of the Future
              if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                // While waiting for the thumbnail, show a loading indicator
                return CircularProgressIndicator();
              } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
                // If there's an error, display the error message
                return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}');
              } else {
                // Once the thumbnail is retrieved, display it as an Image widget
                return Image.file(snapshot.data); // Display the thumbnail
              }
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, a FutureBuilder is used to fetch the thumbnail from the specified video file.
// 4. While the thumbnail is being fetched, a CircularProgressIndicator is displayed.
// 5. If an error occurs during the fetching process, the error message is displayed.
// 6. Once the thumbnail is successfully retrieved, it is displayed as an Image widget in the center of the screen.
