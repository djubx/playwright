# Hypersdkflutter: Setup and Usage Tutorial

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the **hypersdkflutter** package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter applications.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **hypersdkflutter** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  hypersdkflutter: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open the `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions added in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

3. If the package requires any specific SDK versions, make sure to update the `compileSdkVersion` and `targetSdkVersion` in `build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    compileSdkVersion 31  // or the latest version
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        targetSdkVersion 31  // or the latest version
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open the `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions if required:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

3. Ensure that your iOS deployment target is set to at least 12.0 in the `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '12.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initialize and use the **hypersdkflutter** package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:hypersdkflutter/hypersdkflutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Hypersdkflutter Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  late RealFlutter realFlutter;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the RealFlutter SDK
    realFlutter = RealFlutter();
    realFlutter.initialize();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Hypersdkflutter Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Example of using a feature from the SDK
            realFlutter.performAction();
          },
          child: Text('Perform Action'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize the **RealFlutter** class and call its `performAction` method when the button is pressed. 

This setup provides a basic understanding of how to integrate and use the **hypersdkflutter** package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Hypersdkflutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:hypersdkflutter/hypersdkflutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Hypersdkflutter Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  late RealFlutter realFlutter; // Declare an instance of RealFlutter

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the RealFlutter SDK
    realFlutter = RealFlutter();
    realFlutter.initialize(); // Call the initialize method to set up the SDK
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Hypersdkflutter Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Example of using a feature from the SDK
            realFlutter.performAction(); // Call a method from the RealFlutter class
          },
          child: Text('Perform Action'), // Button to trigger the action
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. HomeScreen is a stateful widget that initializes the RealFlutter SDK in initState.
// 4. When the button is pressed, it calls the performAction method from the RealFlutter instance.
// 5. This demonstrates how to integrate and use the hypersdkflutter package in a Flutter app.
