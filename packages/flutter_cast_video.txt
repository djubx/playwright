# Setting Up and Using the `flutter_cast_video` Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_cast_video` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_cast_video` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_cast_video: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following entries to allow network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that we have set up the package, let's implement a simple casting feature in our Flutter app.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_cast_video/flutter_cast_video.dart';
```

2. Initialize the casting functionality in your main widget:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Initialize the cast controller
  final CastController _castController = CastController();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Start discovering devices
    _castController.startDiscovery();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Stop discovery when the widget is disposed
    _castController.stopDiscovery();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Cast Video')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Start casting a video
            _castController.castVideo('https://example.com/video.mp4');
          },
          child: Text('Cast Video'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple UI with a button that, when pressed, will cast a video to the selected device.

## Step 4: Running the App

Run your Flutter application on a device or emulator. Ensure that your casting device (like Chromecast) is on the same network. When you press the "Cast Video" button, the app will start casting the specified video URL.

With these steps, you have successfully set up and used the `flutter_cast_video` package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Using `flutter_cast_video`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_cast_video/flutter_cast_video.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Create an instance of CastController to manage casting
  final CastController _castController = CastController();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Start discovering available casting devices
    _castController.startDiscovery();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Stop device discovery when the widget is disposed
    _castController.stopDiscovery();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Cast Video')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Cast a video when the button is pressed
            _castController.castVideo('https://example.com/video.mp4');
          },
          child: Text('Cast Video'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts by running the MyApp widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which initializes the CastController.
// 3. In the initState method, device discovery begins, allowing the app to find available casting devices.
// 4. The build method creates a simple UI with a button labeled "Cast Video."
// 5. When the button is pressed, the castVideo method is called with a video URL, initiating the casting process.
// 6. When the widget is disposed, device discovery is stopped to free up resources.
