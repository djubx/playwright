# Setting Up and Using the Luthor Flutter Package
=============================================

In this section, we'll walk through the process of setting up and using the Luthor Flutter package.

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

To add the Luthor package to your project, simply add the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  luthor: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

To use the Luthor package, you need to import it into your Dart file. Add the following line at the top of your file:

```dart
import 'package:luthor/luthor.dart';
```

### Step 3: Initialize the Package

To initialize the Luthor package, you need to create an instance of the `Luthor` class. You can do this by adding the following line to your code:

```dart
Luthor luthor = Luthor();
```

### Platform-Specific Details

The Luthor package supports both Android and iOS platforms. However, there are some platform-specific details you need to be aware of:

*   **Android:** To use the Luthor package on Android, you need to add the following line to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

    ```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

*   **iOS:** To use the Luthor package on iOS, you need to add the following line to your `Info.plist` file:

    ```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

```dart
// Import the Luthor package
import 'package:luthor/luthor.dart';

// Import the Flutter framework
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

// Create a new class that extends the StatefulWidget class
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  // Create a new instance of the RealFlutter class
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

// Create a new class that extends the State class
class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Create a new instance of the Luthor class
  Luthor luthor = Luthor();

  // Create a new method that initializes the Luthor package
  void _initLuthor() {
    // Initialize the Luthor package
    luthor.init();
  }

  // Create a new method that uses the Luthor package
  void _useLuthor() {
    // Use the Luthor package to perform some action
    luthor.performAction();
  }

  // Create a new widget that displays a button
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a new button that calls the _initLuthor method when pressed
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Luthor Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _initLuthor,
              child: Text('Initialize Luthor'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _useLuthor,
              child: Text('Use Luthor'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Create a new main function that runs the RealFlutter class
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Luthor Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}
```

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user presses the "Initialize Luthor" button, which calls the _initLuthor method.
// 2. The _initLuthor method initializes the Luthor package by calling the init method.
// 3. The user presses the "Use Luthor" button, which calls the _useLuthor method.
// 4. The _useLuthor method uses the Luthor package to perform some action by calling the performAction method.

// In summary, this code creates a new Flutter application that uses the Luthor package to perform some action.
// The application has two buttons: "Initialize Luthor" and "Use Luthor".
// When the user presses the "Initialize Luthor" button, the Luthor package is initialized.
// When the user presses the "Use Luthor" button, the Luthor package is used to perform some action.
