# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Package

## Installation
To get started with the `multiselect_dropdown_with_select_all` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  multiselect_dropdown_with_select_all: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/multiselect_dropdown_with_select_all).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Usage
To use the package, you can create a simple widget that utilizes the `MultiSelectDropdown` class provided by the package. Below is a basic example of how to implement it in your Flutter application.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:multiselect_dropdown_with_select_all/multiselect_dropdown_with_select_all.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  List<String> selectedItems = [];
  final List<String> items = ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3', 'Option 4'];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('MultiSelect Dropdown Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: MultiSelectDropdown(
          items: items,
          selectedItems: selectedItems,
          onChanged: (value) {
            setState(() {
              selectedItems = value;
            });
          },
          showSelectAll: true, // Enable the Select All option
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple app with a multi-select dropdown that allows users to select multiple options from a predefined list. The `onChanged` callback updates the state with the selected items.

# Complete Example: A Functional Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:multiselect_dropdown_with_select_all/multiselect_dropdown_with_select_all.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'MultiSelect Dropdown Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // List to hold selected items
  List<String> selectedItems = [];
  // List of options to display in the dropdown
  final List<String> items = ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3', 'Option 4'];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('MultiSelect Dropdown Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: MultiSelectDropdown(
          items: items, // Pass the list of items to the dropdown
          selectedItems: selectedItems, // Bind the selected items
          onChanged: (value) {
            // Update the state with the selected items
            setState(() {
              selectedItems = value;
            });
          },
          showSelectAll: true, // Enable the Select All option
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of selected items.
// 4. In the build method, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. The MultiSelectDropdown widget is instantiated with the list of items and a callback for when the selection changes.
// 6. When the user selects or deselects items, the onChanged callback updates the selectedItems list and rebuilds the UI to reflect the changes.
