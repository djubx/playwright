# Complete Example of Using pretty_qr_code_plus

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pretty_qr_code_plus/pretty_qr_code_plus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Pretty QR Code Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Pretty QR Code Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Displaying the QR code
              PrettyQr(
                data: "https://example.com", // The data to encode
                size: 200, // Size of the QR code
                errorCorrectLevel: QrErrorCorrectLevel.H, // Error correction level
                roundEdges: true, // Rounded edges for a modern look
                // Customizing colors
                elementColor: Colors.blue, // Color of the QR code elements
                backgroundColor: Colors.white, // Background color
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Spacing between elements
              Text(
                'Scan the QR code above!', // Instruction for the user
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Pretty QR Code Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a column with two children:
//    - A PrettyQr widget that generates a QR code with the specified data, size, error correction level, and colors.
//    - A Text widget that instructs the user to scan the QR code.
// 5. The PrettyQr widget is customizable, allowing for a visually appealing QR code that fits the app's design.
