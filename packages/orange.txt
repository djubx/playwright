# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the "orange" Package

## Installation
To add the "orange" package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  orange: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, make sure to enable the necessary permissions in your `Info.plist` file if your app requires network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Using the Package
To utilize the features of the "orange" package, you can import it into your Dart files:

```dart
import 'package:orange/orange.dart';
```

You can now start using the custom widgets and utilities provided by the package. For example, you can create a simple UI with a custom button and a state management solution.

# Complete Example of Using the "orange" Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:orange/orange.dart'; // Importing the orange package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the main app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Orange Package Example',
      home: HomeScreen(), // Setting the home screen
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  String _data = 'No data fetched'; // Initial state

  // Function to fetch data using the orange package
  void _fetchData() async {
    // Using the orange package's networking utility to fetch data
    final response = await OrangeNetwork.get('https://api.example.com/data');
    if (response.statusCode == 200) {
      setState(() {
        _data = response.body; // Updating state with fetched data
      });
    } else {
      setState(() {
        _data = 'Failed to fetch data'; // Handling error
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Orange Package Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(_data), // Displaying fetched data
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _fetchData, // Fetch data on button press
              child: Text('Fetch Data'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is a stateful widget that manages its own state.
// 4. Initially, the state variable _data is set to 'No data fetched'.
// 5. When the user presses the 'Fetch Data' button, the _fetchData function is called.
// 6. This function makes an HTTP GET request using the OrangeNetwork utility.
// 7. If the request is successful, the state is updated with the fetched data.
// 8. The UI reflects the new state, displaying the fetched data or an error message.
```
