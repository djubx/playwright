Here's a detailed technical blog on the `flutter_skeleton_ui` Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Flutter Skeleton UI Package

The `flutter_skeleton_ui` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to create skeleton loading screens in their applications. Skeleton screens are a popular design pattern that provides a placeholder for content while it is being loaded, enhancing the user experience by giving a visual indication that data is being fetched.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `flutter_skeleton_ui` package in scenarios where:
- You have asynchronous data fetching, such as from APIs or databases.
- You want to improve the perceived performance of your app by showing users that content is loading.
- You aim to create a smoother user experience by reducing the perceived wait time.

## Features

- **Customizable Skeletons**: You can easily customize the shape, size, and color of the skeletons to match your app's design.
- **Multiple Skeleton Types**: The package supports various skeleton types, including rectangular, circular, and more complex shapes.
- **Easy Integration**: The package is straightforward to integrate into existing Flutter applications with minimal setup.

Overall, the `flutter_skeleton_ui` package is an excellent choice for developers looking to enhance their Flutter applications with visually appealing loading indicators.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_skeleton_ui

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_skeleton_ui` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_skeleton_ui: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_skeleton_ui).

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a skeleton loader.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_skeleton_ui/flutter_skeleton_ui.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Skeleton UI Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: SkeletonLoader(
          children: [
            Container(
              height: 100,
              width: double.infinity,
              color: Colors.grey[300],
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Container(
              height: 100,
              width: double.infinity,
              color: Colors.grey[300],
            ),
          ],
          period: Duration(seconds: 1),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple skeleton loader that displays two rectangular placeholders while the actual content is loading.

# Complete Example of flutter_skeleton_ui

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_skeleton_ui/flutter_skeleton_ui.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Skeleton UI Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Skeleton UI Example')),
        body: FutureBuilder(
          // Simulating a network call
          future: fetchData(),
          builder: (context, snapshot) {
            // If the data is still loading, show the skeleton loader
            if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
              return SkeletonLoader(
                children: [
                  Container(
                    height: 100,
                    width: double.infinity,
                    color: Colors.grey[300],
                  ),
                  SizedBox(height: 20),
                  Container(
                    height: 100,
                    width: double.infinity,
                    color: Colors.grey[300],
                  ),
                ],
                period: Duration(seconds: 1),
              );
            } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
              // If there is an error, show an error message
              return Center(child: Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}'));
            } else {
              // Once data is loaded, display the actual content
              return ListView(
                children: [
                  ListTile(title: Text('Data Item 1')),
                  ListTile(title: Text('Data Item 2')),
                ],
              );
            }
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Simulated network call
  Future<String> fetchData() async {
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3)); // Simulate a network delay
    return 'Data Loaded';
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is built, which contains a FutureBuilder to handle asynchronous data fetching.
// 3. While the data is being fetched (simulated with a delay), the SkeletonLoader is displayed, showing two grey rectangles as placeholders.
// 4. Once the data is loaded, the FutureBuilder updates the UI to show the actual content (in this case, two ListTile widgets).
// 5. If an error occurs during data fetching, an error message is displayed instead of the skeleton loader or the actual content.
```
