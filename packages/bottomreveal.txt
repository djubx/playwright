# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using BottomReveal

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the BottomReveal package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  bottomreveal: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using BottomReveal in Your App

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the BottomReveal widget.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:bottomreveal/bottomreveal.dart';
```

2. Use the `BottomReveal` widget in your widget tree. Hereâ€™s a basic implementation:

```dart
BottomReveal(
  revealHeight: 300, // Height of the revealed area
  child: YourContentWidget(), // Replace with your content widget
);
```

3. Customize the animation and behavior as needed. You can adjust properties like `animationDuration` and `animationCurve` to fit your design.

With these steps, you can effectively integrate the BottomReveal package into your Flutter application, providing a modern and interactive user experience.

# Complete Example of BottomReveal

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bottomreveal/bottomreveal.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'BottomReveal Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('BottomReveal Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Show the BottomReveal when the button is pressed
            showModalBottomSheet(
              context: context,
              builder: (context) {
                return BottomReveal(
                  revealHeight: 300, // Height of the revealed area
                  child: Container(
                    color: Colors.white,
                    child: Column(
                      mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,
                      children: [
                        ListTile(
                          title: Text('Item 1'),
                          onTap: () {
                            // Handle item tap
                          },
                        ),
                        ListTile(
                          title: Text('Item 2'),
                          onTap: () {
                            // Handle item tap
                          },
                        ),
                        ListTile(
                          title: Text('Close'),
                          onTap: () {
                            // Close the BottomReveal
                            Navigator.pop(context);
                          },
                        ),
                      ],
                    ),
                  ),
                );
              },
            );
          },
          child: Text('Show BottomReveal'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets MyApp as the root widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a HomeScreen as the home widget.
// 3. HomeScreen contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. In the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is displayed.
// 5. When the button is pressed, a modal bottom sheet is shown using showModalBottomSheet.
// 6. Inside the bottom sheet, the BottomReveal widget is used to create a reveal effect.
// 7. The revealed area contains a list of items, including a close option.
// 8. Tapping on 'Close' will dismiss the BottomReveal and return to the main screen.
```
