# Convert Native Image Stream Flutter Package

The `convert_native_img_stream` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to facilitate the conversion of native image streams into Flutter-compatible formats. This package is particularly useful for developers who need to handle image data from native sources, such as camera feeds or image processing libraries, and want to display or manipulate these images within their Flutter applications.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the `convert_native_img_stream` package in scenarios such as:

- **Real-time Image Processing**: When building applications that require real-time image processing, such as augmented reality (AR) apps or live camera filters.
- **Custom Image Handling**: If you are working with native image sources and need to convert them into a format that Flutter can easily work with.
- **Performance Optimization**: When you need to optimize image handling for better performance in your Flutter applications.

## Features

- **Native Image Stream Conversion**: Easily convert native image streams to Flutter-compatible formats.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Efficient Memory Management**: Designed to handle image data efficiently, minimizing memory usage and improving performance.

By leveraging this package, developers can enhance their Flutter applications with advanced image handling capabilities, making it an essential tool for any Flutter developer working with images.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Convert Native Image Stream Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `convert_native_img_stream` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  convert_native_img_stream: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file. Add the following lines within the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file. Include the following keys:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the camera for image processing.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the photo library for image selection.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to use the `convert_native_img_stream` package to convert a native image stream.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:convert_native_img_stream/convert_native_img_stream.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to hold the converted image
  Image? _image;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Start the image stream conversion
    _startImageStream();
  }

  void _startImageStream() async {
    // Start the native image stream
    final stream = await ConvertNativeImgStream.startImageStream();
    stream.listen((image) {
      // Update the state with the new image
      setState(() {
        _image = image;
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Convert Native Image Stream')),
      body: Center(
        child: _image != null
            ? _image // Display the converted image
            : CircularProgressIndicator(), // Show loading indicator
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that starts an image stream and displays the converted image. The `ConvertNativeImgStream.startImageStream()` method initiates the image stream, and we listen for new images to update the UI.

# Complete Example of Using Convert Native Image Stream

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:convert_native_img_stream/convert_native_img_stream.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to hold the converted image
  Image? _image;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Start the image stream conversion
    _startImageStream();
  }

  void _startImageStream() async {
    // Start the native image stream
    final stream = await ConvertNativeImgStream.startImageStream();
    stream.listen((image) {
      // Update the state with the new image
      setState(() {
        _image = image;
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Convert Native Image Stream')),
      body: Center(
        child: _image != null
            ? _image // Display the converted image
            : CircularProgressIndicator(), // Show loading indicator
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the initState method, we call _startImageStream to begin listening for image streams.
// 3. The _startImageStream method calls ConvertNativeImgStream.startImageStream() to initiate the image stream.
// 4. We listen for new images from the stream and update the _image variable.
// 5. In the build method, we check if _image is not null. If it has a value, we display the image; otherwise, we show a loading indicator.
// 6. The UI updates automatically whenever a new image is received from the stream.
