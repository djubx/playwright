# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_map_location_picker

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_map_location_picker` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the `flutter_map_location_picker` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_map_location_picker: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_map_location_picker).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request location permissions:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show nearby places.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show nearby places.</string>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage
Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the location picker.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_map_location_picker/flutter_map_location_picker.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Location Picker Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Open the location picker
              final selectedLocation = await showLocationPicker(
                context,
                'YOUR_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN', // Replace with your Mapbox access token
                initialCenter: LatLng(45.521563, -122.677433), // Initial center of the map
                myLocationButtonEnabled: true, // Show the button to get the user's current location
              );

              // Check if a location was selected
              if (selectedLocation != null) {
                // Display the selected location
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Selected Location: $selectedLocation')),
                );
              }
            },
            child: Text('Pick a Location'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example: A Functional Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_map_location_picker/flutter_map_location_picker.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Location Picker Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Open the location picker
              final selectedLocation = await showLocationPicker(
                context,
                'YOUR_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN', // Replace with your Mapbox access token
                initialCenter: LatLng(45.521563, -122.677433), // Initial center of the map
                myLocationButtonEnabled: true, // Show the button to get the user's current location
              );

              // Check if a location was selected
              if (selectedLocation != null) {
                // Display the selected location
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Selected Location: $selectedLocation')),
                );
              }
            },
            child: Text('Pick a Location'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which builds a MaterialApp.
// 2. The home of the app is a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, there is an ElevatedButton labeled 'Pick a Location'.
// 4. When the button is pressed, it triggers the onPressed callback.
// 5. The showLocationPicker function is called, which opens the map interface for location selection.
// 6. The user can select a location on the map, and the selected location is returned.
// 7. If a location is selected, a SnackBar displays the selected location's details.
// 8. The app provides a simple and interactive way for users to pick a location.
