# Overview of the telephony_fix Flutter Package

The `telephony_fix` package is a Flutter plugin that provides a way to interact with telephony features on mobile devices. This package is particularly useful for applications that require SMS functionalities, such as sending and receiving messages, checking the status of the SIM card, and managing phone calls. 

## When to Use This Package
You might consider using `telephony_fix` in scenarios such as:
- Building a messaging app that needs to send SMS.
- Creating an application that requires phone call functionalities.
- Developing a service that needs to check the SIM card status or manage telephony features.

## Key Features
- **Send SMS**: Easily send SMS messages programmatically.
- **Receive SMS**: Listen for incoming SMS messages.
- **Check SIM Status**: Access information about the SIM card, such as its state and number.
- **Call Management**: Initiate phone calls directly from the app.

The `telephony_fix` package is a powerful tool for developers looking to integrate telephony features into their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using telephony_fix

## Installation
To add the `telephony_fix` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  telephony_fix: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/telephony_fix).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. **Permissions**: Add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SEND_SMS"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_SMS"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_SMS"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CALL_PHONE"/>
```

2. **Requesting Permissions**: You will need to request runtime permissions for SMS and call functionalities. Use the `permission_handler` package to manage permissions effectively.

### iOS
1. **Permissions**: Add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file located in `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSContactsUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your contacts to send SMS.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library.</string>
```

2. **Limitations**: Note that iOS has strict limitations on sending SMS programmatically without user interaction.

## Using the Package
After setting up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to send an SMS.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:telephony_fix/telephony_fix.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  final Telephony telephony = Telephony.instance;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Request permissions for SMS
    telephony.requestSmsPermissions;
  }

  void sendSms() async {
    // Sending an SMS to a specified number
    await telephony.sendSms(
      to: '1234567890',
      message: 'Hello from RealFlutter!',
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Telephony Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: sendSms,
          child: Text('Send SMS'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that sends an SMS when a button is pressed. The `sendSms` function utilizes the `sendSms` method from the `telephony_fix` package to send a message to a specified number.

# Complete Example of Using telephony_fix

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:telephony_fix/telephony_fix.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  final Telephony telephony = Telephony.instance;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Request SMS permissions when the app starts
    telephony.requestSmsPermissions;
  }

  void sendSms() async {
    // Sending an SMS to a specified number
    await telephony.sendSms(
      to: '1234567890', // Replace with the recipient's phone number
      message: 'Hello from RealFlutter!', // The message to send
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Telephony Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: sendSms, // Call sendSms when the button is pressed
          child: Text('Send SMS'), // Button text
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and requests SMS permissions in the initState method.
// 2. The user sees a button labeled "Send SMS" on the screen.
// 3. When the button is pressed, the sendSms function is called.
// 4. The sendSms function uses the telephony instance to send an SMS to the specified number.
// 5. The message "Hello from RealFlutter!" is sent to the recipient's phone number.
// 6. The user can check their SMS app to see the sent message.
