# Exploring the tonutils Flutter Package

The `tonutils` package is a powerful utility library designed for developers working with the TON blockchain. It provides a set of tools and functions that simplify interactions with the TON network, making it easier to build decentralized applications (dApps) on Flutter. 

## When to Use `tonutils`
You should consider using `tonutils` when:
- You are developing a Flutter application that requires interaction with the TON blockchain.
- You need to perform operations such as sending transactions, querying balances, or managing smart contracts.
- You want to leverage the features of the TON blockchain without dealing with the complexities of low-level API calls.

## Key Features
- **Transaction Management**: Easily create and send transactions to the TON blockchain.
- **Smart Contract Interaction**: Simplifies the process of interacting with smart contracts deployed on the TON network.
- **Balance Queries**: Quickly check the balance of TON wallets.
- **Event Listening**: Listen for events emitted by smart contracts or the blockchain.

With these features, `tonutils` provides a robust foundation for building TON-based applications in Flutter.

# Setting Up and Using the tonutils Package

## Installation
To get started with the `tonutils` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  tonutils: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/tonutils).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` if your app requires internet access:
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following to allow network requests:
   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

## Basic Usage
Once you have installed the package and configured your project, you can start using `tonutils` in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initialize the package and perform a balance query.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tonutils/tonutils.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('TON Utils Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initialize the TON client
              final tonClient = TonClient();
              // Query the balance of a specific wallet address
              final balance = await tonClient.getBalance('your_wallet_address');
              // Display the balance
              print('Wallet Balance: $balance');
            },
            child: Text('Check Balance'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that initializes the `tonutils` client and queries the balance of a specified wallet address when a button is pressed.

# Complete Example of Using tonutils in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tonutils/tonutils.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('TON Utils Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initialize the TON client
              final tonClient = TonClient();
              
              // Query the balance of a specific wallet address
              final balance = await tonClient.getBalance('your_wallet_address');
              
              // Display the balance
              print('Wallet Balance: $balance');
            },
            child: Text('Check Balance'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which builds a MaterialApp.
// 2. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. The Center widget contains an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the onPressed callback is triggered.
// 5. Inside the callback, a TonClient instance is created to interact with the TON blockchain.
// 6. The getBalance method is called with a specified wallet address to fetch the balance.
// 7. Finally, the balance is printed to the console for the user to see.

### Summary
In this blog post, we explored the `tonutils` Flutter package, which provides essential tools for interacting with the TON blockchain. We covered the installation process, platform-specific configurations, and provided a complete example demonstrating how to check a wallet's balance. This package is particularly useful for developers looking to build dApps on the TON network, offering a straightforward API for common blockchain operations.
