// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user opens the app and is presented with a home page containing three buttons.
// 2. Each button represents a different type of page transition (fade, scale, and slide).
// 3. When the user clicks a button, the app navigates to a new page using the selected transition type.
// 4. The new page displays a simple text message.
// 5. The user can navigate back to the home page by clicking the back button.
