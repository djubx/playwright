void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the main application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Persian Utils Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Persian Utils Demo'), // App bar title
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Display formatted Persian text
              Text(
                PersianUtils.formatText('سلام دنیا!'), // Format Persian text
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Display current Persian date
              Text(
                'تاریخ امروز: ${PersianUtils.formatDate(DateTime.now())}', // Format current date
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Display formatted Persian number
              Text(
                'عدد: ${PersianUtils.formatNumber(1234567)}', // Format number
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the main UI of the app.
// 3. The MaterialApp widget sets up the app's title and home screen.
// 4. The Scaffold widget provides a structure for the app, including an AppBar and a body.
// 5. The body contains a Center widget that centers its child widgets.
// 6. A Column widget is used to arrange the text widgets vertically.
// 7. The first Text widget displays a formatted Persian greeting using PersianUtils.formatText.
// 8. The second Text widget shows the current date formatted in Persian using PersianUtils.formatDate.
// 9. The third Text widget displays a formatted Persian number using PersianUtils.formatNumber.
