Here’s a detailed technical blog on the "measure_size_builder" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Measure Size Builder Flutter Package

The **measure_size_builder** package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that allows you to measure the size of widgets during the build phase. This can be particularly useful when you need to adjust layouts dynamically based on the size of child widgets. 

## When to Use This Package

You might want to use the **measure_size_builder** package in scenarios such as:
- **Dynamic Layouts**: When you need to create responsive designs that adapt based on the size of their children.
- **Custom Animations**: If you want to animate widgets based on their size changes.
- **Complex UI Components**: When building components that require precise control over their dimensions.

## Features

- **Size Measurement**: Easily measure the width and height of any widget.
- **Rebuild on Size Change**: Automatically rebuilds the widget tree when the size of a child widget changes.
- **Flexible Usage**: Can be used with any widget, making it versatile for various UI designs.

Overall, the **measure_size_builder** package enhances the flexibility and responsiveness of Flutter applications, allowing developers to create more dynamic and user-friendly interfaces.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Measure Size Builder

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **measure_size_builder** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  measure_size_builder: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the platform version in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using Measure Size Builder

To use the **measure_size_builder** package, you can wrap any widget with the `MeasureSize` widget. Here’s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:measure_size_builder/measure_size_builder.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Measure Size Builder Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: MeasureSize(
            onChange: (size) {
              print('Widget size: ${size.width} x ${size.height}');
            },
            child: Container(
              color: Colors.blue,
              width: 200,
              height: 100,
              child: Center(child: Text('Hello, Flutter!')),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, the `MeasureSize` widget measures the size of the `Container` and prints it to the console whenever it changes.

# Complete Example of Measure Size Builder

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:measure_size_builder/measure_size_builder.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Measure Size Builder Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Using MeasureSize to measure the size of the child widget
          child: MeasureSize(
            onChange: (size) {
              // This callback is triggered whenever the size of the child changes
              print('Widget size: ${size.width} x ${size.height}');
            },
            child: Container(
              // The child widget whose size we want to measure
              color: Colors.blue,
              width: 200, // Fixed width
              height: 100, // Fixed height
              child: Center(
                // Centering the text inside the container
                child: Text(
                  'Hello, Flutter!',
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  // Entry point of the application
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the Flutter application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the main UI.
// 3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// 4. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. The MeasureSize widget wraps a Container, allowing us to measure its size.
// 6. The onChange callback of MeasureSize prints the size of the Container to the console.
// 7. The Container has a fixed width and height, and it contains centered text.
// 8. When the size of the Container changes, the new dimensions are printed to the console.
```
