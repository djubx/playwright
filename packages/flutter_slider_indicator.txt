## Basic Usage
To use the `flutter_slider_indicator`, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:
   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter_slider_indicator/flutter_slider_indicator.dart';

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the slider indicator in your Flutter app:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_slider_indicator/flutter_slider_indicator.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Slider Indicator Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: SliderIndicator(
            itemCount: 5, // Total number of items
            currentIndex: 0, // Current index
            indicatorColor: Colors.blue, // Color of the indicators
            activeIndicatorColor: Colors.red, // Color of the active indicator
            indicatorSize: 10.0, // Size of the indicators
            spacing: 8.0, // Spacing between indicators
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application with a slider indicator that shows the current position among five items.

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  int _currentIndex = 0; // Variable to track the current index

  // List of items to display (could be images, text, etc.)
  final List<String> _items = [
    'Item 1',
    'Item 2',
    'Item 3',
    'Item 4',
    'Item 5',
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Slider Indicator Example')),
        body: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,

              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Add some space
            // SliderIndicator widget to show the current position
            SliderIndicator(
              itemCount: _items.length, // Total number of items
              currentIndex: _currentIndex, // Current index
              indicatorColor: Colors.blue, // Color of the indicators
              activeIndicatorColor: Colors.red, // Color of the active indicator
              indicatorSize: 10.0, // Size of the indicators
              spacing: 8.0, // Spacing between indicators
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Add some space
            // Row of buttons to navigate through items
            Row(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              children: [
                // Previous button
                IconButton(
                  icon: Icon(Icons.arrow_back),
                  onPressed: () {
                    // Decrement the index and update the state
                    setState(() {
                      if (_currentIndex > 0) {
                        _currentIndex--;
                      }
                    });
                  },
                ),
                // Next button
                IconButton(
                  icon: Icon(Icons.arrow_forward),
                  onPressed: () {
                    // Increment the index and update the state
                    setState(() {
                      if (_currentIndex < _items.length - 1) {
                        _currentIndex++;
                      }
                    });
                  },
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation
// The application starts with a StatefulWidget called RealFlutter.
// It maintains the current index of the displayed item in the _currentIndex variable.
// The _items list contains the items to be displayed.
// In the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// The current item is displayed in a Text widget based on the _currentIndex.
// A SliderIndicator widget is used to show the current position among the items.
// Two IconButton widgets allow the user to navigate through the items.
// When the user presses the previous button, the _currentIndex is decremented, and the state is updated.
// When the user presses the next button, the _currentIndex is incremented, and the state is updated.
// The SliderIndicator updates automatically to reflect the current index.
