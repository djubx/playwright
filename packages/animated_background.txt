# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Animated Background Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `animated_background` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  animated_background: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file, especially if you plan to use features that require user permissions. However, for basic usage of `animated_background`, no special permissions are required.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement an animated background.

# Complete Example of Using Animated Background

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_background/animated_background.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animated Background Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        body: AnimatedBackground(
          behaviour: RandomParticleBehaviour(),
          vsync: this,
          child: Center(
            child: Text(
              'Welcome to RealFlutter!',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.white),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The RealFlutter class is the main entry point of the application.
// It sets up a MaterialApp with a Scaffold as the main structure.
// Inside the Scaffold, we use AnimatedBackground to create a dynamic background.
// The behaviour is set to RandomParticleBehaviour, which creates random particles in the background.
// The child of AnimatedBackground is a Center widget that contains a Text widget displaying a welcome message.
// The text is styled to be large and white, making it stand out against the animated background.
```

// The application starts by running the main function, which initializes the RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp, which is the main structure of the app.
// Inside the MaterialApp, we have a Scaffold that provides a basic layout structure.
// The AnimatedBackground widget is used to create the animated effect, with a behaviour of RandomParticleBehaviour.
// This behaviour generates random particles that move around the screen, creating a lively background.
// The Center widget is used to center the text "Welcome to RealFlutter!" on the screen.
// The text is styled to be large and white, ensuring it is visible against the animated background.
// Overall, this example demonstrates how to integrate the animated_background package into a Flutter application, providing a visually appealing user interface.
