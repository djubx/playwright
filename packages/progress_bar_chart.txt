# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Progress Bar Chart Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `progress_bar_chart` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  progress_bar_chart: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a progress bar chart.

# Complete Example of Using Progress Bar Chart

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:progress_bar_chart/progress_bar_chart.dart'; // Import the package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the main app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Progress Bar Chart Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Progress Bar Chart Example'), // App title
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ProgressBarChart(
            // Create a ProgressBarChart widget
            data: [
              // Define the data for the progress bars
              ProgressBarData(label: 'Task 1', value: 0.7), // 70% completion
              ProgressBarData(label: 'Task 2', value: 0.5), // 50% completion
              ProgressBarData(label: 'Task 3', value: 0.9), // 90% completion
            ],
            barColor: Colors.blue, // Set the color of the bars
            backgroundColor: Colors.grey[300], // Set the background color
            animationDuration: Duration(seconds: 1), // Set animation duration
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Progress Bar Chart Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a ProgressBarChart widget.
// 5. The ProgressBarChart widget takes a list of ProgressBarData objects, each representing a task with a label and a completion value.
// 6. The bars are styled with a blue color for the progress and a light grey for the background.
// 7. The animation duration for the progress bars is set to 1 second, providing a smooth transition when the app starts.
```
