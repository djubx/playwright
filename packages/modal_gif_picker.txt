```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  modal_gif_picker: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/modal_gif_picker).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following keys to request permission for accessing the photo library:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to select GIFs.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `modal_gif_picker`, you can create a simple widget that opens the GIF picker when a button is pressed. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:modal_gif_picker/modal_gif_picker.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('GIF Picker Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Open the GIF picker modal
              final gif = await showModalGifPicker(context);
              if (gif != null) {
                // Handle the selected GIF
                print('Selected GIF: ${gif.url}');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Pick a GIF'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, the GIF picker modal opens, allowing the user to select a GIF. The selected GIF's URL is printed to the console.

With these steps, you can easily integrate the `modal_gif_picker` into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of modal_gif_picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:modal_gif_picker/modal_gif_picker.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('GIF Picker Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Open the GIF picker modal
              final gif = await showModalGifPicker(context);
              if (gif != null) {
                // Handle the selected GIF
                print('Selected GIF: ${gif.url}');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Pick a GIF'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The main function is the entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'GIF Picker Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 5. An ElevatedButton is created, which, when pressed, triggers the GIF picker modal.
// 6. The showModalGifPicker function is called, which opens the GIF picker.
// 7. If a GIF is selected, its URL is printed to the console.
// 8. This simple flow allows users to pick GIFs easily and see the result in the console.
