// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user enters their username, password, domain, and URL in the text fields.
// 2. When the user clicks the "Authenticate" button, the `_authenticate` function is called.
// 3. The `_authenticate` function creates an NTLM client instance with the entered credentials.
// 4. The NTLM client authenticates with the NTLM server using the entered URL and method (in this case, a GET request).
// 5. The response from the NTLM server is stored in the `_response` variable.
// 6. The `_response` variable is displayed on the screen.
