# Overview of the ntlm Flutter Package

The `ntlm` package is a Flutter library designed to facilitate NTLM (NT LAN Manager) authentication, which is commonly used in enterprise environments for secure communication between clients and servers. This package is particularly useful when working with APIs that require NTLM authentication, allowing developers to easily integrate secure network requests into their Flutter applications.

## When to Use the ntlm Package
- **Enterprise Applications**: If you are developing applications that need to connect to corporate APIs secured with NTLM.
- **Intranet Applications**: For apps that operate within a corporate network and require secure authentication.
- **Legacy Systems**: When interfacing with older systems that still rely on NTLM for authentication.

## Key Features
- **Simple Integration**: Easy to add to your Flutter project with minimal setup.
- **Support for Multiple Platforms**: Works on both Android and iOS, ensuring cross-platform compatibility.
- **Customizable**: Allows for customization of authentication parameters to fit specific needs.

# Setting Up and Using the ntlm Package

## Installation
To get started with the `ntlm` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  ntlm: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable App Transport Security (ATS) if you are connecting to non-secure endpoints. Add the following to your `Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Using the ntlm Package
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the `ntlm` package to make an authenticated HTTP request:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ntlm/ntlm.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('NTLM Authentication Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Create an instance of NTLM
              final ntlm = Ntlm(
                username: 'your_username',
                password: 'your_password',
                domain: 'your_domain',
              );

              // Make a request to the secured API
              final response = await ntlm.get('https://your-secure-api.com/data');

              // Check the response
              if (response.statusCode == 200) {
                print('Data: ${response.body}');
              } else {
                print('Error: ${response.statusCode}');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Make NTLM Request'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Using the ntlm Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ntlm/ntlm.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('NTLM Authentication Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Create an instance of NTLM with user credentials
              final ntlm = Ntlm(
                username: 'your_username', // Replace with your username
                password: 'your_password', // Replace with your password
                domain: 'your_domain', // Replace with your domain
              );

              // Make a GET request to the secured API
              final response = await ntlm.get('https://your-secure-api.com/data');

              // Check the response status code
              if (response.statusCode == 200) {
                // If the request is successful, print the data
                print('Data: ${response.body}');
              } else {
                // If the request fails, print the error status code
                print('Error: ${response.statusCode}');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Make NTLM Request'), // Button to trigger the request
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which builds a MaterialApp.
// 2. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. The Center widget contains an ElevatedButton that, when pressed, triggers an asynchronous function.
// 4. This function creates an instance of the Ntlm class with the user's credentials.
// 5. It then makes a GET request to a specified secure API endpoint.
// 6. The response is checked; if successful (status code 200), the data is printed to the console.
// 7. If the request fails, the error status code is printed instead.
