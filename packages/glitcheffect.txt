# Setting Up and Using the GlitchEffect Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up the `glitcheffect` package in a Flutter project and demonstrate how to use it effectively.

## Setup Process

1. **Add Dependency**: First, add the `glitcheffect` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     glitcheffect: ^1.0.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run `flutter pub get` to install the new package.

3. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the package to start using it.

   ```dart
   import 'package:glitcheffect/glitcheffect.dart';
   ```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

- Ensure your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to support all features of the package.

  ```gradle
  defaultConfig {
      minSdkVersion 21
  }
  ```

### iOS

- No specific configurations are required for iOS, but ensure your deployment target is set to iOS 10.0 or higher in your `ios/Podfile`.

  ```ruby
  platform :ios, '10.0'
  ```

## Using the GlitchEffect

To use the `glitcheffect` package, wrap any widget with the `GlitchEffect` widget. Customize the effect using the available parameters such as `duration`, `frequency`, and `intensity`.

```dart
GlitchEffect(
  child: Text('Glitching Text'),
  duration: Duration(seconds: 1),
  frequency: 0.5,
  intensity: 0.3,
)
```

# Complete Example: GlitchEffect in Action

Below is a complete Flutter application demonstrating the use of the `glitcheffect` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:glitcheffect/glitcheffect.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Glitch Effect Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: GlitchEffectDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class GlitchEffectDemo extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Glitch Effect Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        // Applying the GlitchEffect to a Text widget
        child: GlitchEffect(
          child: Text(
            'Glitching Text',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
          ),
          duration: Duration(seconds: 1), // Duration of each glitch cycle
          frequency: 0.5, // Frequency of the glitch effect
          intensity: 0.3, // Intensity of the glitch effect
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The application starts by running the `MyApp` class.
// `MyApp` is a stateless widget that sets up the MaterialApp.
// The home of the app is set to `GlitchEffectDemo`, which is another stateless widget.
// `GlitchEffectDemo` builds a simple UI with an AppBar and a centered text.
// The `GlitchEffect` widget is applied to the text, creating a glitch effect.
// The effect is customized with duration, frequency, and intensity parameters.
