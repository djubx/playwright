# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `flutter_svg_image`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_svg_image` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_svg_image: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_svg_image/flutter_svg_image.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package

You can now use the `SvgImage` widget to display SVG images. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
SvgImage.asset(
  'assets/images/example.svg',
  width: 100,
  height: 100,
)
```

This will render the SVG image located in your assets folder.

## Conclusion

You are now ready to use the `flutter_svg_image` package in your Flutter applications. With its easy setup and powerful features, you can enhance your app's UI with beautiful SVG graphics.

# Complete Example of Using `flutter_svg_image`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart'; // Importing Flutter material package
import 'package:flutter_svg_image/flutter_svg_image.dart'; // Importing the flutter_svg_image package

// Main entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the RealFlutter app
}

// Main application class
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter SVG Image Example', // Title of the app
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('SVG Image Demo'), // App bar title
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: SvgImage.asset(
            'assets/images/example.svg', // Path to the SVG image
            width: 200, // Width of the SVG image
            height: 200, // Height of the SVG image
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application, which calls runApp() to start the app.
// 2. The RealFlutter class extends StatelessWidget, which means it is immutable and can be rebuilt.
// 3. The build method returns a MaterialApp widget, which is the root of the application.
// 4. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold widget is used to provide a structure for the app, including an AppBar and a body.
// 5. The AppBar contains a title, and the body is centered with a SvgImage widget that displays the SVG image.
// 6. The SVG image is loaded from the assets folder, and its size is set to 200x200 pixels.
```
