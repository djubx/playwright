# Tutorial: Setting Up flutter_speed_dial

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To use the `flutter_speed_dial` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_speed_dial: ^5.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Basic Setup

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 3: Using flutter_speed_dial

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a speed dial in your app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_speed_dial/flutter_speed_dial.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Speed Dial Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Press the button below!'),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: SpeedDial(
        animatedIcon: AnimatedIcons.menu_close,
        backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
        children: [
          SpeedDialChild(
            child: Icon(Icons.add),
            label: 'Add',
            onTap: () => print('Add tapped'),
          ),
          SpeedDialChild(
            child: Icon(Icons.edit),
            label: 'Edit',
            onTap: () => print('Edit tapped'),
          ),
          SpeedDialChild(
            child: Icon(Icons.delete),
            label: 'Delete',
            onTap: () => print('Delete tapped'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **SpeedDial Widget**: This is the main widget that creates the speed dial.
- **animatedIcon**: This property allows you to set an animated icon for the dial.
- **children**: This is a list of `SpeedDialChild` widgets that represent the actions available in the dial.

Now you can run your application, and you should see a floating action button that expands into multiple actions when pressed.

# Complete Example of flutter_speed_dial

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_speed_dial/flutter_speed_dial.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Speed Dial Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Speed Dial Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Press the button below!'),
        ),
        floatingActionButton: SpeedDial(
          animatedIcon: AnimatedIcons.menu_close, // Icon that animates when opened/closed
          backgroundColor: Colors.blue, // Background color of the speed dial
          children: [
            SpeedDialChild(
              child: Icon(Icons.add), // Icon for the 'Add' action
              label: 'Add', // Label for the 'Add' action
              onTap: () => print('Add tapped'), // Action when 'Add' is tapped
            ),
            SpeedDialChild(
              child: Icon(Icons.edit), // Icon for the 'Edit' action
              label: 'Edit', // Label for the 'Edit' action
              onTap: () => print('Edit tapped'), // Action when 'Edit' is tapped
            ),
            SpeedDialChild(
              child: Icon(Icons.delete), // Icon for the 'Delete' action
              label: 'Delete', // Label for the 'Delete' action
              onTap: () => print('Delete tapped'), // Action when 'Delete' is tapped
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget, which is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class builds the main structure of the app, including the AppBar and body.
// 3. The SpeedDial widget is added as a floating action button, which contains multiple actions.
// 4. Each SpeedDialChild represents an action that can be performed when tapped.
// 5. When a user taps on the SpeedDial, it expands to show the available actions.
// 6. Tapping on any action prints a message to the console, demonstrating the action's functionality.

In summary, the `flutter_speed_dial` package provides a user-friendly way to implement multiple actions in a compact and visually appealing manner. The example above demonstrates how to set up and use the package effectively, allowing for a clean and efficient user interface.
