# Ant Media Flutter Package: A Comprehensive Overview

The **ant_media_flutter** package is a powerful tool for integrating real-time video streaming capabilities into Flutter applications. It leverages the Ant Media Server, allowing developers to build applications that can stream live video, record streams, and manage real-time communication effectively. This package is particularly useful for applications that require video conferencing, live broadcasting, or any scenario where real-time video interaction is essential.

## When to Use This Package
- **Live Streaming Applications**: If you are developing an app that requires live video broadcasting, such as a social media platform or a live event streaming service.
- **Video Conferencing**: For applications that need real-time video communication, like telehealth services or virtual meetings.
- **Interactive Gaming**: When building games that require real-time video interaction between players.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Video Streaming**: Stream video with low latency.
- **Recording Capabilities**: Record live streams for later playback.
- **Adaptive Bitrate Streaming**: Automatically adjusts the video quality based on the user's network conditions.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API for quick setup and implementation.

Overall, the **ant_media_flutter** package is an excellent choice for developers looking to incorporate robust video streaming features into their Flutter applications.

# Setting Up and Using the Ant Media Flutter Package

## Installation
To get started with the **ant_media_flutter** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  ant_media_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/ant_media_flutter).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. **Permissions**: Add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
```

2. **Minimum SDK Version**: Ensure your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21.

### iOS
1. **Permissions**: Add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera for video streaming.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio streaming.</string>
```

2. **Deployment Target**: Ensure your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0.

## Basic Usage
Once you have installed the package and configured your project, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to set up a basic video streaming application.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ant_media_flutter/ant_media_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Ant Media Flutter Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late AntMediaClient _antMediaClient;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the AntMediaClient with your server URL
    _antMediaClient = AntMediaClient(
      serverUrl: 'YOUR_SERVER_URL',
      streamId: 'YOUR_STREAM_ID',
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the client when the widget is removed
    _antMediaClient.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Ant Media Streaming'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Start streaming when the button is pressed
            _antMediaClient.startStreaming();
          },
          child: Text('Start Streaming'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Ant Media Flutter Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ant_media_flutter/ant_media_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Ant Media Flutter Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late AntMediaClient _antMediaClient; // Declare the AntMediaClient

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the AntMediaClient with your server URL and stream ID
    _antMediaClient = AntMediaClient(
      serverUrl: 'YOUR_SERVER_URL', // Replace with your Ant Media Server URL
      streamId: 'YOUR_STREAM_ID', // Replace with your stream ID
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the client when the widget is removed
    _antMediaClient.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Ant Media Streaming'), // App title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Start streaming when the button is pressed
            _antMediaClient.startStreaming(); // Start the video stream
          },
          child: Text('Start Streaming'), // Button text
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that manages the state of the video streaming.
// 4. In the initState method, an instance of AntMediaClient is created with the server URL and stream ID.
// 5. The dispose method ensures that the AntMediaClient is properly disposed of when the widget is removed from the widget tree.
// 6. The build method creates a simple UI with an AppBar and a button to start streaming.
// 7. When the button is pressed, the startStreaming method of AntMediaClient is called to initiate the video stream.
