# Setting Up and Using xayn_swipe_it

## Installation
To add the `xayn_swipe_it` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  xayn_swipe_it: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/xayn_swipe_it).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `xayn_swipe_it` package, you need to create a widget that utilizes the `SwipeIt` class. Below is a simple example of how to implement swipeable cards.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:xayn_swipe_it/xayn_swipe_it.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Swipe It Example')),
        body: SwipeIt(
          items: [
            CardItem(title: 'Card 1', description: 'Description 1'),
            CardItem(title: 'Card 2', description: 'Description 2'),
            CardItem(title: 'Card 3', description: 'Description 3'),
          ],
          onSwipe: (direction, item) {
            // Handle swipe event
            print('Swiped $direction on ${item.title}');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple app with swipeable cards. The `onSwipe` callback allows us to handle the swipe events.

With this setup, you can start building engaging swipeable interfaces in your Flutter applications!

# Complete Example of xayn_swipe_it

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:xayn_swipe_it/xayn_swipe_it.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Swipe It Example')),
        body: SwipeIt(
          items: [
            // Creating swipeable card items
            CardItem(title: 'Card 1', description: 'Description 1'),
            CardItem(title: 'Card 2', description: 'Description 2'),
            CardItem(title: 'Card 3', description: 'Description 3'),
          ],
          onSwipe: (direction, item) {
            // This callback is triggered when a card is swiped
            print('Swiped $direction on ${item.title}');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a SwipeIt widget.
// 3. The SwipeIt widget takes a list of CardItem objects, each representing a swipeable card.
// 4. The onSwipe callback is defined to handle swipe events, printing the direction and title of the swiped card.
// 5. Users can swipe left or right on the cards, triggering the onSwipe callback and providing a dynamic user experience.
