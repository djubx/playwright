### Tutorial

#### Installation

To get started with the `enough_giphy` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  enough_giphy: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/enough_giphy).

#### Platform-Specific Configuration

**For Android:**
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21.

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

**For iOS:**
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following permissions to allow internet access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

#### Using the Package

To use the `enough_giphy` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:enough_giphy/enough_giphy.dart';
```

You can then create a simple widget to search and display GIFs. Here’s a basic example:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Giphy Search'),
      ),
      body: GiphySearch(
        apiKey: 'YOUR_GIPHY_API_KEY', // Replace with your Giphy API key
        onSelected: (gif) {
          // Handle the selected GIF
          print(gif.url);
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, replace `'YOUR_GIPHY_API_KEY'` with your actual Giphy API key, which you can obtain by signing up on the Giphy Developer Portal.

### Complete Example

Here’s a complete Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the `enough_giphy` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:enough_giphy/enough_giphy.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Giphy Search',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: GiphySearchScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class GiphySearchScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Giphy Search'),
      ),
      body: GiphySearch(
        apiKey: 'YOUR_GIPHY_API_KEY', // Replace with your Giphy API key
        onSelected: (gif) {
          // Handle the selected GIF
          // Here we can show the selected GIF in a dialog or navigate to another screen
          showDialog(
            context: context,
            builder: (context) {
              return AlertDialog(
                title: Text('Selected GIF'),
                content: Image.network(gif.url), // Display the selected GIF
                actions: [
                  TextButton(
                    onPressed: () {
                      Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                    },
                    child: Text('Close'),
                  ),
                ],
              );
            },
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to GiphySearchScreen.
// 4. GiphySearchScreen builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a GiphySearch widget.
// 5. The GiphySearch widget takes an API key and a callback function for when a GIF is selected.
// 6. When a GIF is selected, an AlertDialog is shown displaying the selected GIF.
// 7. The user can close the dialog by pressing the 'Close' button.
```
