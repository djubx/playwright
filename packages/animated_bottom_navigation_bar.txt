# Tutorial: Setting Up the Animated Bottom Navigation Bar

In this tutorial, we will walk through the steps to set up and use the `animated_bottom_navigation_bar` package in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `animated_bottom_navigation_bar` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  animated_bottom_navigation_bar: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Import the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the bottom navigation bar, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:animated_bottom_navigation_bar/animated_bottom_navigation_bar.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Setup

You can now set up the `AnimatedBottomNavigationBar` in your widget tree. Below is a simple example of how to implement it:

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Animated Bottom Navigation Bar

You can now use the `AnimatedBottomNavigationBar` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple implementation:

```dart
AnimatedBottomNavigationBar(
  icons: [Icons.home, Icons.search, Icons.notifications, Icons.person],
  activeIndex: _bottomNavIndex,
  onTap: (index) => setState(() => _bottomNavIndex = index),
  backgroundColor: Colors.white,
  activeColor: Colors.blue,
  inactiveColor: Colors.grey,
);
```

This code snippet creates a bottom navigation bar with four icons. The `activeIndex` property determines which icon is currently selected, and the `onTap` callback updates the index when a user taps on an icon.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the `animated_bottom_navigation_bar` package into your Flutter application seamlessly.

# Complete Example of Animated Bottom Navigation Bar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_bottom_navigation_bar/animated_bottom_navigation_bar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to keep track of the currently selected index
  int _bottomNavIndex = 0;

  // List of pages to display for each tab
  final List<Widget> _pages = [
    HomeScreen(),
    SearchScreen(),
    NotificationsScreen(),
    ProfileScreen(),
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Animated Bottom Navigation Bar Example'),
        ),
        body: _pages[_bottomNavIndex], // Display the selected page
        bottomNavigationBar: AnimatedBottomNavigationBar(
          icons: [Icons.home, Icons.search, Icons.notifications, Icons.person],
          activeIndex: _bottomNavIndex, // Current active index
          onTap: (index) {
            // Update the state with the new index
            setState(() {
              _bottomNavIndex = index;
            });
          },
          backgroundColor: Colors.white,
          activeColor: Colors.blue,
          inactiveColor: Colors.grey,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Home screen widget
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(child: Text('Home Screen'));
  }
}

// Search screen widget
class SearchScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(child: Text('Search Screen'));
  }
}

// Notifications screen widget
class NotificationsScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(child: Text('Notifications Screen'));
  }
}

// Profile screen widget
class ProfileScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(child: Text('Profile Screen'));
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the selected bottom navigation index.
// 3. The _pages list contains the different screens to display based on the selected index.
// 4. The AnimatedBottomNavigationBar widget is used to create the bottom navigation bar.
// 5. When a user taps on an icon, the onTap callback updates the _bottomNavIndex, which triggers a rebuild of the widget.
// 6. The body of the Scaffold displays the currently selected page based on the _bottomNavIndex.
