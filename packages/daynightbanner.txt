# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using DayNightBanner

## Installation
To use the daynightbanner package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  daynightbanner: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package
To use the daynightbanner in your Flutter application, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:
   ```dart
   import 'package:daynightbanner/daynightbanner.dart';
   ```

2. Use the `DayNightBanner` widget in your widget tree. You can customize it by providing parameters such as `dayText`, `nightText`, and `backgroundColor`.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
DayNightBanner(
  dayText: 'Good Morning!',
  nightText: 'Good Night!',
  backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
)
```

This will display a banner that greets users with "Good Morning!" during the day and "Good Night!" at night.

# Complete Example of DayNightBanner

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:daynightbanner/daynightbanner.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'DayNightBanner Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('DayNightBanner Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // DayNightBanner widget that changes based on the time of day
              DayNightBanner(
                dayText: 'Good Morning!',
                nightText: 'Good Night!',
                backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
                textColor: Colors.white,
                // Optional: Customize the banner's appearance
                fontSize: 20.0,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              Text(
                'This is a demo of the DayNightBanner package.',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'DayNightBanner Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child widgets.
// 5. A Column widget is used to arrange the DayNightBanner and a Text widget vertically.
// 6. The DayNightBanner widget is instantiated with day and night texts, background color, text color, and font size.
// 7. The banner will automatically switch between the day and night texts based on the current time.
// 8. Below the banner, a Text widget provides additional information about the demo.
