# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Flutter Dialpad Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_dialpad` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_dialpad` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_dialpad: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` file to allow for any necessary permissions, especially if your app will access the phone's dialer.

```xml
<key>NSContactsUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to contacts.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Dialpad

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is an example of how to implement the dial pad in your app.

<!-- END_TUTORIAL -->

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_dialpad/flutter_dialpad.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Dialpad Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: DialPadScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class DialPadScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DialPadScreenState createState() => _DialPadScreenState();
}

class _DialPadScreenState extends State<DialPadScreen> {
  String input = ""; // Variable to hold the input from the dial pad

  // Function to handle button press
  void onButtonPressed(String value) {
    setState(() {
      input += value; // Append the pressed button value to the input
    });
  }

  // Function to clear the input
  void clearInput() {
    setState(() {
      input = ""; // Reset the input variable
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Dial Pad Example'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: [
          // Display the current input
          Text(
            input,
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 32),
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20),
          // Dial pad widget
          DialPad(
            onButtonPressed: onButtonPressed, // Callback for button press
            onClear: clearInput, // Callback for clear button
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home screen is set to DialPadScreen, which is a stateful widget.
// 4. In DialPadScreen, we maintain a string variable 'input' to keep track of the user's input.
// 5. The onButtonPressed function appends the pressed button's value to the input string.
// 6. The clearInput function resets the input string when called.
// 7. The build method constructs the UI, displaying the current input and the dial pad.
// 8. The DialPad widget is configured with callbacks for button presses and clearing input.
```
