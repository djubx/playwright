# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_week_view

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_week_view` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the `flutter_week_view` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_week_view: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_week_view).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `flutter_week_view` in your app.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_week_view/flutter_week_view.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Week View Example',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: WeekViewExample(),
    );
  }
}

class WeekViewExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _WeekViewExampleState createState() => _WeekViewExampleState();
}

class _WeekViewExampleState extends State<WeekViewExample> {
  // Define the events for the week view
  List<WeekViewEvent> events = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize some sample events
    events.add(WeekViewEvent(
      title: 'Meeting with Team',
      description: 'Discuss project updates',
      start: DateTime.now().add(Duration(hours: 1)),
      end: DateTime.now().add(Duration(hours: 2)),
    ));
    events.add(WeekViewEvent(
      title: 'Doctor Appointment',
      description: 'Annual check-up',
      start: DateTime.now().add(Duration(days: 1, hours: 3)),
      end: DateTime.now().add(Duration(days: 1, hours: 4)),
    ));
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Week View Example')),
      body: WeekView(
        // Set the first day of the week
        firstDayOfWeek: DateTime.now(),
        // Set the events to display
        events: events,
        // Define the time slot duration
        timeSlotDuration: Duration(minutes: 30),
        // Customize the appearance
        style: WeekViewStyle(
          backgroundColor: Colors.white,
          eventTextStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
          eventColor: Colors.blue,
        ),
        // Handle event tap
        onEventTap: (event) {
          // Show event details on tap
          showDialog(
            context: context,
            builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
              title: Text(event.title),
              content: Text(event.description),
              actions: [
                TextButton(
                  onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                  child: Text('Close'),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home of the app is set to WeekViewExample, which is a stateful widget.
// 4. In the _WeekViewExampleState, we initialize a list of events in initState.
// 5. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a WeekView widget.
// 6. The WeekView is configured with the current date as the first day of the week, the list of events, and a time slot duration of 30 minutes.
// 7. The appearance of the events is customized using the WeekViewStyle.
// 8. An onEventTap callback is defined to show event details in a dialog when an event is tapped.
