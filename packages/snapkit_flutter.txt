// This is the main application flow
// 
// 1. The user opens the app and is presented with a Snapchat-like camera view.

// 3. When the user takes a photo or video, it is added to the list of snaps.
// 4. The user can view the snaps by scrolling through the list.
// 5. The user can also create a story by pressing the "Create Story" button.
// 6. When the user creates a story, it is displayed in the story view.
// 
// This is the basic flow of the application.
