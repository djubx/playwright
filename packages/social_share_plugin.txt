# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using social_share_plugin

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `social_share_plugin` to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  social_share_plugin: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/social_share_plugin).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that you have the following permissions in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

2. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to share images.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to save images to your photo library.</string>
```

2. Ensure that your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to share text and images.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:social_share_plugin/social_share_plugin.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Social Share Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Share text
                  SocialShare.shareOptions("Check out this amazing app!");
                },
                child: Text('Share Text'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Share an image
                  SocialShare.shareImage("path_to_your_image.png");
                },
                child: Text('Share Image'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app with two buttons: one for sharing text and another for sharing an image. The `SocialShare.shareOptions` method is used to share text, while `SocialShare.shareImage` is used for sharing images.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the `social_share_plugin` into your Flutter application successfully.

                  // Share text using the social_share_plugin
                  SocialShare.shareOptions("Check out this amazing app!");
                },
                child: Text('Share Text'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Share an image using the social_share_plugin
                  SocialShare.shareImage("path_to_your_image.png");
                },
                child: Text('Share Image'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds a Column.
// 4. The Column has two ElevatedButtons:
//    - The first button shares a text message when pressed.
//    - The second button shares an image when pressed.
// 5. The SocialShare methods are called to handle the sharing functionality.
// 6. Users can share content easily with just a button press, enhancing the app's interactivity.
