# Flutter Scripts: A Comprehensive Overview

The `flutter_scripts` package is a powerful tool designed to streamline the development process in Flutter applications. It allows developers to execute Dart scripts directly from their Flutter projects, making it easier to automate tasks, run scripts for data generation, or perform other repetitive tasks without leaving the Flutter environment.

## When to Use `flutter_scripts`
- **Automating Tasks**: If you find yourself running the same Dart scripts repeatedly, this package can help automate those tasks.
- **Data Generation**: Use it to generate mock data or perform data migrations directly within your Flutter app.
- **Development Utilities**: It can be used for various development utilities, such as code generation or running tests.

## Key Features
- **Script Execution**: Run Dart scripts directly from your Flutter application.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate into existing Flutter projects with minimal setup.

Overall, `flutter_scripts` enhances productivity by allowing developers to manage scripts efficiently within their Flutter applications.

# Setting Up and Using `flutter_scripts`

## Installation
To get started with `flutter_scripts`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_scripts: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_scripts).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` to allow script execution. Add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Using the Package
Once installed and configured, you can start using `flutter_scripts` in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to execute a Dart script:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_scripts/flutter_scripts.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Scripts Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Execute a Dart script
              final result = await FlutterScripts.run('path/to/your_script.dart');
              print(result);
            },
            child: Text('Run Script'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, the specified Dart script will be executed, and the result will be printed to the console.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and start using `flutter_scripts` in your Flutter projects effectively.

# Complete Example of `flutter_scripts`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_scripts/flutter_scripts.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Scripts Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Execute a Dart script located at 'scripts/my_script.dart'
              final result = await FlutterScripts.run('scripts/my_script.dart');
              // Print the result of the script execution
              print(result);
            },
            child: Text('Run Script'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget being built.
// 2. A MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is placed.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the onPressed callback is triggered.
// 5. The FlutterScripts.run method is called with the path to the Dart script.
// 6. The result of the script execution is awaited and printed to the console.
// 7. This allows for easy execution of scripts directly from the Flutter app, enhancing productivity.
