<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# h3m_shimmer_card Flutter Package

The `h3m_shimmer_card` package is a Flutter library designed to create shimmering effect cards that enhance the user interface by providing a loading placeholder. This package is particularly useful in applications where data is fetched asynchronously, allowing developers to maintain a smooth user experience while waiting for content to load.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `h3m_shimmer_card` package in scenarios such as:
- **Data Loading**: When fetching data from APIs, you can use shimmer cards to indicate that content is being loaded.
- **Image Loading**: While images are being fetched from the network, shimmer cards can provide a visual cue to users.
- **Placeholder UI**: For any part of your app where content is not immediately available, shimmer cards can serve as placeholders.

## Features

- **Customizable**: You can easily customize the shimmer effect, including colors, shapes, and sizes.
- **Performance**: The package is optimized for performance, ensuring that the shimmer effect does not hinder the app's responsiveness.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate into existing Flutter applications with minimal setup.

Overall, the `h3m_shimmer_card` package is a powerful tool for enhancing the user experience in Flutter applications by providing visually appealing loading indicators.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using h3m_shimmer_card

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `h3m_shimmer_card` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  h3m_shimmer_card: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a shimmer card.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:h3m_shimmer_card/h3m_shimmer_card.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Shimmer Card Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ShimmerCard(
            width: 300,
            height: 200,
            borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(15),
            child: Container(
              color: Colors.white,
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays a shimmer card in the center of the screen. The `ShimmerCard` widget is used to create the shimmering effect.

# Complete Example of h3m_shimmer_card

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:h3m_shimmer_card/h3m_shimmer_card.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Shimmer Card Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Center widget to align the shimmer card in the middle of the screen
          child: ShimmerCard(
            width: 300, // Width of the shimmer card
            height: 200, // Height of the shimmer card
            borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(15), // Rounded corners
            child: Container(
              color: Colors.white, // Background color of the card
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Entry point of the application
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the Flutter application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the UI.
// 3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// 4. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Shimmer Card Example'.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold has a Center widget that centers its child.
// 6. The child of the Center widget is a ShimmerCard, which creates a shimmering effect.
// 7. The ShimmerCard has a specified width, height, and rounded corners.
// 8. The child of the ShimmerCard is a Container with a white background, which serves as the placeholder.
// 9. When the app runs, users will see a shimmering card in the center of the screen, indicating loading content.
```
