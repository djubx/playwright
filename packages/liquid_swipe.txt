# Tutorial: Setting Up the Liquid Swipe Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To use the **liquid_swipe** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  liquid_swipe: ^2.0.0
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to set the platform version in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage
Now that you have the package installed, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the **liquid_swipe** package.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:liquid_swipe/liquid_swipe.dart';
```

2. Create a list of pages that you want to swipe through. Each page can be a widget of your choice.

3. Use the `LiquidSwipe` widget to wrap your pages.

### Example Code Snippet
```dart
LiquidSwipe(
  pages: [
    Container(color: Colors.red),
    Container(color: Colors.green),
    Container(color: Colors.blue),
  ],
)
```

This will create a simple liquid swipe effect between three colored pages.

# Complete Example of Liquid Swipe

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:liquid_swipe/liquid_swipe.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Liquid Swipe Example',
      home: LiquidSwipeExample(),
    );
  }
}

class LiquidSwipeExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a list of pages to swipe through
    final pages = [
      Container(
        color: Colors.red,
        child: Center(child: Text('Page 1', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 30, color: Colors.white))),
      ),
      Container(
        color: Colors.green,
        child: Center(child: Text('Page 2', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 30, color: Colors.white))),
      ),
      Container(
        color: Colors.blue,
        child: Center(child: Text('Page 3', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 30, color: Colors.white))),
      ),
    ];

    // Return the LiquidSwipe widget with the pages
    return Scaffold(
      body: LiquidSwipe(
        pages: pages,
        enableLoop: true, // Enable looping through pages
        fullTransitionValue: 600, // Set the transition value
        initialPage: 0, // Start on the first page
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and home set to LiquidSwipeExample.
// 3. LiquidSwipeExample is another StatelessWidget that builds the main content of the app.
// 4. Inside LiquidSwipeExample, we create a list of Container widgets, each representing a page with a different color and text.
// 5. The LiquidSwipe widget is used to create the swipe effect, with the pages passed as a parameter.
// 6. The enableLoop property allows users to loop back to the first page after reaching the last one.
// 7. The fullTransitionValue controls the distance of the swipe transition, and the initialPage sets the starting page.
```
