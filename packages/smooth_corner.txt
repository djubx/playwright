# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Smooth Corner Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the **smooth_corner** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  smooth_corner: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:smooth_corner/smooth_corner.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using SmoothCorner Widget

You can now use the `SmoothCorner` widget to create rounded corners. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use it:

```dart
SmoothCorner(
  borderRadius: 20.0, // Set the desired radius
  child: Container(
    color: Colors.blue,
    height: 100,
    width: 100,
    child: Center(child: Text('Rounded Corner')),
  ),
);
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid any compatibility issues:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Optimizations

- **Performance**: Use the `SmoothCorner` widget judiciously, especially in lists or grids, to maintain smooth scrolling performance.
- **Testing**: Test on both Android and iOS devices to ensure consistent appearance and performance.

# Complete Example of Using Smooth Corner

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:smooth_corner/smooth_corner.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Smooth Corner Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Smooth Corner Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: SmoothCorner(
            borderRadius: 30.0, // Set the radius for rounded corners
            child: Container(
              color: Colors.green, // Background color of the container
              height: 200, // Height of the container
              width: 200, // Width of the container
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'Hello, Smooth Corner!',
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20), // Text style
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Smooth Corner Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers a SmoothCorner widget.
// 5. The SmoothCorner widget wraps a Container with a green background, specified height and width, and rounded corners.
// 6. Inside the Container, a Text widget displays 'Hello, Smooth Corner!' in white color.
// 7. The application showcases the smooth corner effect on the container, enhancing the UI.
