# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the pdf_text Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the `pdf_text` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  pdf_text: ^0.9.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you plan to access files from the device storage:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to select PDF files.</string>
<key>NSDocumentsFolderUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your documents to select PDF files.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the pdf_text Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to load a PDF file and extract text from it.

# Complete Example: Using the pdf_text Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pdf_text/pdf_text.dart';
import 'package:file_picker/file_picker.dart'; // For file picking

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'PDF Text Extractor',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: PDFTextExtractor(),
    );
  }
}

class PDFTextExtractor extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PDFTextExtractorState createState() => _PDFTextExtractorState();
}

class _PDFTextExtractorState extends State<PDFTextExtractor> {
  String _extractedText = "Select a PDF file to extract text.";
  
  // Function to pick a PDF file
  Future<void> _pickPDF() async {
    // Use file_picker to select a PDF file
    FilePickerResult? result = await FilePicker.platform.pickFiles(
      type: FileType.custom,
      allowedExtensions: ['pdf'],
    );

    // Check if a file was selected
    if (result != null) {
      // Get the file path
      String filePath = result.files.single.path!;
      // Extract text from the PDF file
      _extractTextFromPDF(filePath);
    }
  }

  // Function to extract text from the PDF file
  Future<void> _extractTextFromPDF(String filePath) async {
    // Use the pdf_text package to extract text
    PDFDoc doc = await PDFDoc.fromPath(filePath);
    String text = await doc.text; // Extract the text
    setState(() {
      _extractedText = text; // Update the state with the extracted text
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('PDF Text Extractor'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              _extractedText,
              textAlign: TextAlign.center,
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _pickPDF, // Call the function to pick a PDF
              child: Text('Pick PDF File'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home as PDFTextExtractor.
// 3. PDFTextExtractor is a stateful widget that manages the state of the extracted text.
// 4. When the user taps the "Pick PDF File" button, the _pickPDF function is called.
// 5. The _pickPDF function uses the file_picker package to allow the user to select a PDF file.
// 6. If a file is selected, the file path is passed to the _extractTextFromPDF function.
// 7. The _extractTextFromPDF function uses the pdf_text package to extract text from the PDF file.
// 8. The extracted text is then displayed in the center of the screen.
