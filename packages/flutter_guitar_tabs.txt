# flutter_guitar_tabs: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the `flutter_guitar_tabs` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_guitar_tabs: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` if your app requires internet access or other features. However, for basic usage of `flutter_guitar_tabs`, no additional configuration is typically required.

## Basic Usage
To use the `flutter_guitar_tabs` package, you can create a simple widget that displays a guitar tab. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_guitar_tabs/flutter_guitar_tabs.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Guitar Tabs Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: GuitarTab(
            tab: 'e|---0---|---2---|---3---|\nB|---1---|---3---|---0---|\nG|---0---|---2---|---0---|\nD|---2---|---0---|---0---|\nA|---3---|-------|-------|\nE|-------|-------|-------|',
            tuning: 'Standard E',
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays a guitar tab in standard tuning. The `GuitarTab` widget takes a string representation of the tab and the tuning as parameters.

This setup provides a straightforward way to integrate guitar tabs into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of flutter_guitar_tabs

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_guitar_tabs/flutter_guitar_tabs.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Guitar Tabs Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Centering the GuitarTab widget in the middle of the screen
          child: GuitarTab(
            // The guitar tab string representation
            tab: 'e|---0---|---2---|---3---|\nB|---1---|---3---|---0---|\nG|---0---|---2---|---0---|\nD|---2---|---0---|---0---|\nA|---3---|-------|-------|\nE|-------|-------|-------|',
            // Specifying the tuning of the guitar
            tuning: 'Standard E',
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  // Entry point of the application
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The main function is the entry point of the Flutter application.
2. The runApp function initializes the app and takes the RealFlutter widget as the root widget.
3. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp, which provides the app structure.
4. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold widget is created, which provides the basic visual layout structure.
5. An AppBar is added to the Scaffold with the title 'Guitar Tabs Example'.
6. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget, which centers its child widget.
7. The child of the Center widget is the GuitarTab widget, which displays the guitar tab.
8. The GuitarTab widget takes a string representation of the tab and the tuning as parameters, rendering the tab on the screen.
