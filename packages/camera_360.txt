# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Camera_360 Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `camera_360` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  camera_360: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the current version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version
    }
}
```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys for camera usage:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to capture 360-degree images.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save images.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that the package is set up, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to initialize the camera and capture a 360-degree image.

# Complete Example of Using the Camera_360 Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:camera_360/camera_360.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  Camera360Controller? _controller; // Controller for the camera
  bool _isCameraInitialized = false; // Flag to check if camera is initialized

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _initializeCamera(); // Initialize the camera when the app starts
  }

  // Method to initialize the camera
  Future<void> _initializeCamera() async {
    _controller = Camera360Controller(); // Create a new camera controller
    await _controller!.initialize(); // Initialize the camera
    setState(() {
      _isCameraInitialized = true; // Update the state to reflect camera initialization
    });
  }

  // Method to capture a 360-degree image
  Future<void> _captureImage() async {
    if (_controller != null) {
      final image = await _controller!.takePicture(); // Capture the image
      // Save or process the image as needed
      print('Image captured: ${image.path}'); // Log the image path
    }
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _controller?.dispose(); // Dispose of the camera controller when not needed
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Camera 360 Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: _isCameraInitialized
              ? Column(
                  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
                  children: [
                    // Display the camera preview
                    Camera360Preview(controller: _controller!),
                    SizedBox(height: 20),
                    ElevatedButton(
                      onPressed: _captureImage, // Capture image on button press
                      child: Text('Capture 360 Image'),
                    ),
                  ],
                )
              : CircularProgressIndicator(), // Show loading indicator while initializing
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application using the camera_360 package.
// 1. The app initializes the camera in the initState method.
// 2. A Camera360Controller is created and initialized.
// 3. The camera preview is displayed using Camera360Preview widget.
// 4. A button is provided to capture a 360-degree image.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the _captureImage method is called, which captures the image and logs its path.
// 6. The camera controller is disposed of in the dispose method to free up resources when the widget is removed from the tree.
