## Part 2: Tutorial

```markdown
<!-- START_TUTORIAL -->
# Setting Up the flutter_signin_button Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_signin_button` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_signin_button` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_signin_button: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install Packages

Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` file to allow for social sign-in. Add the following keys:

```xml
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
    <dict>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
        <array>
            <string>YOUR_REVERSED_CLIENT_ID</string> <!-- Replace with your reversed client ID -->
        </array>
    </dict>
</array>
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is an example of how to implement the sign-in buttons.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_signin_button/flutter_signin_button.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Sign In Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Google Sign-In Button
              SignInButton(
                Buttons.Google,
                onPressed: () {
                  // Handle Google Sign-In
                },
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Facebook Sign-In Button
              SignInButton(
                Buttons.Facebook,
                onPressed: () {
                  // Handle Facebook Sign-In
                },
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Email Sign-In Button
              SignInButton(
                Buttons.Email,
                onPressed: () {
                  // Handle Email Sign-In
                },
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with three sign-in buttons: Google, Facebook, and Email. Each button has an `onPressed` callback where you can implement the authentication logic.

That's it! You have successfully set up and used the `flutter_signin_button` package in your Flutter application.

## Part 3: Complete Example

<!-- START_MAIN -->
# Complete Example of flutter_signin_button

Below is a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates all key features of the `flutter_signin_button` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_signin_button/flutter_signin_button.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sign In Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Sign In Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Google Sign-In Button
              SignInButton(
                Buttons.Google,
                onPressed: () {
                  // Handle Google Sign-In
                  print('Google Sign-In pressed');
                },
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Add space between buttons
              // Facebook Sign-In Button
              SignInButton(
                Buttons.Facebook,
                onPressed: () {
                  // Handle Facebook Sign-In
                  print('Facebook Sign-In pressed');
                },
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Add space between buttons
              // Email Sign-In Button
              SignInButton(
                Buttons.Email,
                onPressed: () {
                  // Handle Email Sign-In
                  print('Email Sign-In pressed');
                },
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Sign In Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Column widget.
// 5. Inside the Column, three SignInButton widgets are created for Google, Facebook, and Email sign-in.
// 6. Each button has an onPressed callback that currently prints a message to the console when pressed.
// 7. The SizedBox widget is used to add space between the buttons for better visual separation.
