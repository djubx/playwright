# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the User Profile Avatar Package

## Installation
To use the `user_profile_avatar` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  user_profile_avatar: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/user_profile_avatar).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No specific configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if you plan to access the user's photo library. Add the following keys:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to display your profile picture.</string>
```

## Using the Package
Once the package is installed, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the `UserProfileAvatar` widget.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:user_profile_avatar/user_profile_avatar.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('User Profile Avatar Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: UserProfileAvatar(
            imageUrl: 'https://example.com/user_image.png', // URL of the user's image
            initials: 'AB', // Initials to display if image fails
            size: 100.0, // Size of the avatar
            shape: BoxShape.circle, // Shape of the avatar
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays a user profile avatar in the center of the screen. The `UserProfileAvatar` widget takes an image URL, initials, size, and shape as parameters.

# Complete Example of User Profile Avatar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:user_profile_avatar/user_profile_avatar.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('User Profile Avatar Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Center widget to align the avatar in the middle of the screen
          child: UserProfileAvatar(
            imageUrl: 'https://example.com/user_image.png', // URL of the user's image
            initials: 'AB', // Initials to display if image fails
            size: 100.0, // Size of the avatar
            shape: BoxShape.circle, // Shape of the avatar
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Entry point of the application
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the Flutter application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the main UI.
// 3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// 4. The AppBar displays the title of the application.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 6. The UserProfileAvatar widget is used to display the user's avatar.
// 7. The avatar is configured with an image URL, initials, size, and shape.
// 8. If the image fails to load, the initials 'AB' will be displayed instead.
// 9. The application runs and displays the user profile avatar in the center of the screen.
