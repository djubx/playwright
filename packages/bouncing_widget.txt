# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Bouncing Widget

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started with the **bouncing_widget** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  bouncing_widget: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package
In your Dart file where you want to use the bouncing widget, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:bouncing_widget/bouncing_widget.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Bouncing Widget
You can now wrap any widget with the `BouncingWidget` class. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use it with a button:

```dart
BouncingWidget(
  onPressed: () {
    // Action to perform on button press
  },
  child: Container(
    padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
    decoration: BoxDecoration(
      color: Colors.blue,
      borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(8.0),
    ),
    child: Text(
      'Click Me',
      style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
    ),
  ),
)
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Optimizations
- **Performance**: Use the bouncing effect sparingly to avoid overwhelming users with too many animations.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure that the bouncing effect does not interfere with accessibility features, such as screen readers.

With these steps, you should be able to successfully integrate and use the **bouncing_widget** package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Bouncing Widget

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bouncing_widget/bouncing_widget.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Bouncing Widget Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Bouncing Widget Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: BouncingWidget(
            onPressed: () {
              // Action to perform on button press
              ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                SnackBar(content: Text('Button Pressed!')),
              );
            },
            child: Container(
              padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
              decoration: BoxDecoration(
                color: Colors.blue,
                borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(8.0),
              ),
              child: Text(
                'Click Me',
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a BouncingWidget wraps a Container.
// 5. The Container has padding, a blue background, and a rounded border.
// 6. When the BouncingWidget is pressed, it triggers the onPressed callback.
// 7. The onPressed callback shows a SnackBar with the message 'Button Pressed!'.
// 8. The app demonstrates the bouncing effect on the button when pressed, enhancing user interaction.
