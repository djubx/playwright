# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Anchor Scroll Controller

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `anchor_scroll_controller` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  anchor_scroll_controller: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:anchor_scroll_controller/anchor_scroll_controller.dart';
```

## Step 3: Setting Up the Controller

You will need to create an instance of `AnchorScrollController` in your main widget. Here’s how to do it:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late AnchorScrollController _scrollController;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _scrollController = AnchorScrollController();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _scrollController.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Using the Controller in a Scrollable Widget

You can now use the `_scrollController` in a scrollable widget, such as a `ListView`. Here’s an example:

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Anchor Scroll Example')),
    body: ListView.builder(
      controller: _scrollController,
      itemCount: 100,
      itemBuilder: (context, index) {
        return ListTile(
          title: Text('Item $index'),
          onTap: () {
            // Scroll to the tapped item
            _scrollController.scrollTo(index);
          },
        );
      },
    ),
  );
}
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Optimizations

- **Performance**: For large lists, consider using `ListView.builder` to improve performance.
- **Animations**: Customize the scroll animations to match your app's theme for a cohesive user experience.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the `anchor_scroll_controller` package into your Flutter application seamlessly.

# Complete Example of Anchor Scroll Controller

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:anchor_scroll_controller/anchor_scroll_controller.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Step 1: Create an instance of AnchorScrollController
  late AnchorScrollController _scrollController;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Step 2: Initialize the scroll controller
    _scrollController = AnchorScrollController();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Step 3: Dispose of the controller when done
    _scrollController.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Anchor Scroll Example')),
      body: ListView.builder(
        // Step 4: Use the controller in a ListView
        controller: _scrollController,
        itemCount: 100,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return ListTile(
            title: Text('Item $index'),
            onTap: () {
              // Step 5: Scroll to the tapped item
              _scrollController.scrollTo(index);
            },
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 2. In the initState method, we initialize the AnchorScrollController.
// 3. The ListView.builder creates a scrollable list of items.
// 4. Each ListTile has an onTap callback that triggers the scrollTo method of the controller.
// 5. When an item is tapped, the list smoothly scrolls to that item, enhancing user experience.
```

In this blog, we explored the `anchor_scroll_controller` package, detailing its features, setup, and providing a complete example. The application flow is straightforward: it initializes a scroll controller, builds a list of items, and allows users to scroll to specific items with a tap, creating a smooth and interactive experience.
