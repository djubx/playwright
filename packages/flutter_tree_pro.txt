Here's a detailed technical blog on the "flutter_tree_pro" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Flutter Tree Pro Package

The **flutter_tree_pro** package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to implement tree structures in their applications. This package provides a flexible and customizable way to display hierarchical data, making it ideal for applications that require tree-like representations, such as file explorers, organizational charts, or any data that can be represented in a parent-child relationship.

## When to Use flutter_tree_pro

You should consider using the **flutter_tree_pro** package when:
- You need to display hierarchical data in a user-friendly manner.
- You want to implement features like expandable/collapsible nodes.
- You require customization options for node appearance and behavior.

## Key Features
- **Customizable Nodes**: Easily customize the appearance of tree nodes.
- **Expandable/Collapsible Functionality**: Users can expand or collapse nodes to view or hide child nodes.
- **Dynamic Data Handling**: Supports dynamic updates to the tree structure, allowing for real-time data representation.
- **Platform Compatibility**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

By leveraging the **flutter_tree_pro** package, developers can create intuitive and interactive tree structures that enhance user experience.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_tree_pro

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **flutter_tree_pro** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **flutter_tree_pro** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_tree_pro: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration
For iOS, ensure that your `ios/Podfile` has the platform set to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple tree structure. Below is an example of how to implement the **flutter_tree_pro** package in your Flutter application.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_tree_pro/flutter_tree_pro.dart';
```

2. Create a simple tree structure using the `RealFlutter` class:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Tree Pro Example')),
        body: TreeView(
          nodes: [
            TreeNode(
              content: Text('Root Node'),
              children: [
                TreeNode(
                  content: Text('Child Node 1'),
                  children: [
                    TreeNode(content: Text('Grandchild Node 1')),
                    TreeNode(content: Text('Grandchild Node 2')),
                  ],
                ),
                TreeNode(content: Text('Child Node 2')),
              ],
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Run your application using `flutter run`.

This will create a simple tree view with a root node and two child nodes, each with their own children.

# Complete Example of flutter_tree_pro

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart'; // Importing Flutter material package
import 'package:flutter_tree_pro/flutter_tree_pro.dart'; // Importing the flutter_tree_pro package

// Main entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the RealFlutter widget
}

// RealFlutter class that builds the main application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Tree Pro Example')), // App bar with title
        body: TreeView( // Creating a TreeView widget
          nodes: [ // Defining the nodes of the tree
            TreeNode(
              content: Text('Root Node'), // Root node
              children: [ // Children of the root node
                TreeNode(
                  content: Text('Child Node 1'), // First child node
                  children: [ // Children of the first child node
                    TreeNode(content: Text('Grandchild Node 1')), // First grandchild
                    TreeNode(content: Text('Grandchild Node 2')), // Second grandchild
                  ],
                ),
                TreeNode(content: Text('Child Node 2')), // Second child node
              ],
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application, which calls runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a TreeView.
// 3. The TreeView is populated with a root node and its children, demonstrating a simple hierarchical structure.
// 4. Each TreeNode can be expanded or collapsed, allowing users to navigate through the tree structure easily.
```
