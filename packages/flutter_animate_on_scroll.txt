# Tutorial: Setting Up flutter_animate_on_scroll

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_animate_on_scroll` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_animate_on_scroll` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_animate_on_scroll: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install Packages

Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # Ensure this is set to at least 10.0
```

## Step 4: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_animate_on_scroll/flutter_animate_on_scroll.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package

You can now use the `AnimateOnScroll` widget to wrap any widget you want to animate. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
AnimateOnScroll(
  child: Text('Hello, Flutter!'),
  duration: Duration(milliseconds: 500),
  animationType: AnimationType.fadeIn,
),
```

This will animate the text to fade in as it comes into view when the user scrolls.

With these steps, you are now ready to implement scroll-based animations in your Flutter application using the `flutter_animate_on_scroll` package.

# Complete Example of flutter_animate_on_scroll

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_animate_on_scroll/flutter_animate_on_scroll.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animate on Scroll Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Animate on Scroll Example'),
        ),
        body: SingleChildScrollView(
          child: Column(
            children: List.generate(20, (index) {
              // Each item in the list will be animated on scroll
              return AnimateOnScroll(
                child: Container(
                  margin: EdgeInsets.all(10),
                  padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
                  color: Colors.blueAccent,
                  child: Text(
                    'Item $index',
                    style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
                  ),
                ),
                duration: Duration(milliseconds: 500), // Animation duration
                animationType: AnimationType.fadeIn, // Type of animation
              );
            }),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Animate on Scroll Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is a SingleChildScrollView, allowing vertical scrolling.
// 5. Inside the SingleChildScrollView, a Column widget generates a list of 20 items.
// 6. Each item is wrapped in the AnimateOnScroll widget, which triggers a fade-in animation when the item comes into view.
// 7. The Container for each item has a blue background and white text, making it visually distinct.
// 8. As the user scrolls down, each item will animate into view, enhancing the user experience.
```
