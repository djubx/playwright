# Metronome Flutter Package

The **metronome** Flutter package is a powerful tool designed for developers looking to integrate metronome functionality into their Flutter applications. This package is particularly useful for music applications, practice tools, and any scenario where timing is crucial. 

## When to Use This Package
You might consider using the metronome package in scenarios such as:
- **Music Practice Apps**: To help musicians keep time while practicing.
- **Games**: Where timing and rhythm are essential.
- **Educational Tools**: For teaching music theory or rhythm exercises.

## Features
- **Customizable Beats Per Minute (BPM)**: Set the tempo according to your needs.
- **Sound Options**: Choose from different sound cues for beats.
- **Visual Indicators**: Display visual cues alongside audio for better synchronization.
- **Start/Stop Functionality**: Easily control the metronome with start and stop commands.

The metronome package is a versatile tool that can enhance the user experience in any application requiring precise timing.

# Tutorial: Setting Up the Metronome Package

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the metronome package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, you need to add the metronome package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  metronome: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install the Package
Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable background audio capabilities if you want the metronome to continue playing when the app is in the background. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>audio</string>
</array>
```

## Step 4: Import the Package
In your Dart file, import the metronome package:

```dart
import 'package:metronome/metronome.dart';
```

## Step 5: Basic Usage
You can now create an instance of the metronome and control it. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to start and stop the metronome:

```dart
final metronome = Metronome();
metronome.start(bpm: 120); // Start metronome at 120 BPM
// To stop the metronome
metronome.stop();
```

With these steps, you are ready to integrate the metronome functionality into your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Using the Metronome Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:metronome/metronome.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Metronome Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MetronomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MetronomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MetronomePageState createState() => _MetronomePageState();
}

class _MetronomePageState extends State<MetronomePage> {
  final Metronome _metronome = Metronome(); // Create an instance of the Metronome
  bool _isPlaying = false; // Track if the metronome is currently playing
  int _bpm = 120; // Default BPM

  // Function to start the metronome
  void _startMetronome() {
    _metronome.start(bpm: _bpm); // Start the metronome at the specified BPM
    setState(() {
      _isPlaying = true; // Update the state to reflect that the metronome is playing
    });
  }

  // Function to stop the metronome
  void _stopMetronome() {
    _metronome.stop(); // Stop the metronome
    setState(() {
      _isPlaying = false; // Update the state to reflect that the metronome is stopped
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Metronome'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('BPM: $_bpm'), // Display the current BPM
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _isPlaying ? _stopMetronome : _startMetronome, // Toggle start/stop
              child: Text(_isPlaying ? 'Stop' : 'Start'), // Button text changes based on state
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Slider(
              value: _bpm.toDouble(), // Set the slider value to the current BPM
              min: 40, // Minimum BPM
              max: 208, // Maximum BPM
              divisions: 168, // Number of divisions in the slider
              label: 'Set BPM',
              onChanged: (value) {
                setState(() {
                  _bpm = value.toInt(); // Update BPM based on slider value
                });
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme, and sets MetronomePage as the home.
// 3. MetronomePage is a StatefulWidget that manages the state of the metronome.
// 4. The _MetronomePageState class creates an instance of the Metronome and tracks whether it is playing.
// 5. The build method constructs the UI, displaying the current BPM, a start/stop button, and a slider to adjust the BPM.
// 6. When the button is pressed, it toggles between starting and stopping the metronome.
// 7. The slider allows users to adjust the BPM dynamically, updating the state accordingly.
```
