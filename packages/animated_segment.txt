# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Animated Segment

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `animated_segment` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  animated_segment: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Animated Segment

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `animated_segment` in your app.

# Complete Example of Animated Segment

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_segment/animated_segment.dart'; // Import the package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the main app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animated Segment Example',
      home: AnimatedSegmentExample(), // Home widget
    );
  }
}

class AnimatedSegmentExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _AnimatedSegmentExampleState createState() => _AnimatedSegmentExampleState();
}

class _AnimatedSegmentExampleState extends State<AnimatedSegmentExample> {
  int _selectedSegment = 0; // Variable to track the selected segment

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Animated Segment Example'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: [
          // AnimatedSegment widget
          AnimatedSegment(
            segments: [
              'Segment 1', // First segment
              'Segment 2', // Second segment
              'Segment 3', // Third segment
            ],
            selectedIndex: _selectedSegment, // Current selected index
            onSegmentTapped: (index) {
              setState(() {
                _selectedSegment = index; // Update selected segment
              });
            },
            backgroundColor: Colors.grey[200], // Background color
            selectedColor: Colors.blue, // Selected segment color
            unselectedColor: Colors.white, // Unselected segment color
            borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(10), // Rounded corners
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between segment and text
          Text(
            'Selected Segment: ${_selectedSegment + 1}', // Display selected segment
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24), // Text style
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home widget.
// 3. AnimatedSegmentExample is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the selected segment.
// 4. The build method of AnimatedSegmentExample creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Column.
// 5. Inside the Column, the AnimatedSegment widget is created with three segments.
// 6. The selected segment is tracked by the _selectedSegment variable, which updates when a segment is tapped.
// 7. The selected segment index is displayed below the AnimatedSegment, showing the user which segment is currently active.
```
