Here's a detailed technical blog on the "chunked_uploader" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Description

The `chunked_uploader` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to facilitate the uploading of large files in smaller, manageable chunks. This approach not only enhances the reliability of file uploads but also improves the user experience by allowing uploads to resume from the last successful chunk in case of interruptions. 

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `chunked_uploader` package in scenarios such as:

- **Uploading Large Files**: When dealing with files that exceed typical size limits for uploads, chunking allows for smoother uploads.
- **Unstable Network Conditions**: In environments where network connectivity is unreliable, chunked uploads can help ensure that uploads can resume without starting over.
- **User Experience**: Providing feedback to users about the upload progress can enhance the overall experience, especially for large files.

## Features

- **Chunked Uploading**: Automatically splits files into smaller chunks for upload.
- **Resume Capability**: Supports resuming uploads from the last successful chunk.
- **Progress Tracking**: Provides real-time feedback on upload progress.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.

By leveraging these features, developers can create robust applications that handle file uploads efficiently and effectively.

# Tutorial

## Setup Process

To get started with the `chunked_uploader` package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the `chunked_uploader` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  chunked_uploader: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

### Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

3. Add internet permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

#### iOS

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to allow network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

### Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:chunked_uploader/chunked_uploader.dart';
```

## Using the Package

### Basic Usage Example

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the `chunked_uploader` package to upload a file:

```dart
void uploadFile(String filePath) async {
  // Create an instance of the uploader
  final uploader = ChunkedUploader(
    url: 'https://yourapi.com/upload', // Your upload endpoint
    filePath: filePath,
    chunkSize: 1024 * 1024, // 1 MB chunks
  );

  // Start the upload
  uploader.upload().listen((progress) {
    // Handle progress updates
    print('Uploaded: ${progress.bytesUploaded} bytes');
  }, onDone: () {
    // Handle completion
    print('Upload complete!');
  }, onError: (error) {
    // Handle errors
    print('Upload failed: $error');
  });
}
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to initialize the `ChunkedUploader`, specify the upload URL, and handle progress updates, completion, and errors.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:chunked_uploader/chunked_uploader.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Chunked Uploader Example',
      home: UploadPage(),
    );
  }
}

class UploadPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _UploadPageState createState() => _UploadPageState();
}

class _UploadPageState extends State<UploadPage> {
  double _progress = 0.0; // Variable to track upload progress

  // Function to handle file upload
  void _uploadFile(String filePath) async {
    final uploader = ChunkedUploader(
      url: 'https://yourapi.com/upload', // Your upload endpoint
      filePath: filePath,
      chunkSize: 1024 * 1024, // 1 MB chunks
    );

    // Start the upload
    uploader.upload().listen((progress) {
      // Update progress state
      setState(() {
        _progress = progress.bytesUploaded / progress.totalBytes; // Calculate progress percentage
      });
    }, onDone: () {
      // Handle completion
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Upload complete!')),
      );
    }, onError: (error) {
      // Handle errors
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Upload failed: $error')),
      );
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Chunked Uploader')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            LinearProgressIndicator(value: _progress), // Display upload progress
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Trigger file upload (replace with actual file path)
                _uploadFile('/path/to/your/file.txt');
              },
              child: Text('Upload File'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The UploadPage widget is displayed, containing a LinearProgressIndicator and a button.
// 3. When the button is pressed, the _uploadFile function is called with a specified file path.
// 4. The ChunkedUploader is initialized with the upload URL and file path.
// 5. The upload starts, and progress updates are received in real-time.
// 6. The progress is updated on the UI using setState, reflecting the upload status.
// 7. Upon completion or error, a SnackBar message is displayed to inform the user.
```
