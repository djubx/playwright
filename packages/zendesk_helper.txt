# Tutorial: Setting Up the Zendesk Helper Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `zendesk_helper` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `zendesk_helper` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  zendesk_helper: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the required permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. Ensure your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Initialize the Package

In your main application file, initialize the `zendesk_helper` package with your Zendesk credentials:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:zendesk_helper/zendesk_helper.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Zendesk Helper Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the package to create tickets, initiate live chats, and access the help center. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a support ticket:

```dart
void createSupportTicket() {
  ZendeskHelper.createTicket(
    subject: "Issue with the app",
    description: "I am facing an issue with the app functionality.",
    onSuccess: (ticketId) {
      print("Ticket created successfully: $ticketId");
    },
    onError: (error) {
      print("Error creating ticket: $error");
    },
  );
}
```

This function can be called from a button press or any other event in your app.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the `zendesk_helper` package in your Flutter application effectively.

# Complete Example of Using the Zendesk Helper Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:zendesk_helper/zendesk_helper.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Zendesk Helper Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Zendesk Helper Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                createSupportTicket();
              },
              child: Text('Create Support Ticket'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                openHelpCenter();
              },
              child: Text('Open Help Center'),
            },
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to create a support ticket
  void createSupportTicket() {
    ZendeskHelper.createTicket(
      subject: "Issue with the app",
      description: "I am facing an issue with the app functionality.",
      onSuccess: (ticketId) {
        print("Ticket created successfully: $ticketId");
      },
      onError: (error) {
        print("Error creating ticket: $error");
      },
    );
  }

  // Function to open the help center
  void openHelpCenter() {
    ZendeskHelper.openHelpCenter(
      onSuccess: () {
        print("Help center opened successfully.");
      },
      onError: (error) {
        print("Error opening help center: $error");
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a HomeScreen as its home.
// 3. The HomeScreen contains two buttons: one for creating a support ticket and another for opening the help center.
// 4. When the "Create Support Ticket" button is pressed, the createSupportTicket function is called.
// 5. This function uses the ZendeskHelper to create a ticket with a subject and description.
// 6. On success, it prints the ticket ID; on error, it prints the error message.
// 7. When the "Open Help Center" button is pressed, the openHelpCenter function is called.
// 8. This function opens the Zendesk help center, printing success or error messages accordingly.
```
