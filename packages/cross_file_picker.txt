# Overview of the cross_file_picker Flutter Package

The `cross_file_picker` package is a versatile Flutter plugin that allows developers to easily pick files from the device's file system across multiple platforms, including Android, iOS, and web. This package is particularly useful when you need to implement file selection functionality in your Flutter applications, such as uploading documents, images, or any other file types.

## When to Use `cross_file_picker`
- **File Uploads**: When your app requires users to upload files, such as images or documents.
- **Document Management**: For applications that manage or display documents, allowing users to select files from their device.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: When you want a consistent file-picking experience across different platforms.

## Key Features
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on Android, iOS, and web.
- **Multiple File Types**: Supports various file types, including images, videos, and documents.
- **Customizable UI**: Allows developers to customize the file picker interface to match their app's design.
- **Asynchronous File Handling**: Utilizes Dart's async features for smooth file handling without blocking the UI.

# Setting Up and Using the cross_file_picker Package

## Installation
To use the `cross_file_picker` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  cross_file_picker: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/cross_file_picker).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

2. Ensure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21.

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request permission to access files:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to upload images.</string>
<key>NSDocumentDirectoryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your documents to upload files.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `cross_file_picker`, you can follow these steps in your Flutter application:

1. Import the package:

```dart
import 'package:cross_file_picker/cross_file_picker.dart';
```

2. Create a method to pick files:

```dart
Future<void> pickFiles() async {
  try {
    final List<XFile>? files = await FilePicker.platform.pickFiles();
    if (files != null) {
      // Handle the selected files
    }
  } catch (e) {
    // Handle any errors
  }
}
```

3. Call this method from a button or any other UI element in your app.

# Complete Example of Using cross_file_picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cross_file_picker/cross_file_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Cross File Picker Example',
      home: FilePickerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class FilePickerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _FilePickerScreenState createState() => _FilePickerScreenState();
}

class _FilePickerScreenState extends State<FilePickerScreen> {
  List<XFile>? _selectedFiles; // Variable to hold selected files

  // Method to pick files
  Future<void> pickFiles() async {
    try {
      // Open the file picker
      final List<XFile>? files = await FilePicker.platform.pickFiles();
      if (files != null) {
        setState(() {
          _selectedFiles = files; // Update the state with selected files
        });
      }
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during file picking
      print("Error picking files: $e");
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('File Picker Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: pickFiles, // Call the pickFiles method on button press
              child: Text('Pick Files'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Display selected files
            _selectedFiles != null
                ? Column(
                    children: _selectedFiles!.map((file) {
                      return Text(file.name); // Show the name of each selected file
                    }).toList(),
                  )
                : Text('No files selected'), // Message when no files are selected
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```
// The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home screen.
// The home screen is FilePickerScreen, which is a StatefulWidget to manage the state of selected files.
// Inside FilePickerScreen, we define a variable _selectedFiles to hold the list of picked files.
// The pickFiles method is defined to open the file picker and update the state with the selected files.
// When the user presses the "Pick Files" button, the pickFiles method is called.
// If files are selected, their names are displayed in the UI; otherwise, a message indicates no files are selected.
