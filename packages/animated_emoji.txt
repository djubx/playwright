# Complete Example of Using Animated Emoji

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_emoji/animated_emoji.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animated Emoji Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Animated Emoji Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying an animated emoji
              AnimatedEmoji(
                emoji: 'üéâ', // Celebration emoji
                size: 100.0, // Size of the emoji
                duration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Animation duration
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between emojis
              AnimatedEmoji(
                emoji: '‚ù§Ô∏è', // Heart emoji
                size: 100.0, // Size of the emoji
                duration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Animation duration
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Animated Emoji Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Column widget.
// 5. Inside the Column, two AnimatedEmoji widgets are displayed:
//    - The first one shows a celebration emoji (üéâ) with a size of 100.0 and an animation duration of 2 seconds.
//    - The second one shows a heart emoji (‚ù§Ô∏è) with the same size and duration.
// 6. The emojis animate continuously, providing a lively user experience.
