# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Artistic Multilingual Keyboards Package

## Installation
To get started with the `artistic_multilingual_keyboards` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  artistic_multilingual_keyboards: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Ensure you have the necessary permissions for input methods:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add any required permissions or configurations specific to your app's needs.

## Using the Package
To use the `artistic_multilingual_keyboards` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:artistic_multilingual_keyboards/artistic_multilingual_keyboards.dart';
```

You can then create an instance of the keyboard and customize it according to your needs. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initialize and display the keyboard:

```dart
// Create an instance of the keyboard
final keyboard = ArtisticMultilingualKeyboard(
  languages: ['en', 'es', 'fr'], // Supported languages
  onKeyPress: (key) {
    // Handle key press events
    print('Key pressed: $key');
  },
);
```

This setup allows you to create a multilingual keyboard that responds to user input. You can further customize the keyboard's appearance and behavior based on your application's requirements.

# Complete Example of Using the Artistic Multilingual Keyboards Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:artistic_multilingual_keyboards/artistic_multilingual_keyboards.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Multilingual Keyboard Example',
      home: KeyboardDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class KeyboardDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _KeyboardDemoState createState() => _KeyboardDemoState();
}

class _KeyboardDemoState extends State<KeyboardDemo> {
  String _inputText = ''; // Variable to hold the input text

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Artistic Multilingual Keyboard'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Text field to display the input text
          TextField(
            onChanged: (text) {
              setState(() {
                _inputText = text; // Update the input text
              });
            },
            decoration: InputDecoration(
              hintText: 'Type here...',
            ),
          ),
          // Display the input text
          Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
            child: Text(
              'You typed: $_inputText',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
          ),
          // Create an instance of the keyboard
          Expanded(
            child: ArtisticMultilingualKeyboard(
              languages: ['en', 'es', 'fr'], // Supported languages
              onKeyPress: (key) {
                setState(() {
                  _inputText += key; // Append the pressed key to the input text
                });
              },
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets MyApp as the root widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and home set to KeyboardDemo.
// 3. KeyboardDemo is a stateful widget that maintains the input text state.
// 4. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Column layout.
// 5. A TextField allows users to type input, updating _inputText on change.
// 6. The input text is displayed below the TextField.
// 7. An instance of ArtisticMultilingualKeyboard is created, supporting multiple languages.
// 8. When a key is pressed on the keyboard, the onKeyPress callback updates _inputText.
// 9. The UI updates to reflect the current input text dynamically.
