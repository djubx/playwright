# Flutter Airpods Package Overview
=====================================

The `flutter_airpods` package is a Flutter plugin that allows developers to access and control Apple AirPods and other W1-enabled headphones from their Flutter app. This package provides a simple and easy-to-use API for detecting, connecting, and controlling AirPods.

### When to Use This Package

This package is useful when you want to:

*   Detect when AirPods are connected or disconnected from the device
*   Get the current battery level of the AirPods
*   Control the playback, such as play, pause, and skip tracks
*   Get the current playback state, such as playing, paused, or stopped

### Features

*   Detect AirPods connection and disconnection
*   Get the current battery level of the AirPods
*   Control playback, such as play, pause, and skip tracks
*   Get the current playback state

# Setting Up the Flutter Airpods Package
==========================================

To use the `flutter_airpods` package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Pubspec.yaml File

Add the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  flutter_airpods: ^0.0.1
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to get the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_airpods/flutter_airpods.dart';
```

### Step 3: Initialize the Package

Initialize the package by calling the `init` method:

```dart
await Airpods.init();
```

### Step 4: Detect AirPods Connection and Disconnection

Use the `onConnected` and `onDisconnected` callbacks to detect when AirPods are connected or disconnected:

```dart
Airpods.onConnected.listen((_) {
  print('AirPods connected');
});

Airpods.onDisconnected.listen((_) {
  print('AirPods disconnected');
});
```

### Step 5: Get the Current Battery Level

Use the `getBatteryLevel` method to get the current battery level of the AirPods:

```dart
final batteryLevel = await Airpods.getBatteryLevel();
print('Battery level: $batteryLevel');
```

### Step 6: Control Playback

Use the `play`, `pause`, and `skip` methods to control playback:

```dart
await Airpods.play();
await Airpods.pause();
await Airpods.skip();
```

### Step 7: Get the Current Playback State

Use the `getPlaybackState` method to get the current playback state:

```dart
final playbackState = await Airpods.getPlaybackState();
print('Playback state: $playbackState');
```

### Platform-Specific Details

*   On Android, the package uses the `Bluetooth` API to connect to the AirPods.
*   On iOS, the package uses the `AVAudioSession` API to connect to the AirPods.

### Required Configurations or Optimizations

*   On Android, you need to add the `BLUETOOTH` permission to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" />
```

*   On iOS, you need to add the `NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription` key to your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs access to Bluetooth to connect to AirPods</string>
```
