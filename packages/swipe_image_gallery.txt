# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Swipe Image Gallery

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `swipe_image_gallery` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  swipe_image_gallery: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:swipe_image_gallery/swipe_image_gallery.dart';
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add permissions for photo access in your `Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your photo library.</string>
```

## Step 4: Using the Package
You can now use the `SwipeImageGallery` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:swipe_image_gallery/swipe_image_gallery.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample image URLs
    final List<String> imageUrls = [
      'https://example.com/image1.jpg',
      'https://example.com/image2.jpg',
      'https://example.com/image3.jpg',
    ];

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Swipe Image Gallery')),
        body: SwipeImageGallery(
          images: imageUrls,
          // Optional: Customize the gallery
          backgroundColor: Colors.black,
          onImageTap: (index) {
            // Handle image tap
            print('Tapped on image $index');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic image gallery that allows users to swipe through a list of images. You can customize the appearance and behavior further as needed.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the `swipe_image_gallery` package into your Flutter application successfully.

# Complete Example of Swipe Image Gallery

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:swipe_image_gallery/swipe_image_gallery.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample image URLs for the gallery
    final List<String> imageUrls = [
      'https://example.com/image1.jpg',
      'https://example.com/image2.jpg',
      'https://example.com/image3.jpg',
    ];

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Swipe Image Gallery')),
        body: SwipeImageGallery(
          images: imageUrls,
          // Optional: Customize the gallery
          backgroundColor: Colors.black,
          onImageTap: (index) {
            // Handle image tap
            print('Tapped on image $index');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Swipe Image Gallery'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold includes the SwipeImageGallery widget, which takes a list of image URLs.
// 5. Users can swipe left or right to navigate through the images.
// 6. Tapping on an image triggers the onImageTap callback, which currently prints the index of the tapped image to the console.
// 7. The gallery has a black background for better visibility of the images.
