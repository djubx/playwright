# Tutorial: Setting Up the Instana Agent Flutter Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the Instana Agent Flutter package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the Instana Agent package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  instana_agent: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open the `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

3. Add the Instana SDK initialization in your `MainActivity.java` or `MainActivity.kt`:

```java
import com.instana.agent.Instana;

public class MainActivity extends FlutterActivity {
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        Instana.start(this, "YOUR_INSTANA_AGENT_KEY"); // Replace with your Instana agent key
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open the `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following keys to enable network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

3. Initialize the Instana SDK in your `AppDelegate.swift`:

```swift
import UIKit
import Flutter
import Instana

@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: FlutterAppDelegate {
    override func application(
        _ application: UIApplication,
        didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?
    ) -> Bool {
        Instana.start(withAgentKey: "YOUR_INSTANA_AGENT_KEY") // Replace with your Instana agent key
        GeneratedPluginRegistrant.register(with: self)
        return super.application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: launchOptions)
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Using the Instana Agent

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s how to track an error and a user interaction:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:instana_agent/instana_agent.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Instana Agent Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Simulate an error
              try {
                throw Exception("Simulated error");
              } catch (e) {
                Instana.reportError(e); // Report the error to Instana
              }
            },
            child: Text('Trigger Error'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, it simulates an error and reports it to the Instana dashboard.

By following these steps, you can successfully integrate the Instana Agent Flutter package into your application and start monitoring its performance and errors.

# Complete Example: Instana Agent in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:instana_agent/instana_agent.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Instana Agent Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Simulate an error
              try {
                throw Exception("Simulated error");
              } catch (e) {
                Instana.reportError(e); // Report the error to Instana
              }
            },
            child: Text('Trigger Error'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The MaterialApp widget is created, which sets up the app's structure.
// 3. A Scaffold widget is used to provide a basic visual layout with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 5. When the button is pressed, it triggers an error simulation by throwing an exception.
// 6. The error is caught in the catch block, and Instana's reportError method is called to send the error details to the Instana dashboard.
// 7. This allows developers to monitor and analyze errors in real-time, improving the application's reliability and user experience.
```
