# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Auto Scroll Text Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the `auto_scroll_text` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  auto_scroll_text: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:auto_scroll_text/auto_scroll_text.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the AutoScrollText Widget
You can now use the `AutoScrollText` widget in your application. Below is a simple example of how to implement it:

### Android and iOS Specific Configurations
For both Android and iOS, no additional configurations are required to use the `auto_scroll_text` package. However, ensure that your Flutter SDK is up to date to avoid compatibility issues.

### Example Usage
Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to use the `AutoScrollText` widget:

```dart
AutoScrollText(
  'This is an example of auto-scrolling text.',
  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, color: Colors.black),
  scrollDirection: Axis.horizontal,
  pauseDuration: Duration(seconds: 2),
  scrollSpeed: 50.0,
),
```

In this example:
- `scrollDirection` specifies the direction of the scroll.
- `pauseDuration` sets how long the text pauses before scrolling again.
- `scrollSpeed` controls the speed of the scrolling text.

With these steps, you can easily integrate the `auto_scroll_text` package into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using Auto Scroll Text

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:auto_scroll_text/auto_scroll_text.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Auto Scroll Text Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Auto Scroll Text Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Container(
            width: 300, // Set a fixed width for the scrolling text
            child: AutoScrollText(
              'Welcome to the Auto Scroll Text package demo! This text will scroll automatically.',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, color: Colors.blue),
              scrollDirection: Axis.horizontal, // Scroll horizontally
              pauseDuration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Pause for 2 seconds
              scrollSpeed: 50.0, // Set the speed of scrolling
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Auto Scroll Text Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers a Container that holds the AutoScrollText widget.
// 5. The AutoScrollText widget displays a welcome message that scrolls horizontally.
// 6. The text pauses for 2 seconds before resuming scrolling, and the speed of the scroll is set to 50.0.
// 7. The application provides a simple and effective demonstration of the auto scrolling feature.
