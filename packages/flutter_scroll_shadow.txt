# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Flutter Scroll Shadow

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_scroll_shadow` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_scroll_shadow: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_scroll_shadow).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable the use of Swift in your project. Open your `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode and ensure that the project settings are configured to support Swift.

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_scroll_shadow/flutter_scroll_shadow.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the `ScrollShadow` widget to wrap your scrollable widgets. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
ScrollShadow(
  shadowColor: Colors.black.withOpacity(0.5),
  shadowBlur: 10.0,
  child: ListView.builder(
    itemCount: 100,
    itemBuilder: (context, index) {
      return ListTile(
        title: Text('Item $index'),
      );
    },
  ),
);
```

This code snippet creates a list of 100 items with a shadow effect applied to the scrollable area.

# Complete Example of Flutter Scroll Shadow

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_scroll_shadow/flutter_scroll_shadow.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Scroll Shadow Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Scroll Shadow Example'),
        ),
        body: ScrollShadow(
          // Setting the shadow color and blur effect
          shadowColor: Colors.black.withOpacity(0.5), // Shadow color
          shadowBlur: 10.0, // Blur radius of the shadow
          child: ListView.builder(
            itemCount: 100, // Number of items in the list
            itemBuilder: (context, index) {
              return ListTile(
                title: Text('Item $index'), // Displaying item number
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body uses the ScrollShadow widget to wrap a ListView.builder.
// 5. The ScrollShadow widget applies a shadow effect to the ListView.
// 6. The ListView.builder creates a list of 100 items, each represented by a ListTile.
// 7. As the user scrolls through the list, the shadow effect enhances the visual experience.
```

In summary, the `flutter_scroll_shadow` package provides an easy way to add depth and visual interest to scrollable widgets in Flutter applications.
