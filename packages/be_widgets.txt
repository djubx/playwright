# Setting Up and Using the "be_widgets" Package

## Installation

To get started with the **be_widgets** package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  be_widgets: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/be_widgets).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package

Once the package is installed, you can start using its widgets in your Flutter application. Import the package at the top of your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:be_widgets/be_widgets.dart';
```

You can now use the various widgets provided by the package. For example, you can create a custom button using `BeButton`:

```dart
BeButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // Handle button press
  },
  child: Text('Click Me'),
);
```

This is just a simple example, but the package offers a wide range of widgets that can be customized to fit your needs.

# Complete Example of Using "be_widgets"

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:be_widgets/be_widgets.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Be Widgets Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Be Widgets Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Using BeButton from be_widgets package
            BeButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action when button is pressed
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Button Pressed!')),
                );
              },
              child: Text('Press Me'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between widgets
            // Using BeCard to display information
            BeCard(
              child: Padding(
                padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
                child: Text(
                  'This is a card from be_widgets!',
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to HomePage, which is the main screen.
// 4. HomePage contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the BeButton and BeCard vertically.
// 6. When the BeButton is pressed, a SnackBar is displayed to show feedback.
// 7. The BeCard widget displays a simple text message, showcasing the card feature from the package.
