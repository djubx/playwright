# Secretary Flutter Package: An Overview

The "secretary" Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to simplify the management of background tasks and scheduling in Flutter applications. It provides a robust framework for handling tasks that need to be executed periodically or at specific times, making it ideal for applications that require regular updates or background processing.

## When to Use the Secretary Package

The Secretary package is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to:
- Perform periodic data synchronization with a server.
- Schedule notifications or reminders at specific times.
- Execute background tasks without user intervention.
- Manage complex task scheduling with ease.

## Key Features

- **Task Scheduling**: Easily schedule tasks to run at specific intervals or times.
- **Background Execution**: Run tasks in the background, even when the app is not active.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Customizable**: Offers flexibility to define custom task execution logic.

# Setting Up and Using the Secretary Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up the Secretary package in a Flutter project and demonstrate how to use it effectively.

## Setup Process

### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the Secretary package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  secretary: ^1.0.0
```

### Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android

1. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED"/>
```

3. Ensure your `MainActivity` extends `FlutterActivity`.

#### iOS

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to support background execution:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
  <string>fetch</string>
  <string>processing</string>
</array>
```

### Step 3: Initialize the Package

Initialize the Secretary package in your `main.dart` file:

```dart
import 'package:secretary/secretary.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
  RealFlutter.initialize();
}
```

## Using the Secretary Package

To use the Secretary package, define tasks and schedule them using the `RealFlutter` class. Here's a simple example:

```dart
RealFlutter.scheduleTask(
  taskId: 'syncData',
  frequency: Duration(hours: 1),
  task: () async {
    // Your task logic here
    print('Data synchronized');
  },
);
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:secretary/secretary.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
  RealFlutter.initialize(); // Initialize the Secretary package
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Secretary Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _scheduleTasks(); // Schedule tasks when the app starts
  }

  void _scheduleTasks() {
    RealFlutter.scheduleTask(
      taskId: 'syncData',
      frequency: Duration(hours: 1),
      task: () async {
        // Task logic: Synchronize data every hour
        print('Data synchronized');
      },
    );

    RealFlutter.scheduleTask(
      taskId: 'sendNotification',
      frequency: Duration(days: 1),
      task: () async {
        // Task logic: Send a daily notification
        print('Notification sent');
      },
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Secretary Demo Home Page'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Tasks are scheduled in the background.',
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app initializes and runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a home page of MyHomePage.
// 3. MyHomePage is a stateful widget that schedules tasks in its initState method.
// 4. The _scheduleTasks method uses RealFlutter to schedule two tasks:
//    - 'syncData' task runs every hour to synchronize data.
//    - 'sendNotification' task runs daily to send a notification.
// 5. The app displays a simple message indicating that tasks are scheduled.
