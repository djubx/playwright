# Tutorial: Setting Up the Flutter Barcode Listener

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_barcode_listener` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_barcode_listener` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_barcode_listener: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_barcode_listener).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FLASHLIGHT"/>
```

3. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request camera access:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the camera to scan barcodes.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the microphone for scanning.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the barcode listener.

# Complete Example: RealFlutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_barcode_listener/flutter_barcode_listener.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Barcode Listener Example',
      home: BarcodeScannerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class BarcodeScannerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _BarcodeScannerScreenState createState() => _BarcodeScannerScreenState();
}

class _BarcodeScannerScreenState extends State<BarcodeScannerScreen> {
  String _barcode = "Scan a barcode";

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Barcode Listener'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              _barcode,
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // The BarcodeListener widget listens for barcode scans
            BarcodeListener(
              onBarcodeScanned: (String barcode) {
                // Update the state with the scanned barcode
                setState(() {
                  _barcode = barcode;
                });
              },
              child: Container(
                height: 300,
                width: 300,
                color: Colors.grey[300],
                child: Center(
                  child: Text(
                    'Point your camera here',
                    style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18),
                  ),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp and its title.
// 3. The home of the MaterialApp is set to BarcodeScannerScreen, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 4. In the BarcodeScannerScreen, we maintain a state variable _barcode to hold the scanned value.
// 5. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget containing a Column.
// 6. The Column displays the current barcode and a BarcodeListener widget.
// 7. The BarcodeListener listens for barcode scans and updates the _barcode state when a scan occurs.
// 8. The scanned barcode is displayed in the center of the screen, and the user is prompted to point the camera at a barcode.
