# Overview of the `system_info_plus` Flutter Package

The `system_info_plus` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers who need to access detailed system information across different platforms. This package provides a unified API to retrieve various system properties, such as operating system details, CPU architecture, and memory statistics, making it an essential tool for applications that require system diagnostics or need to adapt their behavior based on the device's capabilities.

## When to Use `system_info_plus`

- **Diagnostics and Monitoring**: Use this package to gather system information for diagnostic purposes or to monitor the performance of your application on different devices.
- **Adaptive UI/UX**: Adjust your application's user interface or features based on the device's capabilities, such as available memory or CPU architecture.
- **Debugging and Logging**: Collect system information to assist in debugging or to log device details for error reporting.

## Key Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on Android, iOS, and other platforms supported by Flutter.
- **Comprehensive System Information**: Access to a wide range of system properties, including OS version, CPU details, and memory statistics.

# Setting Up and Using `system_info_plus`

In this section, we'll walk through the setup process for the `system_info_plus` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Setup Process

1. **Add Dependency**: First, add the `system_info_plus` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     system_info_plus: ^1.0.0
   ```

2. **Install the Package**: Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: No additional configuration is required for Android.
   - **iOS**: Ensure that your `ios/Podfile` is using platform version 9.0 or higher. Add the following line if it's not already present:

     ```ruby
     platform :ios, '9.0'
     ```

## Using `system_info_plus`

To use the package, import it into your Dart file and access the system information through the `SystemInfo` class. Below is a simple example of how to retrieve and display system information.

```dart
import 'package:system_info_plus/system_info_plus.dart';

void printSystemInfo() {
  print('Operating System: ${SysInfo.operatingSystemName}');
  print('Kernel Architecture: ${SysInfo.kernelArchitecture}');
  print('Total Physical Memory: ${SysInfo.getTotalPhysicalMemory()} bytes');
}
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:system_info_plus/system_info_plus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'System Info Plus Demo',
      home: SystemInfoScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class SystemInfoScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SystemInfoScreenState createState() => _SystemInfoScreenState();
}

class _SystemInfoScreenState extends State<SystemInfoScreen> {
  String _systemInfo = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _fetchSystemInfo();
  }

  // Fetches system information and updates the state
  void _fetchSystemInfo() {
    setState(() {
      _systemInfo = '''
      Operating System: ${SysInfo.operatingSystemName}
      Kernel Architecture: ${SysInfo.kernelArchitecture}
      Total Physical Memory: ${SysInfo.getTotalPhysicalMemory()} bytes
      Free Physical Memory: ${SysInfo.getFreePhysicalMemory()} bytes
      Number of Processors: ${SysInfo.numberOfProcessors}
      ''';
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('System Info'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Text(
          _systemInfo,
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application starts by running the RealFlutter widget.
// RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp.
// The home of the MaterialApp is set to SystemInfoScreen, a StatefulWidget.
// SystemInfoScreen fetches system information in its initState method.
// The _fetchSystemInfo method retrieves various system properties using SysInfo.
// The system information is stored in the _systemInfo string and displayed in the UI.
// The UI consists of a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body that displays the system information.
