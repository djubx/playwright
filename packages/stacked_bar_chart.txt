  stacked_bar_chart: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `stacked_bar_chart` package, you can create a simple stacked bar chart by following these steps:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:
   ```dart
   import 'package:stacked_bar_chart/stacked_bar_chart.dart';
   ```

2. Create a data model for your chart:
   ```dart
   class ChartData {
     final String label;
     final List<double> values;

     ChartData(this.label, this.values);
   }
   ```

3. Use the `StackedBarChart` widget in your widget tree:
   ```dart
   StackedBarChart(
     data: [
       ChartData('Category 1', [10, 20, 30]),
       ChartData('Category 2', [20, 10, 40]),
     ],
     // Additional customization options can be added here
   );
   ```

With these steps, you can create a basic stacked bar chart in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using `stacked_bar_chart`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:stacked_bar_chart/stacked_bar_chart.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Stacked Bar Chart Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Stacked Bar Chart Example'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: StackedBarChart(
            data: [
              // Creating data for the chart
              ChartData('Category 1', [10, 20, 30]),
              ChartData('Category 2', [20, 10, 40]),
              ChartData('Category 3', [30, 40, 20]),
            ],
            // Customizing the appearance of the chart
            barColors: [
              Colors.red,
              Colors.blue,
              Colors.green,
            ],
            // Adding labels for the x-axis
            xAxisLabels: ['Q1', 'Q2', 'Q3'],
            // Adding a title to the chart
            title: 'Quarterly Sales Data',
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Explanation of the application flow:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The AppBar displays the title of the application.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Padding widget to add space around the StackedBarChart.
// 5. The StackedBarChart widget is created with sample data representing three categories over three quarters.
// 6. The barColors property customizes the colors of the bars in the chart.
// 7. The xAxisLabels property provides labels for the x-axis, and the title property sets the chart's title.
