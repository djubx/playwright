# Complete Example of flutter_awesome_alert_box

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_awesome_alert_box/flutter_awesome_alert_box.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Awesome Alert Box Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Alert Box Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Show a success alert when the button is pressed
              AwesomeAlertBox.show(
                context: context,
                title: 'Success',
                message: 'Your operation was successful!',
                alertType: AlertType.success,
              );
            },
            child: Text('Show Success Alert'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Alert Box Example'.
// 4. In the body of the Scaffold, a Center widget is used to center the content.
// 5. An ElevatedButton is created, which, when pressed, triggers the AwesomeAlertBox.show() method.
// 6. The show method displays a success alert with a title and message, providing feedback to the user.
// 7. The alert box is customizable, allowing for different alert types and content.
