# Flutter Package: flutter_sim_country_code

The `flutter_sim_country_code` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that allows you to easily retrieve the country code of the SIM card inserted in a mobile device. This can be particularly useful in applications that require localization, user preferences based on geographical location, or any feature that needs to identify the user's country.

## When to Use This Package

- **Localization**: Automatically set the app's language or content based on the user's country.
- **User Preferences**: Customize user experiences by providing country-specific options.
- **Analytics**: Track user demographics based on their SIM card country code.

## Features

- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup and usage within your Flutter application.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Automatically detects changes in the SIM card.

This package is ideal for developers looking to enhance their applications with location-based features without the need for complex configurations.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_sim_country_code

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_sim_country_code` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_sim_country_code: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

1. Open `AndroidManifest.xml` located in `android/app/src/main/`.
2. Add the following permissions to access the SIM card information:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_SMS"/>
```

### iOS

1. Open `Info.plist` located in `ios/Runner/`.
2. Add the following key to request permission to access the user's phone information:

```xml
<key>NSContactsUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your contacts to provide better services.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to retrieve the SIM country code.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_sim_country_code/flutter_sim_country_code.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('SIM Country Code Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: FutureBuilder<String?>(
            future: FlutterSimCountryCode.simCountryCode,
            builder: (context, snapshot) {
              if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                return CircularProgressIndicator();
              } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
                return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}');
              } else {
                return Text('SIM Country Code: ${snapshot.data}');
              }
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we use a `FutureBuilder` to asynchronously fetch the SIM country code and display it on the screen.

# Complete Example: Main File for flutter_sim_country_code

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_sim_country_code/flutter_sim_country_code.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('SIM Country Code Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: FutureBuilder<String?>(
            // Initiating the FutureBuilder to fetch the SIM country code
            future: FlutterSimCountryCode.simCountryCode,
            builder: (context, snapshot) {
              // Checking the connection state of the Future
              if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                // While waiting for the result, show a loading indicator
                return CircularProgressIndicator();
              } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
                // If there's an error, display it
                return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}');
              } else {
                // Once the data is retrieved, display the SIM country code
                return Text('SIM Country Code: ${snapshot.data}');
              }
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, a FutureBuilder is used to fetch the SIM country code.
// 4. The FutureBuilder checks the connection state:
//    - If it's waiting, a CircularProgressIndicator is shown.
//    - If there's an error, it displays the error message.
//    - Once the data is available, it shows the SIM country code on the screen.
