# Tutorial: Setting Up Storyly in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the Storyly Flutter package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the Storyly Flutter package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  storyly_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/storyly_flutter).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure that you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the required permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<manifest>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
    <application>
        ...
    </application>
</manifest>
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. Ensure your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Initialize Storyly
In your main Dart file, initialize Storyly with your unique Storyly ID. This ID can be obtained from the Storyly dashboard.

```dart
import 'package:storyly_flutter/storyly_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: StorylyView(
        storylyId: 'YOUR_STORYLY_ID',
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Customizing Storyly
You can customize the appearance and behavior of the Storyly view by using various properties available in the `StorylyView` widget. For example:

```dart
StorylyView(
  storylyId: 'YOUR_STORYLY_ID',
  onStoryClick: (story) {
    // Handle story click
  },
  onStoryEnd: () {
    // Handle story end
  },
)
```

With these steps, you should have a basic setup of the Storyly Flutter package in your application.

# Complete Example of Storyly in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:storyly_flutter/storyly_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Storyly Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Storyly Flutter Example'),
        ),
        body: StorylyView(
          storylyId: 'YOUR_STORYLY_ID', // Replace with your Storyly ID
          onStoryClick: (story) {
            // This callback is triggered when a story is clicked
            print('Story clicked: ${story.id}');
          },
          onStoryEnd: () {
            // This callback is triggered when the story ends
            print('Story ended');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Storyly Flutter Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold includes a StorylyView widget.
// 5. The StorylyView is initialized with a unique Storyly ID.
// 6. The onStoryClick callback is defined to handle clicks on stories, printing the clicked story's ID.
// 7. The onStoryEnd callback is defined to handle the end of a story, printing a message to the console.
// 8. When the app runs, users can view and interact with stories, enhancing their experience.
