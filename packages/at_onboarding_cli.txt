# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `at_onboarding_cli`

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `at_onboarding_cli` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `at_onboarding_cli` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  at_onboarding_cli: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/at_onboarding_cli).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the necessary permissions and configurations. For example:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<application>
    ...
    <meta-data
        android:name="com.google.android.gms.ads.APPLICATION_ID"
        android:value="YOUR_ADMOB_APP_ID"/>
</application>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the required permissions and configurations. For example:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the onboarding process using the `RealFlutter` class.

# Complete Example of Using `at_onboarding_cli`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:at_onboarding_cli/at_onboarding_cli.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Onboarding Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: OnboardingScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class OnboardingScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _OnboardingScreenState createState() => _OnboardingScreenState();
}

class _OnboardingScreenState extends State<OnboardingScreen> {
  // Initialize the AtOnboarding instance
  late AtOnboarding _atOnboarding;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Create an instance of AtOnboarding
    _atOnboarding = AtOnboarding();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Onboarding Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () async {
            // Start the onboarding process
            await _atOnboarding.startOnboarding();
            // Navigate to the home screen after onboarding
            Navigator.pushReplacement(
              context,
              MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => HomeScreen()),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Start Onboarding'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to the Home Screen!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The OnboardingScreen is displayed, which contains a button to start the onboarding process.
// 3. When the button is pressed, the onboarding process is initiated using the AtOnboarding instance.
// 4. After the onboarding is complete, the app navigates to the HomeScreen.
// 5. The HomeScreen displays a welcome message to the user.
```
