// This is the main entry point of the application.
// The `RealFlutter` class is a stateless widget that wraps the `PianoExample` widget.
// The `PianoExample` widget is a stateful widget that creates a piano keyboard with 4 octaves and note labels.
// The piano keyboard is displayed in the center of the screen.
// When a key is pressed, the piano keyboard produces sound.

// To improve performance, consider reducing the number of octaves or disabling note labels and octave indicators.
// For optimal audio output, ensure that your device's volume is turned up and not muted.

// This example demonstrates the basic usage of the `flutter_piano_pro` package.
// You can customize the piano keyboard layout, add more features, and integrate it with your own music-based app.
