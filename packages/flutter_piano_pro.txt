1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_piano_pro/flutter_piano_pro.dart';
```

2. Create a basic piano widget:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Piano Pro Example'),
      ),
      body: Piano(
        onNotePressed: (note) {
          // Handle note pressed
          print('Note pressed: $note');
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Run your application to see the piano interface in action.

This setup will give you a basic piano interface where you can press keys and see the corresponding notes printed in the console.

# Complete Example of Flutter Piano Pro

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_piano_pro/flutter_piano_pro.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Piano Pro',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Piano Pro Example'),
      ),
      body: Piano(
        onNotePressed: (note) {
          // This function is called when a piano key is pressed.
          // The 'note' parameter contains the note that was pressed.
          print('Note pressed: $note');
        },
        // You can customize the appearance of the piano here.
        pianoKeyColor: Colors.white,
        pianoKeyPressedColor: Colors.red,
        // Set the number of octaves to display.
        numberOfOctaves: 2,
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to RealFlutter, which is the main screen of the app.
// 4. RealFlutter builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Piano widget.
// 5. The Piano widget listens for key presses and calls the onNotePressed function, printing the note to the console.
// 6. The piano's appearance can be customized with colors and the number of octaves displayed.
