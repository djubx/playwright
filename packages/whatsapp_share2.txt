  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('WhatsApp Share Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Share text to WhatsApp
                  WhatsAppShare.share(
                    text: "Hello from RealFlutter!",
                  );
                },
                child: Text('Share Text'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Share an image to WhatsApp
                  WhatsAppShare.share(
                    text: "Check out this image!",
                    image: "https://example.com/image.png",
                  );
                },
                child: Text('Share Image'),
              ),

                    image: "https://example.com/image.png",

              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The MaterialApp widget is created, providing the app structure.
// 3. A Scaffold widget is used to create the basic visual layout, including an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body contains a Center widget that centers its child widgets.
// 5. A Column widget is used to arrange the buttons vertically.
// 6. Two ElevatedButton widgets are created:
//    - The first button shares a text message when pressed.
//    - The second button shares an image from a URL when pressed.
// 7. The WhatsAppShare.share method is called with the appropriate parameters to initiate sharing.
