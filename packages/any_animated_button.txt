# Complete Example of Any Animated Button

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:any_animated_button/any_animated_button.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Any Animated Button Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Any Animated Button Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: AnyAnimatedButton(
            onTap: () {
              // Action to perform on button tap
              print('Button Pressed!');
            },
            child: Text(
              'Press Me',
              style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
            ),
            // Customizing the button appearance
            buttonColor: Colors.blue,
            buttonHeight: 50.0,
            buttonWidth: 200.0,
            animationDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 300),
            // Adding animations for different states
            onHover: (isHovered) {
              // Change color on hover
              return isHovered ? Colors.lightBlue : Colors.blue;
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that centers its child.
// 4. The child of the Center widget is an AnyAnimatedButton.
// 5. The button has an onTap callback that prints a message when pressed.
// 6. The button's appearance is customized with a blue color, specific height, and width.
// 7. The button also has an animation duration set for smooth transitions.
// 8. The onHover property changes the button's color when hovered over, enhancing interactivity.
