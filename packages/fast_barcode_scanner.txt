# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Fast Barcode Scanner

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the **fast_barcode_scanner** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  fast_barcode_scanner: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/fast_barcode_scanner).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version
    }
}
```

2. Add camera permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FLASHLIGHT"/>
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request camera access:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to scan barcodes.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save scanned images.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that the package is set up, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement barcode scanning.

# Complete Example of Fast Barcode Scanner

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fast_barcode_scanner/fast_barcode_scanner.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Fast Barcode Scanner Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String barcodeResult = "Scan a barcode";

  // Function to start scanning
  Future<void> startScan() async {
    // Create an instance of the scanner
    final scanner = FastBarcodeScanner();

    // Start scanning and wait for the result
    String result = await scanner.scan();

    // Update the state with the scanned result
    setState(() {
      barcodeResult = result;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Fast Barcode Scanner'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              barcodeResult,
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: startScan, // Trigger the scan on button press
              child: Text('Start Scanning'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The home widget is set to RealFlutter, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 3. In the RealFlutter state, we define a string to hold the scanned barcode result.
// 4. The startScan function initializes the FastBarcodeScanner and waits for the user to scan a barcode.
// 5. Once a barcode is scanned, the result is stored in the barcodeResult variable, and the UI is updated.
// 6. The UI consists of a Text widget to display the scanned result and a button to initiate the scanning process.
```

// Final Summary:
// The application begins by displaying a button to start scanning. When the button is pressed, the `startScan` function is called, which invokes the barcode scanner. Upon successfully scanning a barcode, the result is displayed on the screen. This simple flow allows users to easily scan barcodes and view the results in real-time.
