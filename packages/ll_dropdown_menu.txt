```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the `ll_dropdown_menu` in your Flutter application:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ll_dropdown_menu/ll_dropdown_menu.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Dropdown Menu Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: DropdownMenuExample(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DropdownMenuExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DropdownMenuExampleState createState() => _DropdownMenuExampleState();
}

class _DropdownMenuExampleState extends State<DropdownMenuExample> {
  String? selectedValue;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return LlDropdownMenu<String>(
      items: ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3'],
      onChanged: (value) {
        setState(() {
          selectedValue = value;
        });
      },
      value: selectedValue,
      hint: 'Select an option',
    );
  }
}
```

### Platform-Specific Details

- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid compatibility issues.
  
  ```gradle
  android {
      ...
      defaultConfig {
          ...
          minSdkVersion 21
      }
  }
  ```

- **iOS**: For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

  ```ruby
  platform :ios, '10.0'
  ```

## Step 4: Customization

You can customize the dropdown menu by providing additional parameters such as `icon`, `style`, and `dropdownColor`. Refer to the package documentation for more customization options.

# Complete Example of ll_dropdown_menu

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ll_dropdown_menu/ll_dropdown_menu.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Dropdown Menu Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: DropdownMenuExample(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DropdownMenuExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DropdownMenuExampleState createState() => _DropdownMenuExampleState();
}

class _DropdownMenuExampleState extends State<DropdownMenuExample> {
  // Variable to hold the selected value from the dropdown
  String? selectedValue;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return LlDropdownMenu<String>(
      // List of items to display in the dropdown
      items: ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3'],
      // Callback function that gets called when an item is selected
      onChanged: (value) {
        setState(() {
          // Update the selected value
          selectedValue = value;
        });
      },
      // Currently selected value
      value: selectedValue,
      // Placeholder text when no option is selected
      hint: 'Select an option',
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which sets up the MaterialApp and Scaffold.
// 2. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a body that centers the DropdownMenuExample widget.
// 3. The DropdownMenuExample widget is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the selected value.
// 4. The LlDropdownMenu widget is used to create the dropdown menu, with a list of options provided.
// 5. When an option is selected, the onChanged callback updates the selectedValue state, which triggers a rebuild of the widget to reflect the selected option.
```
