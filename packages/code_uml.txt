# Exploring the `code_uml` Flutter Package

The `code_uml` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to visualize and generate UML diagrams directly from their code. This package is particularly useful for software architects, developers, and teams who want to maintain clear documentation and design patterns in their applications. By using `code_uml`, you can create class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and more, which can help in understanding the structure and flow of your application.

## When to Use `code_uml`
- **Documentation**: When you need to document your codebase visually.
- **Design Patterns**: To illustrate design patterns and architecture.
- **Code Review**: To facilitate discussions during code reviews by providing visual aids.
- **Learning**: For new developers to understand the relationships and structures within the code.

## Key Features
- **Class Diagrams**: Automatically generate class diagrams from your Dart code.
- **Sequence Diagrams**: Visualize the interactions between classes over time.
- **Customizable**: Options to customize the appearance of the diagrams.
- **Integration**: Easy integration with existing Flutter projects.

With these features, `code_uml` stands out as a valuable asset for any Flutter development team looking to enhance their code documentation and understanding.

# Setting Up and Using the `code_uml` Package

## Installation
To get started with the `code_uml` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  code_uml: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/code_uml).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `code_uml` package, you can start by importing it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:code_uml/code_uml.dart';
```

You can then create UML diagrams by defining your classes and using the provided methods to generate the diagrams.

### Example Usage
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a class diagram:

```dart
void main() {
  final diagram = ClassDiagram();
  diagram.addClass('User', ['String name', 'String email']);
  diagram.addClass('Post', ['String title', 'String content']);
  diagram.addRelationship('User', 'Post', 'creates');
  print(diagram.generate());
}
```

This code snippet creates a class diagram with two classes, `User` and `Post`, and establishes a relationship between them.

# Complete Example of Using `code_uml`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:code_uml/code_uml.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Code UML Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Code UML Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Create a new class diagram
              final diagram = ClassDiagram();
              
              // Add classes to the diagram
              diagram.addClass('User', ['String name', 'String email']);
              diagram.addClass('Post', ['String title', 'String content']);
              
              // Define a relationship between classes
              diagram.addRelationship('User', 'Post', 'creates');
              
              // Generate and print the UML diagram
              print(diagram.generate());
            },
            child: Text('Generate UML Diagram'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, a new ClassDiagram instance is created.
// 5. Two classes, 'User' and 'Post', are added to the diagram with their respective properties.
// 6. A relationship is established where a 'User' creates a 'Post'.
// 7. Finally, the UML diagram is generated and printed to the console.
```
