# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Responsive Layout Grid Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `responsive_layout_grid` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `responsive_layout_grid` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  responsive_layout_grid: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure your `ios/Podfile` has the platform version set to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to create a responsive grid layout.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:responsive_layout_grid/responsive_layout_grid.dart';
```

2. Use the `ResponsiveLayoutGrid` widget to create a responsive layout. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
ResponsiveLayoutGrid(
  children: [
    ResponsiveLayoutGridItem(
      child: Container(color: Colors.red, height: 100),
    ),
    ResponsiveLayoutGridItem(
      child: Container(color: Colors.green, height: 100),
    ),
    ResponsiveLayoutGridItem(
      child: Container(color: Colors.blue, height: 100),
    ),
  ],
)
```

This code will create a grid with three items that will adjust based on the screen size.

# Complete Example of Responsive Layout Grid

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:responsive_layout_grid/responsive_layout_grid.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Responsive Layout Grid Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Responsive Layout Grid'),
        ),
        body: ResponsiveLayoutGrid(
          // The ResponsiveLayoutGrid widget creates a responsive grid layout
          children: [
            ResponsiveLayoutGridItem(
              // Each item in the grid can be a widget
              child: Container(color: Colors.red, height: 100),
            ),
            ResponsiveLayoutGridItem(
              child: Container(color: Colors.green, height: 100),
            ),
            ResponsiveLayoutGridItem(
              child: Container(color: Colors.blue, height: 100),
            ),
            ResponsiveLayoutGridItem(
              child: Container(color: Colors.yellow, height: 100),
            ),
            ResponsiveLayoutGridItem(
              child: Container(color: Colors.orange, height: 100),
            ),
            ResponsiveLayoutGridItem(
              child: Container(color: Colors.purple, height: 100),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Responsive Layout Grid'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is a ResponsiveLayoutGrid widget, which holds multiple ResponsiveLayoutGridItem widgets.
// 5. Each ResponsiveLayoutGridItem contains a Container with a different color and a fixed height of 100.
// 6. The layout will automatically adjust based on the screen size, providing a responsive design.
```
