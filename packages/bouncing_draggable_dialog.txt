## Installation

To add the bouncing_draggable_dialog package to your Flutter project, follow these steps:

1. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file.
2. Add the package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:

   ```

3. Run `flutter pub get` in your terminal to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

## Basic Usage

To use the bouncing_draggable_dialog package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:bouncing_draggable_dialog/bouncing_draggable_dialog.dart';
```

You can then create a dialog by calling the `showBouncingDraggableDialog` function. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
showBouncingDraggableDialog(
  context: context,
  builder: (context) {
    return AlertDialog(
      title: Text('Hello!'),
      content: Text('This is a bouncing draggable dialog.'),
      actions: [
        TextButton(
          onPressed: () {
            Navigator.of(context).pop();
          },
          child: Text('Close'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  },
);
```

This code snippet will display a draggable dialog with a bouncing effect when shown.

# Complete Example of Bouncing Draggable Dialog

Below is a complete Flutter application demonstrating the use of the bouncing_draggable_dialog package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bouncing_draggable_dialog/bouncing_draggable_dialog.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Bouncing Draggable Dialog Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Bouncing Draggable Dialog'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Show the bouncing draggable dialog when the button is pressed
              showBouncingDraggableDialog(
                context: context,
                builder: (context) {
                  return AlertDialog(
                    title: Text('Hello!'),
                    content: Text('This is a bouncing draggable dialog.'),
                    actions: [
                      TextButton(
                        onPressed: () {
                          // Close the dialog when the button is pressed
                          Navigator.of(context).pop();
                        },
                        child: Text('Close'),
                      ),
                    ],
                  );
                },
              );
            },
            child: Text('Show Dialog'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, there's an AppBar with the title 'Bouncing Draggable Dialog'.
// 4. The body contains a Center widget with an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the showBouncingDraggableDialog function is called.
// 6. This function displays an AlertDialog with a title, content, and a Close button.
// 7. Pressing the Close button will dismiss the dialog and return to the main screen.
