# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Pretty Button

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the **pretty_button** package, you first need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  pretty_button: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using Pretty Button in Your App

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using the **pretty_button** widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pretty_button/pretty_button.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Pretty Button Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: PrettyButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Action to perform on button press
              print('Button Pressed!');
            },
            child: Text('Click Me'),
            color: Colors.blue,
            borderRadius: 8.0,
            elevation: 5.0,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that uses the **pretty_button** package to display a button in the center of the screen. The button has a blue background, rounded corners, and an elevation effect.

# Complete Example of Pretty Button

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pretty_button/pretty_button.dart';

// Main class of the application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Pretty Button Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Center widget to align the button in the middle of the screen
          child: PrettyButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Action to perform on button press
              print('Button Pressed!');
            },
            child: Text('Click Me'), // Text displayed on the button
            color: Colors.blue, // Background color of the button
            borderRadius: 8.0, // Rounded corners of the button
            elevation: 5.0, // Shadow effect for the button
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp().
// 2. The RealFlutter class is instantiated, which builds the MaterialApp widget.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold, which provides the basic structure of the app.
// 4. An AppBar is created with the title 'Pretty Button Example'.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 6. Inside the Center widget, a PrettyButton is created with various properties:
//    - onPressed: Defines the action to take when the button is pressed.
//    - child: Contains the text 'Click Me' displayed on the button.
//    - color: Sets the button's background color to blue.
//    - borderRadius: Rounds the corners of the button.
//    - elevation: Adds a shadow effect to the button.
// 7. When the button is pressed, 'Button Pressed!' is printed to the console.
