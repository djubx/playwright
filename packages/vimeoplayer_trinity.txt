# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using vimeoplayer_trinity

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `vimeoplayer_trinity` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  vimeoplayer_trinity: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following permissions to allow video playback:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:vimeoplayer_trinity/vimeoplayer_trinity.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Player

You can now use the `RealFlutter` class to create a video player widget. Here’s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
RealFlutter(
  videoId: 'your_video_id', // Replace with your Vimeo video ID
  autoPlay: true, // Set to true to start playing automatically
  controls: true, // Show playback controls
)
```

This setup will allow you to embed a Vimeo video in your Flutter application with minimal effort.

# Complete Example of Using vimeoplayer_trinity

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:vimeoplayer_trinity/vimeoplayer_trinity.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Vimeo Player Example',
      home: VideoPlayerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class VideoPlayerScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Vimeo Player Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: RealFlutter(
          videoId: 'your_video_id', // Replace with your Vimeo video ID
          autoPlay: true, // Automatically play the video
          controls: true, // Show playback controls
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The VideoPlayerScreen is displayed as the home screen.
// 4. In VideoPlayerScreen, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. The RealFlutter widget is used to embed the Vimeo video player.
// 6. The videoId is set to the desired Vimeo video, and autoPlay and controls are configured.
// 7. When the app runs, the video will automatically play with controls available for user interaction.
