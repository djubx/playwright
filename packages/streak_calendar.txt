# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Streak Calendar Package

## Installation
To get started with the **streak_calendar** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  streak_calendar: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package
Once the package is installed and configured, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the streak calendar.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

2. Create a StatefulWidget to manage the state of the calendar.

3. Use the `StreakCalendar` widget to display the calendar in your app.

# Complete Example of Streak Calendar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:streak_calendar/streak_calendar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Streak Calendar Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: StreakCalendarDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class StreakCalendarDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _StreakCalendarDemoState createState() => _StreakCalendarDemoState();
}

class _StreakCalendarDemoState extends State<StreakCalendarDemo> {
  // Initialize a streak counter
  int streakCount = 0;

  // This method simulates user activity
  void _incrementStreak() {
    setState(() {
      streakCount++; // Increment the streak count
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Streak Calendar Demo'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Display the streak count
          Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
            child: Text(
              'Current Streak: $streakCount days',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
          ),
          // Streak Calendar widget
          StreakCalendar(
            // Pass the current streak count
            streakCount: streakCount,
            // Callback for when a date is tapped
            onDateTapped: (date) {
              // Simulate user activity on the selected date
              _incrementStreak();
              // Show a snackbar to inform the user
              ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                SnackBar(content: Text('Activity logged for $date')),
              );
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home screen is StreakCalendarDemo, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 4. Inside StreakCalendarDemo, we maintain a streakCount variable to track the user's streak.
// 5. The _incrementStreak method updates the streak count when called.
// 6. The build method constructs the UI, displaying the current streak count and the StreakCalendar widget.
// 7. When a date is tapped on the calendar, the onDateTapped callback is triggered, calling _incrementStreak and showing a snackbar to confirm the activity.
// 8. The UI updates to reflect the new streak count, providing a seamless user experience.
