}

// Application flow:
// 1. The user opens the app and is presented with a calendar view.
// 2. The user can tap on a day to mark it as completed or missed.
// 3. The app updates the streak counter based on the user's progress.
// 4. The user can view their progress and streaks in the calendar view.
// 5. The app encourages the user to perform daily tasks or activities to maintain their streaks.

// Summary:
// The code flows by first creating a Material app with a RealFlutter widget as the home screen.
// The RealFlutter widget contains a StreakCalendar widget that displays a calendar view with a streak counter.
// The user can tap on a day to mark it as completed or missed, and the app updates the streak counter accordingly.
// The app encourages the user to perform daily tasks or activities to maintain their streaks.
