# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_sensitive_content

## Installation
To add the `flutter_sensitive_content` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_sensitive_content: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to handle sensitive data. You may need to add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to configure your app's `Info.plist` to handle sensitive data appropriately. Ensure you have the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Using the Package
To use the `flutter_sensitive_content` package, you can wrap your sensitive content with the provided widget. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_sensitive_content/flutter_sensitive_content.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Sensitive Content Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: SensitiveContent(
            content: Text('This is sensitive information.'),
            onReveal: () {
              // Logic to reveal sensitive content
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to wrap sensitive content in the `SensitiveContent` widget, which manages the visibility of the content based on user actions.

# Complete Example of flutter_sensitive_content

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_sensitive_content/flutter_sensitive_content.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Sensitive Content Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: SensitiveContent(
            content: Text('This is sensitive information.'),
            onReveal: () {
              // Logic to reveal sensitive content
              // This could be a callback to show the content
              print('Sensitive content revealed!');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, we use the SensitiveContent widget.
// 5. The SensitiveContent widget takes a Text widget as its content.
// 6. The onReveal callback is triggered when the user interacts with the sensitive content.
// 7. In this example, it simply prints a message to the console when the content is revealed.

In summary, the `flutter_sensitive_content` package provides a straightforward way to manage sensitive information in Flutter applications.
