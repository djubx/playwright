# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Direct Caller Sim Choice Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `direct_caller_sim_choice` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  direct_caller_sim_choice: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `AndroidManifest.xml` located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions to allow the app to make calls:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CALL_PHONE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `Info.plist` located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request permission for making calls:

```xml
<key>NSContactsUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to contacts to make calls.</string>
<key>NSPhoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to make phone calls.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the SIM selection feature.

# Complete Example of Using Direct Caller Sim Choice

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:direct_caller_sim_choice/direct_caller_sim_choice.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Direct Caller SIM Choice',
      home: SimChoiceScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class SimChoiceScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SimChoiceScreenState createState() => _SimChoiceScreenState();
}

class _SimChoiceScreenState extends State<SimChoiceScreen> {
  List<SimCard> _simCards = []; // List to hold available SIM cards
  String _selectedSim; // Variable to hold the selected SIM card

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _loadSimCards(); // Load available SIM cards on initialization
  }

  // Function to load available SIM cards
  Future<void> _loadSimCards() async {
    try {
      _simCards = await DirectCallerSimChoice.getSimCards(); // Fetch SIM cards
      setState(() {}); // Update the UI
    } catch (e) {
      print("Error loading SIM cards: $e"); // Handle errors
    }
  }

  // Function to make a call using the selected SIM card
  void _makeCall(String phoneNumber) {
    if (_selectedSim != null) {
      DirectCallerSimChoice.makeCall(phoneNumber, _selectedSim); // Make the call
    } else {
      print("Please select a SIM card first."); // Prompt user to select a SIM
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Select SIM Card'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Dropdown to select SIM card
          DropdownButton<String>(
            hint: Text('Select SIM Card'),
            value: _selectedSim,
            onChanged: (String newValue) {
              setState(() {
                _selectedSim = newValue; // Update selected SIM
              });
            },
            items: _simCards.map<DropdownMenuItem<String>>((SimCard sim) {
              return DropdownMenuItem<String>(
                value: sim.simSlot,
                child: Text(sim.displayName), // Display SIM card name
              );
            }).toList(),
          ),
          // Button to make a call
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () => _makeCall('1234567890'), // Example phone number
            child: Text('Make Call'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (SimChoiceScreen).
// 3. SimChoiceScreen initializes by loading available SIM cards using _loadSimCards().
// 4. The user can select a SIM card from a dropdown menu populated with available SIMs.
// 5. When the user presses the "Make Call" button, the app checks if a SIM is selected.
// 6. If a SIM is selected, it initiates a call to the specified phone number using the selected SIM.
// 7. If no SIM is selected, it prompts the user to select one.
```
