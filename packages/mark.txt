# Setting Up and Using the "mark" Package

## Installation

To get started with the "mark" package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  mark: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/mark).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file, depending on your app's requirements. However, the "mark" package does not require any specific configurations beyond the standard Flutter setup.

## Basic Usage

To use the "mark" package, you can create a simple text editor widget. Below is a basic example of how to implement it in your Flutter application:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mark/mark.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Mark Package Example')),
        body: MarkEditor(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a `MarkEditor` widget that will allow users to input and format text.

# Complete Example of Using the "mark" Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mark/mark.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Mark Package Example')),
        body: MarkEditor(), // This is where the rich text editor is implemented
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MarkEditor extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MarkEditorState createState() => _MarkEditorState();
}

class _MarkEditorState extends State<MarkEditor> {
  // Create a controller for the Mark editor
  final MarkController _controller = MarkController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        // Toolbar for text formatting options
        MarkToolbar(controller: _controller),
        Expanded(
          child: MarkTextField(
            controller: _controller, // Connect the controller to the text field
            decoration: InputDecoration(
              border: OutlineInputBorder(),
              hintText: 'Type your text here...',
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// The RealFlutter app initializes the MarkEditor widget.
// The MarkEditor widget contains a MarkToolbar for formatting options
// and a MarkTextField for user input. The MarkController manages
// the state of the text and its formatting. Users can type text,
// select formatting options from the toolbar, and see the changes
// reflected in real-time in the text field.

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

```

### Summary of Application Flow
// The `RealFlutter` class serves as the main entry point of the application, 
// initializing the MaterialApp and setting up the home screen with an AppBar.
// The `MarkEditor` widget is a stateful widget that contains a toolbar and a text field.
// The `MarkToolbar` allows users to apply formatting to the text, while the 
// `MarkTextField` displays the text input area. The `MarkController` is used 
// to manage the text and its formatting state, ensuring that any changes made 
// through the toolbar are reflected in the text field in real-time. 
// This setup provides a simple yet effective rich text editing experience for users.
