# Overview of the `video_player_web_hls` Flutter Package

The `video_player_web_hls` package is a powerful extension for Flutter developers looking to integrate HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) video playback capabilities into their web applications. This package builds upon the existing `video_player` package, providing seamless support for HLS streams, which are commonly used for live broadcasts and adaptive bitrate streaming.

## When to Use

This package is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to:
- Stream live video content over the web.
- Provide adaptive streaming to accommodate varying network conditions.
- Integrate video playback in a Flutter web application with minimal setup.

## Features

- **HLS Support**: Enables playback of HLS streams directly in Flutter web applications.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: While primarily for web, it integrates smoothly with existing video player setups for mobile.
- **Customizable Controls**: Offers flexibility to design custom video controls.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Efficiently handles video buffering and playback for a smooth user experience.

# Setting Up the `video_player_web_hls` Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up and using the `video_player_web_hls` package in a Flutter project. We will cover platform-specific configurations for both Android and iOS, although the primary focus is on web integration.

## Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

First, add the `video_player_web_hls` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  video_player: ^2.2.11
  video_player_web_hls: ^0.1.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Configure for Web

The `video_player_web_hls` package is designed to work out of the box for web applications. Ensure your Flutter project is set up for web development by running:

```bash
flutter config --enable-web
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` includes internet permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your `Info.plist` allows arbitrary loads if you are testing with non-secure HTTP streams (not recommended for production):

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
  <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
  <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Implementing the Video Player

Now, let's implement a basic video player using the `RealFlutter` class as our main widget.

<-- START_MAIN -->

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:video_player/video_player.dart';
import 'package:video_player_web_hls/video_player_web_hls.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'HLS Video Player',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: VideoPlayerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class VideoPlayerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _VideoPlayerScreenState createState() => _VideoPlayerScreenState();
}

class _VideoPlayerScreenState extends State<VideoPlayerScreen> {
  late VideoPlayerController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the video player controller with an HLS stream URL
    _controller = VideoPlayerController.network(
      'https://test-streams.mux.dev/x36xhzz/x36xhzz.m3u8',
      videoPlayerOptions: VideoPlayerOptions(mixWithOthers: true),
    );

    // Load the video and set the state when ready
    _controller.initialize().then((_) {
      setState(() {});
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the controller to free up resources
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('HLS Video Player'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: _controller.value.isInitialized
            ? AspectRatio(
                aspectRatio: _controller.value.aspectRatio,
                child: VideoPlayer(_controller),
              )
            : CircularProgressIndicator(),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          // Toggle play/pause on button press
          setState(() {
            _controller.value.isPlaying
                ? _controller.pause()
                : _controller.play();
          });
        },
        child: Icon(
          _controller.value.isPlaying ? Icons.pause : Icons.play_arrow,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow:
// 1. The `RealFlutter` class initializes the app and sets the home screen to `VideoPlayerScreen`.
// 2. `VideoPlayerScreen` is a stateful widget that manages the video player state.
// 3. In `initState`, the video player controller is initialized with an HLS stream URL.
// 4. The video is loaded asynchronously, and the UI is updated once the video is ready.
// 5. The `build` method checks if the video is initialized and displays it using `VideoPlayer`.
// 6. A floating action button toggles between play and pause states.
// 7. The controller is disposed of in `dispose` to clean up resources.
