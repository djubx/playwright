# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the From_To_Time_Picker Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `from_to_time_picker` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  from_to_time_picker: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:from_to_time_picker/from_to_time_picker.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage
You can use the `FromToTimePicker` widget in your Flutter application as follows:

```dart
FromToTimePicker(
  startTime: TimeOfDay.now(),
  endTime: TimeOfDay.now().replacing(hour: TimeOfDay.now().hour + 1),
  onChanged: (start, end) {
    // Handle the time selection
    print('Start: ${start.format(context)}, End: ${end.format(context)}');
  },
)
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` to allow for proper permissions if your app requires background processing or notifications related to time management.

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>fetch</string>
    <string>remote-notification</string>
</array>
```

## Step 4: Customization
You can customize the appearance of the time picker by using various properties such as `backgroundColor`, `textColor`, and `buttonColor` to match your app's theme.

```dart
FromToTimePicker(
  startTime: TimeOfDay.now(),
  endTime: TimeOfDay.now().replacing(hour: TimeOfDay.now().hour + 1),
  backgroundColor: Colors.white,
  textColor: Colors.black,
  buttonColor: Colors.blue,
  onChanged: (start, end) {
    // Handle the time selection
  },
)
```

With these steps, you can easily integrate the `from_to_time_picker` package into your Flutter application and customize it to fit your needs.

# Complete Example of Using From_To_Time_Picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:from_to_time_picker/from_to_time_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'From To Time Picker Example',
      home: TimePickerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class TimePickerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _TimePickerScreenState createState() => _TimePickerScreenState();
}

class _TimePickerScreenState extends State<TimePickerScreen> {
  TimeOfDay? startTime; // Variable to hold the start time
  TimeOfDay? endTime;   // Variable to hold the end time

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('From To Time Picker'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the selected start and end times
            Text(
              'Start Time: ${startTime?.format(context) ?? 'Not selected'}',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            Text(
              'End Time: ${endTime?.format(context) ?? 'Not selected'}',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Time picker widget
            FromToTimePicker(
              startTime: startTime ?? TimeOfDay.now(),
              endTime: endTime ?? TimeOfDay.now().replacing(hour: TimeOfDay.now().hour + 1),
              onChanged: (start, end) {
                setState(() {
                  startTime = start; // Update the start time
                  endTime = end;     // Update the end time
                });
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (TimePickerScreen).
// 3. TimePickerScreen is a stateful widget that maintains the selected start and end times.
// 4. The build method displays the selected times and the FromToTimePicker widget.
// 5. When the user selects a time range, the onChanged callback updates the startTime and endTime variables.
// 6. The UI is updated to reflect the selected times using setState, ensuring a responsive experience.
