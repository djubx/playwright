# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the isoweek Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `isoweek` package, you first need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  isoweek: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the `isoweek` package to start using its features:

```dart
import 'package:isoweek/isoweek.dart';
```

## Step 4: Basic Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the `isoweek` package to get the ISO week number for a specific date:

```dart
void main() {
  DateTime date = DateTime.now(); // Get the current date
  int weekNumber = IsoWeek.weekOfYear(date); // Get the ISO week number
  print('ISO Week Number: $weekNumber');
}
```

This code snippet retrieves the current date and calculates the corresponding ISO week number.

With these steps, you are now ready to utilize the `isoweek` package in your Flutter applications!

# Complete Example of Using the isoweek Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:isoweek/isoweek.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Start the Flutter application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'ISO Week Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('ISO Week Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: WeekInfoWidget(), // Display week information
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class WeekInfoWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    DateTime today = DateTime.now(); // Get today's date
    int weekNumber = IsoWeek.weekOfYear(today); // Calculate ISO week number
    DateTime startOfWeek = IsoWeek.firstDateOfWeek(today); // Get start date of the week
    DateTime endOfWeek = IsoWeek.lastDateOfWeek(today); // Get end date of the week

    // Display the week information
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Text('Today: ${today.toLocal()}'),
        Text('ISO Week Number: $weekNumber'),
        Text('Start of Week: ${startOfWeek.toLocal()}'),
        Text('End of Week: ${endOfWeek.toLocal()}'),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a centered WeekInfoWidget.
// 3. The WeekInfoWidget retrieves the current date and calculates the ISO week number, start date, and end date of the week.
// 4. It then displays this information in a column format, showing the user the current date, ISO week number, and the start and end dates of the week.
```
