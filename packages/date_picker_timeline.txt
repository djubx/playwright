# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Date Picker Timeline

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the `date_picker_timeline` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  date_picker_timeline: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package
In your Dart file where you want to use the date picker, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:date_picker_timeline/date_picker_timeline.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Date Picker Timeline
You can now use the `DatePickerTimeline` widget in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
DatePickerTimeline(
  DateTime.now(), // Initial date
  onChange: (date) {
    // Handle date change
    print(date);
  },
  // Customize the appearance
  monthTextStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.grey),
  dayTextStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.black),
  selectedColor: Colors.blue,
  unselectedColor: Colors.grey[300],
);
```

This widget will display a timeline of dates starting from the current date, and you can customize the text styles and colors as needed.

# Complete Example of Date Picker Timeline

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:date_picker_timeline/date_picker_timeline.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Date Picker Timeline Example',
      home: DatePickerExample(),
    );
  }
}

class DatePickerExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DatePickerExampleState createState() => _DatePickerExampleState();
}

class _DatePickerExampleState extends State<DatePickerExample> {
  DateTime selectedDate = DateTime.now(); // Variable to hold the selected date

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Date Picker Timeline'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // DatePickerTimeline widget
          DatePickerTimeline(
            DateTime.now(), // Start from today's date
            onChange: (date) {
              setState(() {
                selectedDate = date; // Update the selected date
              });
            },
            monthTextStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.grey),
            dayTextStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.black),
            selectedColor: Colors.blue,
            unselectedColor: Colors.grey[300],
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20),
          // Display the selected date
          Text(
            'Selected Date: ${selectedDate.toLocal()}'.split(' ')[0], // Format the date
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
// The above code creates a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the date_picker_timeline package.
// 
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets RealFlutter as the root widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter class builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget.
// 3. The DatePickerExample class is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the selected date.
// 4. In the build method, a DatePickerTimeline widget is created, starting from the current date.
// 5. The onChange callback updates the selectedDate variable whenever a new date is selected.
// 6. The selected date is displayed below the date picker in a Text widget, formatted to show only the date part.
// 
// This application allows users to select a date from a timeline and see their selection in real-time.
