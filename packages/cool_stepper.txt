# Cool Stepper Flutter Package

The **cool_stepper** package is a powerful and flexible Flutter package designed to create stepper widgets with ease. It allows developers to build multi-step forms or processes in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where user input is required in a sequential manner, such as onboarding processes, checkout flows, or any multi-step forms.

## Features
- **Customizable Steps**: Easily customize each step with different content and styles.
- **Navigation Control**: Provides methods to navigate between steps programmatically.
- **Validation Support**: Integrates validation for each step, ensuring that users complete necessary fields before proceeding.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes, making it suitable for both mobile and web applications.

## When to Use
You should consider using the **cool_stepper** package when:
- You need to guide users through a multi-step process.
- You want to enhance user experience with a visually appealing stepper.
- You require validation at each step to ensure data integrity.

The package is ideal for applications like:
- User registration forms
- Checkout processes in e-commerce apps
- Surveys or feedback forms

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Cool Stepper Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the **cool_stepper** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cool_stepper: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your `ios/Podfile` has the platform set to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage
Now that you have the package installed, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the **cool_stepper** in your app.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:cool_stepper/cool_stepper.dart';
```

2. Create a StatefulWidget to manage the stepper state:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  int currentStep = 0;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Cool Stepper Example')),
      body: CoolStepper(
        currentStep: currentStep,
        onStepContinue: () {
          if (currentStep < 2) {
            setState(() {
              currentStep++;
            });
          } else {
            // Handle completion
          }
        },
        onStepCancel: () {
          if (currentStep > 0) {
            setState(() {
              currentStep--;
            });
          }
        },
        steps: [
          CoolStep(
            title: 'Step 1',
            content: Column(
              children: [
                Text('This is the first step.'),
                // Add your input fields here
              ],
            ),
          ),
          CoolStep(
            title: 'Step 2',
            content: Column(
              children: [
                Text('This is the second step.'),
                // Add your input fields here
              ],
            ),
          ),
          CoolStep(
            title: 'Step 3',
            content: Column(
              children: [
                Text('This is the final step.'),
                // Add your input fields here
              ],
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Running the Application
Run your application using `flutter run`. You should see a stepper that allows you to navigate through the steps.

# Complete Example of the Cool Stepper Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cool_stepper/cool_stepper.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Cool Stepper Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to track the current step
  int currentStep = 0;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Cool Stepper Example')),
      body: CoolStepper(
        currentStep: currentStep, // Current step index
        onStepContinue: () {
          // Logic to handle the continue button
          if (currentStep < 2) {
            setState(() {
              currentStep++; // Move to the next step
            });
          } else {
            // Handle completion of the stepper
            print('Completed all steps!');
          }
        },
        onStepCancel: () {
          // Logic to handle the cancel button
          if (currentStep > 0) {
            setState(() {
              currentStep--; // Move to the previous step
            });
          }
        },
        steps: [
          CoolStep(
            title: 'Step 1', // Title of the step
            content: Column(
              children: [
                Text('This is the first step.'),
                // Here you can add input fields for user data
              ],
            ),
          ),
          CoolStep(
            title: 'Step 2', // Title of the step
            content: Column(
              children: [
                Text('This is the second step.'),
                // Here you can add input fields for user data
              ],
            ),
          ),
          CoolStep(
            title: 'Step 3', // Title of the step
            content: Column(
              children: [
                Text('This is the final step.'),
                // Here you can add input fields for user data
              ],
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home as RealFlutter.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains the current step index.
// 4. The CoolStepper widget is used to create the stepper interface.
// 5. The onStepContinue method increments the current step index when the continue button is pressed.
// 6. The onStepCancel method decrements the current step index when the cancel button is pressed.
// 7. Each CoolStep contains a title and content, where you can add input fields for user data.
// 8. The app allows users to navigate through the steps, providing a guided experience.
