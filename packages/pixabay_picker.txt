# Setting Up and Using `pixabay_picker`

## Installation

To use the `pixabay_picker` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  pixabay_picker: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/pixabay_picker).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configuration:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    compileSdkVersion 31 // or latest
    ...
}
```

2. Ensure you have internet permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

This allows your app to make network requests to the Pixabay API.

## Using the Package

To use the `pixabay_picker`, you can create a simple interface that allows users to search and select images. Below is a basic example of how to implement it in your Flutter app.

# Complete Example of Using `pixabay_picker`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pixabay_picker/pixabay_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Pixabay Picker Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: ImagePickerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ImagePickerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ImagePickerScreenState createState() => _ImagePickerScreenState();
}

class _ImagePickerScreenState extends State<ImagePickerScreen> {
  String? _selectedImageUrl; // Variable to hold the selected image URL

  // Function to open the Pixabay image picker
  void _pickImage() async {
    final result = await PixabayPicker.pickImage(
      context: context,
      apiKey: 'YOUR_PIXABAY_API_KEY', // Replace with your Pixabay API key
    );

    // Check if an image was selected
    if (result != null) {
      setState(() {
        _selectedImageUrl = result; // Update the state with the selected image URL
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Pixabay Image Picker'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the selected image if available
            if (_selectedImageUrl != null)
              Image.network(
                _selectedImageUrl!,
                height: 200,
                width: 200,
                fit: BoxFit.cover,
              ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _pickImage, // Call the image picker function
              child: Text('Pick an Image from Pixabay'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application that utilizes the `pixabay_picker` package.
// 
// 1. The `main` function initializes the app and sets `RealFlutter` as the home widget.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` class builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The `ImagePickerScreen` stateful widget manages the image selection process.
// 4. The `_selectedImageUrl` variable holds the URL of the selected image.
// 5. The `_pickImage` function opens the Pixabay image picker and updates the state with the selected image URL.
// 6. The UI consists of an AppBar, an Image widget to display the selected image, and a button to trigger the image picker.
// 7. When the button is pressed, the `_pickImage` function is called, allowing users to select an image from Pixabay.
// 8. If an image is selected, it is displayed in the center of the screen.
