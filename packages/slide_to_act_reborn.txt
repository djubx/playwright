# Complete Example of Slide to Act Reborn

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:slide_to_act_reborn/slide_to_act_reborn.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Slide to Act Reborn Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Slide to Act Reborn'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
            child: SlideAction(
              // The action that will be triggered when the button is slid
              onSubmit: () {
                // Show a snackbar when the action is confirmed
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Action Confirmed!')),
                );
              },
              // Customize the appearance of the sliding button
              child: Container(
                height: 60,
                decoration: BoxDecoration(
                  color: Colors.blue,
                  borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(30),
                ),
                child: Center(
                  child: Text(
                    'Slide to Confirm',
                    style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
                  ),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'Slide to Act Reborn'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 5. A Padding widget is used to add space around the SlideAction widget.
// 6. The SlideAction widget is configured with an onSubmit callback that shows a Snackbar when the button is slid.
// 7. The child of the SlideAction is a Container styled to look like a button with rounded corners and a blue background.
// 8. When the user slides the button, the onSubmit callback is triggered, confirming the action.
