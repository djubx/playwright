# Visibility Aware State Flutter Package

The **visibility_aware_state** Flutter package is designed to help developers manage the visibility of widgets in their applications. This package provides a way to track whether a widget is visible on the screen, allowing for optimized rendering and state management based on visibility. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where performance is critical, such as in lists or complex UIs where certain elements may not always be in view.

## When to Use This Package

- **Lazy Loading**: When you want to load data or images only when they are visible to the user.
- **Performance Optimization**: To avoid unnecessary rendering of widgets that are not currently visible.
- **State Management**: To manage the state of widgets based on their visibility, such as pausing animations or stopping video playback when a widget is not in view.

## Features

- **Visibility Tracking**: Automatically tracks the visibility of widgets.
- **State Management**: Integrates with Flutter's state management solutions to update the UI based on visibility.
- **Performance Improvements**: Reduces the overhead of rendering widgets that are not visible.

This package is particularly useful in applications with complex UIs or when dealing with large lists of items, where managing the visibility of each item can lead to significant performance improvements.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Visibility Aware State

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the **visibility_aware_state** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  visibility_aware_state: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:visibility_aware_state/visibility_aware_state.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the `VisibilityAwareState` widget to wrap any widget you want to track. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
VisibilityAwareState(
  onVisibilityChanged: (isVisible) {
    if (isVisible) {
      print("Widget is visible");
    } else {
      print("Widget is not visible");
    }
  },
  child: YourWidget(),
);
```

This will print messages to the console whenever the visibility of `YourWidget` changes.

# Complete Example of Visibility Aware State

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:visibility_aware_state/visibility_aware_state.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Visibility Aware State Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Visibility Aware State Demo'),
        ),
        body: ListView.builder(
          itemCount: 100, // Number of items in the list
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            return VisibilityAwareState(
              onVisibilityChanged: (isVisible) {
                // This callback is triggered when the visibility changes
                if (isVisible) {
                  print("Item $index is visible");
                } else {
                  print("Item $index is not visible");
                }
              },
              child: Container(
                height: 100, // Height of each item
                color: index.isEven ? Colors.blue : Colors.green,
                alignment: Alignment.center,
                child: Text(
                  'Item $index',
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
                ),
              ),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a ListView.
// 3. The ListView.builder creates a list of 100 items.
// 4. Each item is wrapped in a VisibilityAwareState widget, which tracks its visibility.
// 5. When an item's visibility changes, the onVisibilityChanged callback is triggered, printing the visibility status to the console.
// 6. The items alternate colors (blue and green) for better visibility in the list.
