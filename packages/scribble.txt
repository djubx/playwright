Here's a detailed technical blog on the "scribble" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Scribble Flutter Package

The **Scribble** package for Flutter is a powerful tool that allows developers to create drawing applications with ease. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to draw, sketch, and annotate on the screen. This package is particularly useful for applications that require user-generated content, such as note-taking apps, educational tools, or creative drawing applications.

## When to Use Scribble

You might consider using the Scribble package in scenarios such as:
- **Educational Apps**: Where students can draw diagrams or annotate notes.
- **Artistic Applications**: For users to create sketches or digital art.
- **Annotation Tools**: Allowing users to mark up documents or images.
- **Games**: Where drawing mechanics are part of the gameplay.

## Features

- **Customizable Brush Styles**: Users can select different brush sizes and colors.
- **Eraser Functionality**: Users can easily erase parts of their drawings.
- **Undo/Redo Support**: Users can revert or reapply their actions.
- **Save and Share**: Users can save their drawings to the device or share them.

The Scribble package is designed to be flexible and easy to integrate into any Flutter application, making it a great choice for developers looking to add drawing capabilities.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Scribble Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the Scribble package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  scribble: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you plan to save images to the gallery. Add the following keys:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save drawings.</string>
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the Scribble package:

```dart
import 'package:scribble/scribble.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Scribble Widget

You can now use the Scribble widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
Scribble(
  onDraw: (points) {
    // Handle the drawn points
  },
  brushColor: Colors.blue,
  brushSize: 5.0,
)
```

This widget allows you to customize the brush color and size, and it provides a callback to handle the drawn points.

## Step 5: Additional Features

You can also implement features like undo/redo and saving drawings. Refer to the package documentation for more details on these functionalities.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and start using the Scribble package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using the Scribble Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:scribble/scribble.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Scribble Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: ScribblePage(),
    );
  }
}

class ScribblePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ScribblePageState createState() => _ScribblePageState();
}

class _ScribblePageState extends State<ScribblePage> {
  // Initialize a list to hold the drawn points
  List<Offset?> points = [];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Scribble Example'),
        actions: [
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.save),
            onPressed: () {
              // Save the drawing logic will go here
            },
          ),
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.undo),
            onPressed: () {
              // Undo the last action
              if (points.isNotEmpty) {
                points.removeLast();
                setState(() {});
              }
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
      body: GestureDetector(
        onPanUpdate: (details) {
          // Capture the points as the user draws
          setState(() {
            RenderBox renderBox = context.findRenderObject() as RenderBox;
            points.add(renderBox.globalToLocal(details.globalPosition));
          });
        },
        onPanEnd: (details) {
          // When the user lifts their finger, add a null point to signify the end of a stroke
          points.add(null);
        },
        child: CustomPaint(
          painter: ScribblePainter(points),
          child: Container(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Custom painter to draw the points on the canvas
class ScribblePainter extends CustomPainter {
  final List<Offset?> points;

  ScribblePainter(this.points);

  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    // Set the paint style
    Paint paint = Paint()
      ..color = Colors.blue
      ..strokeCap = StrokeCap.round
      ..strokeWidth = 5.0;

    // Draw the points on the canvas
    for (int i = 0; i < points.length - 1; i++) {
      if (points[i] != null && points[i + 1] != null) {
        canvas.drawLine(points[i]!, points[i + 1]!, paint);
      }
    }
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(covariant CustomPainter oldDelegate) {
    return true; // Repaint whenever the points change
  }
}
```

```
// The application starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme, and it directs to the ScribblePage.
// ScribblePage is a stateful widget that maintains a list of points drawn by the user.
// The AppBar contains buttons for saving and undoing the last action.
// The body of the page is a GestureDetector that captures user touch events.
// On pan update, it adds the current touch point to the points list.
// On pan end, it adds a null point to signify the end of a stroke.
// The CustomPaint widget uses the ScribblePainter to draw the points on the canvas.
// ScribblePainter takes the list of points and draws lines between them on the canvas.
// The paint method sets the paint style and draws the lines based on the points.
// The shouldRepaint method ensures the canvas is redrawn whenever the points change.
```

In summary, this blog provides a comprehensive overview of the Scribble Flutter package, including its features, setup instructions, and a complete example. The example demonstrates how to create a simple drawing application, allowing users to draw on the screen, undo their actions, and visualize their drawings in real-time.
