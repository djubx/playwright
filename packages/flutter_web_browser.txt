# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_web_browser

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_web_browser` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_web_browser` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_web_browser: ^0.17.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following lines inside the `<application>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you need to add the following key to your `Info.plist` file to allow arbitrary loads:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to open a web page using the `flutter_web_browser` package.

# Complete Example: Using flutter_web_browser

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_web_browser/flutter_web_browser.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Web Browser Example',
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Web Browser Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // This function is called when the button is pressed
            _openWebPage();
          },
          child: Text('Open Web Page'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void _openWebPage() {
    // This method opens a web page using the flutter_web_browser package
    FlutterWebBrowser.openWebPage(
      url: "https://flutter.dev",
      customTabsOptions: CustomTabsOptions(
        toolbarColor: Colors.deepPurple,
        showTitle: true,
        enableUrlBarHiding: true,
        enableDefaultShare: true,
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home page.
// 3. HomePage contains a button that, when pressed, calls the _openWebPage method.
// 4. The _openWebPage method uses FlutterWebBrowser to open the specified URL in a custom tab.
// 5. The custom tab can be styled with options like toolbar color and title visibility.
```
