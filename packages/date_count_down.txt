# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Date Count Down Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `date_count_down` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  date_count_down: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a countdown timer.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:date_count_down/date_count_down.dart';
```

2. Create a widget that uses the `CountDown` class to display the countdown.

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Date Count Down Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: CountDown(
          date: DateTime(2024, 12, 31, 23, 59, 59), // Set your target date here
          onEnd: () {
            // Action to perform when countdown ends
            print('Countdown finished!');
          },
          builder: (context, remaining) {
            return Text(
              'Time remaining: ${remaining.days} days, ${remaining.hours} hours, ${remaining.minutes} minutes, ${remaining.seconds} seconds',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a simple countdown timer that displays the time remaining until December 31, 2024. The `onEnd` callback can be used to trigger any action when the countdown reaches zero.

# Complete Example of Date Count Down in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:date_count_down/date_count_down.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Date Count Down Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Date Count Down Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: CountDown(
          date: DateTime(2024, 12, 31, 23, 59, 59), // Set your target date here
          onEnd: () {
            // Action to perform when countdown ends
            print('Countdown finished!'); // This will print to the console
          },
          builder: (context, remaining) {
            // This builder function returns the countdown display
            return Text(
              'Time remaining: ${remaining.days} days, ${remaining.hours} hours, ${remaining.minutes} minutes, ${remaining.seconds} seconds',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24), // Styling the text
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home widget as RealFlutter.
// 3. RealFlutter builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a CountDown widget is created with a target date.
// 5. The onEnd callback is defined to print a message when the countdown finishes.
// 6. The builder function formats the remaining time and displays it in a Text widget.
// 7. The countdown updates automatically, showing the time left until the specified date.
```
