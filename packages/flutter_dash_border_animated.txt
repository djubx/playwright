class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {

        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Container(
            // Container to hold the animated dash border
            width: 300,
            height: 200,
            child: DashBorderAnimated(
              // Setting the dash pattern and color
              dashPattern: [8, 4], // 8 pixels dash, 4 pixels space
              color: Colors.blue,
              // Animation duration
              duration: Duration(seconds: 2),
              // Child widget inside the dashed border
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'Hello, Flutter!',
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Container is created to hold the DashBorderAnimated widget.
// 5. The DashBorderAnimated widget is configured with a dash pattern, color, and animation duration.
// 6. The child of the DashBorderAnimated widget is a Center widget that displays a text message.
// 7. When the app runs, the dashed border animates around the text, creating a visually appealing effect.
