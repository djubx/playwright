# Setting Up and Using the pkpass Package
=============================================

To use the `pkpass` package in your Flutter application, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your pubspec.yaml File

Add the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  pkpass: ^1.0.0
```
Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

Import the `pkpass` package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:pkpass/pkpass.dart';
```
### Step 3: Create a Pass

Create a new pass using the `PkPass` class:
```dart
PkPass pass = PkPass(
  id: 'pass-id',
  type: PkPassType.boardingPass,
  title: 'Boarding Pass',
  description: 'Flight from New York to Los Angeles',
  logo: 'assets/logo.png',
  backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
);
```
### Step 4: Add the Pass to Apple Wallet or Google Pay

To add the pass to Apple Wallet or Google Pay, use the `PkPass.add-to-wallet` method:
```dart
pass.addToWallet();
```
This will open the Apple Wallet or Google Pay app and add the pass to the user's wallet.

### Platform-Specific Details

For Android, you need to add the following code to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:
```xml
<application>
  ...
  <meta-data
    android:name="com.google.android.gms.wallet.api.enabled"
    android:value="true" />
</application>
```
For iOS, you need to add the following code to your `Info.plist` file:
```xml
<key>com.apple.developer.passkit</key>
<true/>
```

import 'package:pkpass/pkpass.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'PkPass Demo',
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  PkPass _pass;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _createPass();
  }

  void _createPass() {
    // Create a new pass
    _pass = PkPass(
      id: 'pass-id',
      type: PkPassType.boardingPass,
      title: 'Boarding Pass',
      description: 'Flight from New York to Los Angeles',
      logo: 'assets/logo.png',
      backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
    );
  }

  void _addToWallet() {
    // Add the pass to Apple Wallet or Google Pay
    _pass.addToWallet();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('PkPass Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'PkPass Demo',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _addToWallet,
              child: Text('Add to Wallet'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user opens the app and the _createPass method is called to create a new pass.
// 2. The pass is created with the specified details (id, type, title, description, logo, and background color).
// 3. The user clicks the "Add to Wallet" button, which calls the _addToWallet method.
// 4. The _addToWallet method adds the pass to Apple Wallet or Google Pay using the PkPass.add-to-wallet method.
// 5. The user can then view the pass in their wallet and use it as needed.

// This code demonstrates the basic functionality of the pkpass package, including creating a pass and adding it to Apple Wallet or Google Pay.
