# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Flutter Multi Select Items

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up and using the `flutter_multi_select_items` package in a Flutter application. We will cover platform-specific configurations for both Android and iOS.

## Setup

### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the `flutter_multi_select_items` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_multi_select_items: ^1.0.0
```

### Step 2: Install Packages

Run the following command to install the new package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Step 3: Platform-Specific Configurations

#### Android

Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

#### iOS

Make sure your iOS deployment target is set to 11.0 or higher in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '11.0'
```

## Usage

To use the `flutter_multi_select_items` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_multi_select_items/flutter_multi_select_items.dart';
```

You can then create a multi-select widget using the `RealFlutter` class, which we'll explore in the complete example section.

# Complete Example: Flutter Multi Select Items

Below is a complete example of a Flutter application using the `flutter_multi_select_items` package. This example demonstrates how to create a multi-select widget and handle user selections.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_multi_select_items/flutter_multi_select_items.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Multi Select Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MultiSelectDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class MultiSelectDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MultiSelectDemoState createState() => _MultiSelectDemoState();
}

class _MultiSelectDemoState extends State<MultiSelectDemo> {
  // List of items to select from
  final List<String> _items = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry', 'Date', 'Elderberry'];
  // List to store selected items
  List<String> _selectedItems = [];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Multi Select Example'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            // Multi-select widget
            RealFlutter(
              items: _items,
              onSelectionChanged: (selectedList) {
                setState(() {
                  _selectedItems = selectedList;
                });
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Display selected items
            Text(
              'Selected Items: ${_selectedItems.join(', ')}',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The application starts by running the `MyApp` class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// The `MultiSelectDemo` widget is the main screen, containing a list of items to select from.
// The `RealFlutter` widget is used to display the multi-select options.
// When the selection changes, the `onSelectionChanged` callback updates the `_selectedItems` list.
// The selected items are displayed below the multi-select widget.
