Here's a detailed technical blog on the `force_directed_graphview` Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Force Directed GraphView Flutter Package

The `force_directed_graphview` package is a powerful tool for visualizing graph data structures in Flutter applications. It allows developers to create interactive and dynamic graph representations, making it ideal for applications that require data visualization, such as social networks, organizational charts, or any scenario where relationships between entities need to be displayed.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `force_directed_graphview` package when:
- You need to visualize complex relationships between data points.
- You want to create interactive graphs that allow users to explore data dynamically.
- Your application requires real-time updates to the graph based on user interactions or data changes.

## Features

- **Interactive Graphs**: Users can drag nodes around to explore relationships.
- **Customizable Nodes and Edges**: You can customize the appearance of nodes and edges to fit your application's design.
- **Animation Support**: The package supports animations for smoother transitions when nodes are moved or updated.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Designed to handle large datasets efficiently.

Overall, the `force_directed_graphview` package is an excellent choice for developers looking to implement graph visualizations in their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Force Directed GraphView Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `force_directed_graphview` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  force_directed_graphview: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/force_directed_graphview).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file, especially if you plan to use features that require internet access or other permissions.

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:force_directed_graphview/force_directed_graphview.dart';
```

## Step 4: Basic Usage

You can now start using the `ForceDirectedGraphView` widget in your application. Below is a simple example of how to set up a basic graph.

# Complete Example of Using Force Directed GraphView

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:force_directed_graphview/force_directed_graphview.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Force Directed Graph Example',
      home: GraphScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class GraphScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample data for the graph
    final List<Node> nodes = [
      Node(id: '1', label: 'Node 1'),
      Node(id: '2', label: 'Node 2'),
      Node(id: '3', label: 'Node 3'),
    ];

    final List<Edge> edges = [
      Edge(source: '1', target: '2'),
      Edge(source: '2', target: '3'),
      Edge(source: '1', target: '3'),
    ];

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Force Directed Graph'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ForceDirectedGraphView(
          nodes: nodes,
          edges: edges,
          // Set the size of the graph view
          size: Size(double.infinity, double.infinity),
          // Optional: Customize the node and edge appearance
          nodeBuilder: (context, node) {
            return CircleAvatar(
              child: Text(node.label),
              backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
            );
          },
          edgeBuilder: (context, edge) {
            return Container(
              height: 2,
              width: 2,
              color: Colors.black,
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (GraphScreen).
// 3. GraphScreen creates a list of nodes and edges to represent the graph structure.
// 4. The ForceDirectedGraphView widget is used to display the graph, taking nodes and edges as parameters.
// 5. The nodeBuilder and edgeBuilder functions customize the appearance of nodes and edges.
// 6. The graph is displayed in the center of the screen, allowing users to interact with it.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application that visualizes a force-directed graph. The application consists of three main components: the main function, the MyApp class, and the GraphScreen class. 

### Summary of Application Flow
- The `main` function initializes the app.
- The `MyApp` class sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home screen.
- The `GraphScreen` class defines the nodes and edges of the graph.
- The `ForceDirectedGraphView` widget is used to render the graph, with customizable node and edge builders.
- The application allows users to interact with the graph, dragging nodes to explore relationships.
