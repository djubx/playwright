# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Prayers_Times Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `prayers_times` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `prayers_times` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  prayers_times: ^1.0.0
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the device's location. Open the `AndroidManifest.xml` file located in `android/app/src/main/` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to request location permissions in your `Info.plist` file. Add the following keys:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to provide accurate prayer times.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to provide accurate prayer times.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to retrieve and display prayer times.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:prayers_times/prayers_times.dart';
```

2. Create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class and use it to fetch prayer times based on the user's location.

3. Display the prayer times in your app's UI.

With these steps, you are ready to implement the `prayers_times` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using the Prayers_Times Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:prayers_times/prayers_times.dart';
import 'package:geolocator/geolocator.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Prayer Times',
      home: PrayerTimesScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PrayerTimesScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PrayerTimesScreenState createState() => _PrayerTimesScreenState();
}

class _PrayerTimesScreenState extends State<PrayerTimesScreen> {
  // Declare a variable to hold prayer times
  PrayerTimes? prayerTimes;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Fetch the user's location and prayer times
    _fetchPrayerTimes();
  }

  Future<void> _fetchPrayerTimes() async {
    // Get the current position of the user
    Position position = await Geolocator.getCurrentPosition(desiredAccuracy: LocationAccuracy.high);
    
    // Create an instance of PrayerTimes with the user's location
    prayerTimes = PrayerTimes(
      latitude: position.latitude,
      longitude: position.longitude,
      method: CalculationMethod.MuslimWorldLeague, // Set calculation method
    );

    // Update the state to reflect the fetched prayer times
    setState(() {});
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Prayer Times'),
      ),
      body: prayerTimes == null
          ? Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator()) // Show loading indicator while fetching
          : ListView(
              children: [
                ListTile(
                  title: Text('Fajr: ${prayerTimes!.fajr}'),
                ),
                ListTile(
                  title: Text('Dhuhr: ${prayerTimes!.dhuhr}'),
                ),
                ListTile(
                  title: Text('Asr: ${prayerTimes!.asr}'),
                ),
                ListTile(
                  title: Text('Maghrib: ${prayerTimes!.maghrib}'),
                ),
                ListTile(
                  title: Text('Isha: ${prayerTimes!.isha}'),
                ),
              ],
            ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The PrayerTimesScreen widget is a stateful widget that fetches prayer times.
// 4. In the initState method, it calls _fetchPrayerTimes to get the user's location.
// 5. The user's location is obtained using the Geolocator package.
// 6. An instance of PrayerTimes is created with the user's latitude and longitude.
// 7. The state is updated to reflect the fetched prayer times.
// 8. The build method displays a loading indicator while fetching data.
// 9. Once the prayer times are available, they are displayed in a ListView.
