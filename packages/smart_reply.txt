# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Smart Reply Package

## Installation
To add the **smart_reply** package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  smart_reply: ^latest_version
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
1. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21.
2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml` if required by your use case.

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add any required permissions or configurations.

## Basic Usage
To use the **smart_reply** package, you need to initialize it and then call the method to get suggestions based on user input.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:smart_reply/smart_reply.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Smart Reply Example')),
        body: SmartReplyWidget(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SmartReplyWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SmartReplyWidgetState createState() => _SmartReplyWidgetState();
}

class _SmartReplyWidgetState extends State<SmartReplyWidget> {
  List<String> suggestions = [];

  void getSuggestions(String input) async {
    // Call the smart reply method to get suggestions
    suggestions = await SmartReply.getSuggestions(input);
    setState(() {});
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        TextField(
          onChanged: getSuggestions,
          decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Type a message'),
        ),
        Expanded(
          child: ListView.builder(
            itemCount: suggestions.length,
            itemBuilder: (context, index) {
              return ListTile(title: Text(suggestions[index]));
            },
          ),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Smart Reply in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:smart_reply/smart_reply.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Smart Reply Example')),
        body: SmartReplyWidget(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SmartReplyWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SmartReplyWidgetState createState() => _SmartReplyWidgetState();
}

class _SmartReplyWidgetState extends State<SmartReplyWidget> {
  List<String> suggestions = []; // List to hold the suggestions

  void getSuggestions(String input) async {
    // Call the smart reply method to get suggestions based on user input
    suggestions = await SmartReply.getSuggestions(input);
    setState(() {}); // Update the UI with new suggestions
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        TextField(
          onChanged: getSuggestions, // Trigger suggestions on text change
          decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Type a message'),
        ),
        Expanded(
          child: ListView.builder(
            itemCount: suggestions.length, // Number of suggestions
            itemBuilder: (context, index) {
              return ListTile(title: Text(suggestions[index])); // Display each suggestion
            },
          ),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The SmartReplyWidget is displayed in the body of the Scaffold.
// 3. Inside SmartReplyWidget, a TextField is provided for user input.
// 4. As the user types, the getSuggestions method is called, which fetches suggestions from the smart_reply package.
// 5. The suggestions are stored in a list and displayed in a ListView below the TextField.
// 6. The UI updates automatically whenever new suggestions are fetched, providing a seamless user experience.
