# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Select Field Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `select_field` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  select_field: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Select Field

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a select field.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:select_field/select_field.dart';
```

2. Create a list of options for the select field:

```dart
final List<Map<String, dynamic>> options = [
  {"display": "Option 1", "value": 1},
  {"display": "Option 2", "value": 2},
  {"display": "Option 3", "value": 3},
];
```

3. Use the `SelectField` widget in your UI:

```dart
SelectField(
  items: options,
  label: 'Select an Option',
  onChanged: (value) {
    // Handle the selected value
    print('Selected value: $value');
  },
);
```

With these steps, you can easily integrate the `select_field` package into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using the Select Field Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:select_field/select_field.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Select Field Example',
      home: SelectFieldDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class SelectFieldDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SelectFieldDemoState createState() => _SelectFieldDemoState();
}

class _SelectFieldDemoState extends State<SelectFieldDemo> {
  // List of options for the select field
  final List<Map<String, dynamic>> options = [
    {"display": "Option 1", "value": 1},
    {"display": "Option 2", "value": 2},
    {"display": "Option 3", "value": 3},
  ];

  // Variable to hold the selected value
  int? selectedValue;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Select Field Example'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            // SelectField widget for user selection
            SelectField(
              items: options,
              label: 'Select an Option',
              onChanged: (value) {
                // Update the selected value when an option is chosen
                setState(() {
                  selectedValue = value;
                });
                // Print the selected value to the console
                print('Selected value: $value');
              },
              // Display the selected value in the dropdown
              value: selectedValue,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Display the selected value below the dropdown
            Text(
              selectedValue != null
                  ? 'You selected: Option $selectedValue'
                  : 'No option selected',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets MyApp as the root widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and home set to SelectFieldDemo.
// 3. SelectFieldDemo is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the selected value.
// 4. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body containing a SelectField.
// 5. The SelectField is populated with options and updates the selectedValue state when an option is chosen.
// 6. The selected value is displayed below the dropdown, providing immediate feedback to the user.
