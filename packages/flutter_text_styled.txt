# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_text_styled

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with `flutter_text_styled`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_text_styled: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use `flutter_text_styled`:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_text_styled/flutter_text_styled.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Text Styled Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: StyledText(
            text: 'Hello, Flutter! This is styled text.',
            styles: {
              'Hello': TextStyle(color: Colors.blue, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
              'styled text': TextStyle(color: Colors.red, fontStyle: FontStyle.italic),
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays styled text using the `StyledText` widget from the `flutter_text_styled` package.

# Complete Example of flutter_text_styled

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_text_styled/flutter_text_styled.dart';

// Main class of the Flutter application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Text Styled Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Using StyledText widget to display text with different styles
          child: StyledText(
            text: 'Hello, Flutter! This is styled text.',
            styles: {
              // Applying blue color and bold style to the word "Hello"
              'Hello': TextStyle(color: Colors.blue, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
              // Applying red color and italic style to the phrase "styled text"
              'styled text': TextStyle(color: Colors.red, fontStyle: FontStyle.italic),
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp, which provides the basic structure of the app.
// 3. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold widget is created, which includes an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body contains a Center widget that centers its child widget.
// 5. The child of the Center widget is a StyledText widget, which takes a string of text and a map of styles.
// 6. The StyledText widget applies the specified styles to the corresponding parts of the text, resulting in a rich text display.
```
