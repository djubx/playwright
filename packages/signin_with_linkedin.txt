Here's a detailed technical blog on the `signin_with_linkedin` Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Sign In with LinkedIn Flutter Package

The `signin_with_linkedin` Flutter package provides a seamless way to integrate LinkedIn authentication into your Flutter applications. This package simplifies the process of signing in users with their LinkedIn accounts, allowing developers to focus on building features rather than handling authentication complexities.

You should consider using the `signin_with_linkedin` package when:
- You want to allow users to log in to your app using their LinkedIn credentials.
- Your application requires access to LinkedIn user data, such as profile information, connections, or job history.
- You are building a professional networking app, job board, or any application that benefits from LinkedIn integration.

## Features

- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup process for both Android and iOS platforms.
- **User Profile Access**: Retrieve user profile information after authentication.
- **Token Management**: Handles OAuth tokens securely.
- **Customizable**: Allows customization of the sign-in flow to match your app's design.

# Tutorial: Setting Up the Sign In with LinkedIn Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `signin_with_linkedin` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

First, add the `signin_with_linkedin` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  signin_with_linkedin: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/signin_with_linkedin).

## Step 2: Configure LinkedIn Application

### For Android

1. Go to the [LinkedIn Developer Portal](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/).
2. Create a new application and note down the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
3. In the application settings, add your app's package name and the redirect URL (e.g., `https://yourapp.com/auth/linkedin`).
4. Ensure that the **OAuth 2.0** settings are configured correctly.

### For iOS

1. In the LinkedIn Developer Portal, follow the same steps to create an application.
2. Add your app's bundle identifier in the application settings.
3. Configure the redirect URL similarly to the Android setup.

## Step 3: Implementing the Sign-In Flow

Now, let's implement the sign-in flow in your Flutter application. Below is a sample implementation.

<!-- END_TUTORIAL -->

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:signin_with_linkedin/signin_with_linkedin.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'LinkedIn Sign In Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _profileData = '';

  // Function to handle LinkedIn sign-in
  void _signInWithLinkedIn() async {
    // Start the LinkedIn sign-in process
    final result = await SignInWithLinkedIn.getLinkedInAuth(
      clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID', // Replace with your LinkedIn Client ID
      clientSecret: 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET', // Replace with your LinkedIn Client Secret
      redirectUri: 'YOUR_REDIRECT_URI', // Replace with your redirect URI
      scope: ['r_liteprofile', 'r_emailaddress'], // Define the scopes you need
    );

    // Check if the sign-in was successful
    if (result != null) {
      // If successful, retrieve the profile data
      setState(() {
        _profileData = result.toString(); // Store the profile data
      });
    } else {
      // Handle sign-in failure
      setState(() {
        _profileData = 'Sign-in failed';
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('LinkedIn Sign In'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _signInWithLinkedIn, // Trigger sign-in on button press
              child: Text('Sign in with LinkedIn'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(_profileData), // Display the profile data or error message
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
 
// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application that integrates LinkedIn sign-in functionality. 
// Here's a step-by-step explanation of the application flow:

// 1. **Main Function**: The `main` function initializes the app and sets `MyApp` as the home widget.
// 2. **MyApp Class**: This class builds the main MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. **RealFlutter Class**: This is the main stateful widget where the LinkedIn sign-in logic resides.
// 4. **_signInWithLinkedIn Method**: This method handles the sign-in process. It calls `SignInWithLinkedIn.getLinkedInAuth` with the required parameters (client ID, client secret, redirect URI, and scopes).
// 5. **Profile Data Handling**: If the sign-in is successful, the profile data is stored in the `_profileData` variable and displayed on the screen. If it fails, an error message is shown.
// 6. **UI Layout**: The UI consists of a button to trigger the sign-in process and a text widget to display the profile data or error message.

// This application flow allows users to sign in with their LinkedIn accounts and view their profile data, demonstrating the core functionality of the `signin_with_linkedin` package.
