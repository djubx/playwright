import 'package:dropdown_plus_plus/dropdown_plus_plus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dropdown Plus Plus Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Dropdown Plus Plus Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: DropdownExample(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DropdownExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DropdownExampleState createState() => _DropdownExampleState();
}

class _DropdownExampleState extends State<DropdownExample> {
  // Variable to hold the selected value
  String? selectedValue;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        // Dropdown widget
        DropdownPlusPlus(
          items: ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3'],
          onChanged: (value) {
            // Update the selected value when an option is chosen
            setState(() {
              selectedValue = value;
            });
          },
          hint: 'Select an option', // Hint text for the dropdown
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between dropdown and text
        // Display the selected value
        Text(
          selectedValue != null ? 'Selected: $selectedValue' : 'No option selected',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp and Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a body with a centered DropdownExample widget.
// 4. DropdownExample is a StatefulWidget that manages the selected value.
// 5. The DropdownPlusPlus widget is used to create a dropdown menu with three options.
// 6. When an option is selected, the onChanged callback updates the selectedValue state.
// 7. The selected value is displayed below the dropdown, updating dynamically as the user makes a selection.
