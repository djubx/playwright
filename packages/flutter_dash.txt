# Setting Up and Using the Flutter Dash Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `flutter_dash` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_dash: ^0.1.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the `flutter_dash` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_dash/flutter_dash.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

### Basic Usage

You can use the `Dash` widget provided by the package to create dashed lines. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
Dash(
  direction: Axis.horizontal, // Direction of the dash
  length: 4.0,                // Length of each dash
  dashColor: Colors.black,     // Color of the dashes
  dashGap: 2.0,                // Gap between dashes
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

#### iOS

For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Customizing the Dash

You can customize the dash further by adjusting the properties such as `length`, `dashColor`, and `dashGap` to fit your design requirements.

### Example of a Dashed Border

To create a dashed border around a container, you can wrap the container with a `Dash` widget:

```dart
Container(
  child: Dash(
    direction: Axis.horizontal,
    length: 4.0,
    dashColor: Colors.blue,
    dashGap: 2.0,
  ),
)
```

This will create a horizontal dashed line that can be used as a border or separator in your UI.

# Complete Example of Using Flutter Dash

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_dash/flutter_dash.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Dash Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Dash Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // A container with a dashed border
              Container(
                padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
                child: Dash(
                  direction: Axis.horizontal, // Set the direction of the dash
                  length: 10.0,               // Length of each dash
                  dashColor: Colors.red,       // Color of the dashes
                  dashGap: 5.0,                // Gap between dashes
                ),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between elements
              // Another dashed line
              Dash(
                direction: Axis.vertical, // Vertical dashed line
                length: 20.0,             // Length of each dash
                dashColor: Colors.green,   // Color of the dashes
                dashGap: 4.0,              // Gap between dashes
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Flutter Dash Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Column widget.
// 5. The first child of the Column is a Container that has a dashed border created using the Dash widget.
// 6. The second child is a vertical dashed line created using another Dash widget.
// 7. The layout is responsive and will adjust based on the screen size.
```
