# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Huawei IAP Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the `huawei_iap` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  huawei_iap: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Configure Android
For Android, you need to perform the following steps:

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Add the necessary permissions and metadata in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<manifest>
    <application>
        ...
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.huawei.hms.client.appid"
            android:value="your_app_id" />
    </application>
</manifest>
```

Replace `your_app_id` with your actual Huawei App ID.

2. **Enable Billing in AppGallery**: Ensure that your app is configured for in-app purchases in the Huawei AppGallery Console.

## Step 3: Configure iOS
For iOS, the `huawei_iap` package does not require specific configurations, but ensure that your app complies with Apple's guidelines for in-app purchases.

## Step 4: Initialize the Package
In your Flutter application, initialize the `huawei_iap` package in your main file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:huawei_iap/huawei_iap.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Huawei IAP Demo',
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Implementing In-App Purchases
You can now implement in-app purchases in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initiate a purchase:

```dart
class HomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomePageState createState() => _HomePageState();
}

class _HomePageState extends State<HomePage> {
  // Method to initiate a purchase
  void _purchaseProduct() async {
    // Create a product request
    final productId = 'your_product_id';
    final purchaseResult = await IapClient.createPurchaseIntent(productId);

    // Handle the purchase result
    if (purchaseResult != null) {
      // Process the purchase
      print('Purchase successful: ${purchaseResult.orderId}');
    } else {
      print('Purchase failed');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Huawei IAP Demo')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _purchaseProduct,
          child: Text('Buy Product'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple UI with a button that initiates a purchase when pressed. The purchase result is then processed accordingly.

# Complete Example of Huawei IAP in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:huawei_iap/huawei_iap.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Huawei IAP Demo',
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomePageState createState() => _HomePageState();
}

class _HomePageState extends State<HomePage> {
  // Method to initiate a purchase
  void _purchaseProduct() async {
    // Create a product request
    final productId = 'your_product_id'; // Replace with your actual product ID
    final purchaseResult = await IapClient.createPurchaseIntent(productId);

    // Handle the purchase result
    if (purchaseResult != null) {
      // Process the purchase
      print('Purchase successful: ${purchaseResult.orderId}');
    } else {
      print('Purchase failed');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Huawei IAP Demo')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _purchaseProduct, // Trigger purchase on button press
          child: Text('Buy Product'), // Button label
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home page (HomePage).
// 3. HomePage is a stateful widget that manages its state with _HomePageState.
// 4. When the user presses the "Buy Product" button, the _purchaseProduct method is called.
// 5. Inside _purchaseProduct, a purchase request is created using the product ID.
// 6. The purchase result is awaited, and if successful, the order ID is printed.
// 7. If the purchase fails, an error message is printed.
```
