  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {

          _mapController = controller;
        },
        initialCameraPosition: CameraPosition(
          target: LatLng(37.7749, -122.4194),
          zoom: 12,
        ),
        markers: {
          Marker(
            markerId: MarkerId('marker'),
            position: LatLng(37.7749, -122.4194),
            infoWindow: InfoWindow(
              title: 'San Francisco',
              snippet: 'This is a label',
            ),
          ),
        },
        labelMarkers: {
          LabelMarker(
            marker: Marker(
              markerId: MarkerId('marker'),
              position: LatLng(37.7749, -122.4194),
            ),
            label: Text('San Francisco'),
            controller: _labelMarkerController,
          ),
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user opens the app and is presented with a map.
// 2. The map is centered on a specific location (in this case, San Francisco).
// 3. A marker is added to the map at the centered location.
// 4. A label is added to the marker with the text "San Francisco".
// 5. The user can interact with the map (e.g. zoom in/out, pan) and the label will remain attached to the marker.
// 6. The user can also programmatically control the label using the LabelMarkerController class.

// This code demonstrates the basic usage of the label_marker package.
// It shows how to add a marker with a label to a map and how to customize the label style and layout.
// It also shows how to use the LabelMarkerController class to programmatically control the label.
