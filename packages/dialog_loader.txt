# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Dialog Loader

## Installation
To add the `dialog_loader` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dialog_loader: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/dialog_loader).

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. The package works out of the box.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your project is set up to support the latest iOS version. You may need to update your `Info.plist` file if you are using any specific permissions related to network requests.

## Basic Usage
To use the `dialog_loader` package, follow these steps:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:
   ```dart
   import 'package:dialog_loader/dialog_loader.dart';
   ```

2. Show a loading dialog when starting an asynchronous operation:
   ```dart
   DialogLoader.showLoadingDialog(context);
   ```

3. Hide the loading dialog once the operation is complete:
   ```dart
   DialogLoader.hideLoadingDialog(context);
   ```

This simple API allows you to manage loading states effectively in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Using Dialog Loader

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dialog_loader/dialog_loader.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dialog Loader Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Dialog Loader Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () async {
            // Show the loading dialog
            DialogLoader.showLoadingDialog(context);
            // Simulate a network request or a long-running task
            await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3));
            // Hide the loading dialog
            DialogLoader.hideLoadingDialog(context);
            // Show a success message
            ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
              SnackBar(content: Text('Operation completed!')),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Start Operation'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget contains a button that, when pressed, triggers an asynchronous operation.
// 4. Upon pressing the button, the loading dialog is displayed using DialogLoader.showLoadingDialog(context).
// 5. A simulated delay of 3 seconds is introduced to mimic a network request.
// 6. After the delay, the loading dialog is hidden using DialogLoader.hideLoadingDialog(context).
// 7. Finally, a SnackBar is shown to inform the user that the operation has been completed.
