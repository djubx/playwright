Here's a detailed technical blog on the "expandable" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Expandable Flutter Package

The **Expandable** package for Flutter is a powerful tool that allows developers to create expandable and collapsible widgets with ease. This package is particularly useful when you want to display additional information without cluttering the UI. It can be used in various scenarios, such as displaying FAQs, lists of items, or any content that can be expanded or collapsed based on user interaction.

## Features
- **Expandable Widget**: The core widget that allows for expansion and collapse.
- **Customizable**: You can customize the header, body, and the animation of the expansion.
- **Multiple Expandable Widgets**: Supports multiple expandable widgets in a single view.
- **Animation**: Smooth animations for expanding and collapsing actions.

## When to Use
- When you have a list of items that can be expanded to show more details.
- In FAQ sections where questions can be clicked to reveal answers.
- For displaying additional content in a clean and organized manner.

The Expandable package enhances user experience by keeping the interface clean while providing access to additional information when needed.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Expandable Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the Expandable package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  expandable: ^5.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, make sure your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:expandable/expandable.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Expandable Widget
You can now use the `Expandable` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
ExpandablePanel(
  header: Text("Header Text"),
  expanded: Text("This is the expanded content."),
  collapsed: Text("This is the collapsed content."),
)
```

This will create a simple expandable panel with a header and content that can be expanded or collapsed.

# Complete Example of Using the Expandable Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:expandable/expandable.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Expandable Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Expandable Widget Example'),
        ),
        body: ListView(
          children: <Widget>[
            ExpandablePanel(
              header: Text(
                "Expandable Header 1",
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
              ),
              expanded: Text(
                "This is the expanded content for header 1. Here you can add more details or information.",
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
              ),
              collapsed: Text(
                "Tap to expand",
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16, color: Colors.blue),
              ),
            ),
            ExpandablePanel(
              header: Text(
                "Expandable Header 2",
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
              ),
              expanded: Text(
                "This is the expanded content for header 2. You can include any widget here.",
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
              ),
              collapsed: Text(
                "Tap to expand",
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16, color: Colors.blue),
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The above code creates a simple Flutter application with two expandable panels.
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets the home widget.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp and Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a ListView to hold the expandable panels.
// 4. Each ExpandablePanel has a header, expanded content, and collapsed content.
// 5. When the user taps on the collapsed text, the panel expands to show more information.
// 6. The text styles are customized for better visibility and user experience.

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the Expandable package. The application consists of two expandable panels, each with a header and content that can be expanded or collapsed. The comments within the code explain the flow of the application step-by-step, making it easy to understand how the Expandable package works in practice.
