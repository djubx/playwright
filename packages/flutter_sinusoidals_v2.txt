## <-- START_DESCRIPTION -->

### Overview of flutter_sinusoidals_v2

The `flutter_sinusoidals_v2` package is a powerful Flutter library designed to create sinusoidal wave animations and visualizations. This package is particularly useful for developers looking to add dynamic and visually appealing wave effects to their applications, such as in music visualizers, loading indicators, or any application that benefits from fluid motion.

### When to Use This Package

You might consider using `flutter_sinusoidals_v2` in scenarios such as:
- Creating engaging loading animations.
- Developing music or sound visualizers that respond to audio input.
- Enhancing user interfaces with smooth, flowing animations.

### Key Features

- **Customizable Wave Properties**: Adjust amplitude, frequency, and phase to create unique waveforms.
- **Animation Control**: Start, stop, and control the speed of the wave animations.
- **Responsive Design**: The package is designed to work seamlessly across different screen sizes and orientations.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that allows for quick implementation in any Flutter project.

### Setup Process

To get started with the `flutter_sinusoidals_v2` package, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     flutter_sinusoidals_v2: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
   ```

2. **Install the Package**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21.
   - **iOS**: No specific configurations are required, but ensure you have the latest version of Xcode.

### Using the Package

To use the `flutter_sinusoidals_v2` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_sinusoidals_v2/flutter_sinusoidals_v2.dart';
```

You can then create a `Sinusoidal` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
Sinusoidal(
  amplitude: 20.0, // Height of the wave
  frequency: 1.0,  // Number of waves
  phase: 0.0,      // Starting point of the wave
  speed: 1.0,      // Speed of the wave animation
)
```

## <-- START_MAIN -->

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_sinusoidals_v2/flutter_sinusoidals_v2.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sinusoidal Wave Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Sinusoidal Wave Animation'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Sinusoidal(
            amplitude: 20.0, // Set the height of the wave
            frequency: 1.0,  // Set the number of waves
            phase: 0.0,      // Set the starting point of the wave
            speed: 1.0,      // Set the speed of the wave animation
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The above code sets up a simple Flutter application with a sinusoidal wave animation.
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. Inside the MaterialApp, we define a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. The Center widget contains the Sinusoidal widget, which is responsible for rendering the wave.
// 5. The Sinusoidal widget takes parameters like amplitude, frequency, phase, and speed to customize the wave's appearance and behavior.
// 6. The amplitude controls the height of the wave, frequency determines how many waves are displayed, phase sets the starting point, and speed controls how fast the wave animates.
// 7. When the app runs, users will see a sinusoidal wave animation in the center of the screen, providing a dynamic visual experience.
```
