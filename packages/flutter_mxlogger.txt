# flutter_mxlogger: A Comprehensive Logging Solution for Flutter

## Overview

The `flutter_mxlogger` package is a powerful logging tool designed for Flutter applications. It provides a simple and efficient way to log messages, errors, and other important information during the development and production phases of your app. This package is particularly useful for debugging and monitoring the performance of your application.

### When to Use `flutter_mxlogger`

- **Debugging**: When you need to track down issues in your code, logging can help you understand the flow of your application and identify where things go wrong.
- **Monitoring**: In production, logging can help you monitor the health of your application and catch errors before they affect users.
- **Analytics**: You can log user interactions and events to gather insights into how users are engaging with your app.

### Features

- **Customizable Log Levels**: You can set different log levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) to filter the logs based on severity.
- **File Logging**: The package supports logging to files, making it easier to review logs after the app has run.
- **Console Logging**: You can also log messages to the console for immediate feedback during development.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

## Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `flutter_mxlogger`

### Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_mxlogger` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_mxlogger: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

### Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_mxlogger/flutter_mxlogger.dart';
```

### Step 3: Initializing the Logger

You need to initialize the logger in your main application file. Here’s how to do it:

```dart
void main() {
  // Initialize the logger
  Logger.init();
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

### Step 4: Using the Logger

You can now use the logger throughout your application. Here’s an example of how to log messages:

```dart
Logger.d("This is a debug message");
Logger.i("This is an info message");
Logger.w("This is a warning message");
Logger.e("This is an error message");
```

### Platform-Specific Configurations

#### Android

For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` if you plan to log to external storage:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

#### iOS

For iOS, you may need to configure your app's Info.plist to allow file access if you are logging to files. Add the following:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save logs.</string>
```

### Optimizations

- **Log Rotation**: Implement log rotation to manage log file sizes.
- **Conditional Logging**: Use environment variables to enable or disable logging in production.

## Complete Example: A Flutter Application Using `flutter_mxlogger`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_mxlogger/flutter_mxlogger.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the logger
  Logger.init();
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter MXLogger Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Log an info message when the button is pressed
            Logger.i("Button pressed!");
            // Simulate an error for demonstration
            try {
              throw Exception("Simulated error");
            } catch (e) {
              // Log the error
              Logger.e("An error occurred: $e");
            }
          },
          child: Text('Press Me'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the logger and runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget contains a button.
// 4. When the button is pressed, an info log is created.
// 5. An exception is thrown to simulate an error, which is caught and logged as an error.
// 6. This demonstrates how to use the logger for both informational and error logging.
```
