Here's a detailed technical blog on the "root_access" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Root Access Flutter Package

The `root_access` Flutter package provides a way to check and request root access on Android devices. This package is particularly useful for applications that require elevated permissions to perform certain tasks, such as modifying system files or accessing restricted areas of the device. 

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the `root_access` package in scenarios such as:
- **Device Management Applications**: Apps that need to manage device settings or configurations that require root access.
- **Custom ROM Development**: Tools that assist in the development or management of custom ROMs.
- **Security Applications**: Apps that perform security checks or modifications that require elevated permissions.

## Features

- **Check Root Access**: Easily check if the device has root access.
- **Request Root Access**: Request root access from the user.
- **Execute Commands**: Run shell commands with root privileges.

The package is designed to be simple and straightforward, making it easy for developers to integrate root access functionality into their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Root Access Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To use the `root_access` package, add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  root_access: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions. Add the following lines inside the `<manifest>` tag:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_SUPERUSER"/>
   ```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Make sure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS Configuration

Currently, the `root_access` package is primarily designed for Android. iOS does not support root access in the same way, so this package will not function on iOS devices.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Hereâ€™s how to use the `root_access` package in your Flutter application:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:root_access/root_access.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Root Access Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Check if the device is rooted
              bool isRooted = await RootAccess.isRooted();
              if (isRooted) {
                // Request root access
                bool granted = await RootAccess.requestRootAccess();
                if (granted) {
                  // Execute a command with root access
                  String result = await RootAccess.executeCommand('ls /data');
                  print(result); // Output the result of the command
                } else {
                  print('Root access denied');
                }
              } else {
                print('Device is not rooted');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Check Root Access'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that checks for root access when a button is pressed. If the device is rooted, it requests root access and executes a command.

# Complete Example of Using the Root Access Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:root_access/root_access.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Root Access Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Check if the device is rooted
              bool isRooted = await RootAccess.isRooted();
              if (isRooted) {
                // Request root access
                bool granted = await RootAccess.requestRootAccess();
                if (granted) {
                  // Execute a command with root access
                  String result = await RootAccess.executeCommand('ls /data');
                  print(result); // Output the result of the command
                } else {
                  print('Root access denied');
                }
              } else {
                print('Device is not rooted');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Check Root Access'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and displays a button labeled "Check Root Access".
// 2. When the button is pressed, the app checks if the device is rooted using `RootAccess.isRooted()`.
// 3. If the device is rooted, it requests root access using `RootAccess.requestRootAccess()`.
// 4. If root access is granted, it executes a shell command (`ls /data`) with root privileges using `RootAccess.executeCommand()`.
// 5. The result of the command is printed to the console.
// 6. If the device is not rooted or if root access is denied, appropriate messages are printed to the console.
```

In summary, this blog provides a comprehensive overview of the `root_access` Flutter package, including its features, setup instructions, and a complete example. The application flow is clearly explained through comments, making it easy for developers to understand how to implement and utilize root access in their Flutter applications.
