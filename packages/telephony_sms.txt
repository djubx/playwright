# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Telephony SMS Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the **telephony_sms** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  telephony_sms: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/telephony_sms).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SEND_SMS"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_SMS"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_SMS"/>
```

3. Ensure that your app's `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 16 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 16
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request permission for SMS:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to send images via SMS.</string>
<key>NSContactsUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your contacts to send SMS to them.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have configured the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to send an SMS.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:telephony_sms/telephony_sms.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  final TelephonySms telephony = TelephonySms();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Telephony SMS Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Check for permissions
              final isGranted = await telephony.requestSmsPermissions;
              if (isGranted) {
                // Send SMS
                telephony.sendSms(
                  to: '1234567890', // Replace with the recipient's phone number
                  message: 'Hello from Flutter!',
                );
              } else {
                // Handle permission denial
                print('SMS permission denied');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Send SMS'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Telephony SMS Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:telephony_sms/telephony_sms.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  // Create an instance of the TelephonySms class
  final TelephonySms telephony = TelephonySms();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Telephony SMS Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Request SMS permissions from the user
              final isGranted = await telephony.requestSmsPermissions;
              if (isGranted) {
                // If permissions are granted, send an SMS
                telephony.sendSms(
                  to: '1234567890', // Replace with the recipient's phone number
                  message: 'Hello from Flutter!',
                );
              } else {
                // If permissions are denied, print a message
                print('SMS permission denied');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Send SMS'), // Button to trigger SMS sending
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and displays a button labeled "Send SMS".
// 2. When the button is pressed, the app requests SMS permissions from the user.
// 3. If the user grants permission, the app sends an SMS to the specified phone number.
// 4. If permission is denied, a message is printed to the console indicating the denial.
