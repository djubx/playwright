# Image Picker Type Flutter Package

The `image_picker_type` Flutter package is a powerful tool that simplifies the process of selecting images from the device's gallery or capturing them using the camera. This package is particularly useful for applications that require user-generated content, such as social media apps, photo editing tools, or any app that needs to allow users to upload images.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `image_picker_type` package when:
- You need to allow users to select images from their device's gallery.
- You want to enable users to capture images directly using the device's camera.
- Your application requires image processing or manipulation after selection.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Customizable Image Source**: Choose between the camera or gallery for image selection.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that integrates well with existing Flutter applications.
- **Image Quality Control**: Options to specify the quality of the images captured or selected.

Overall, the `image_picker_type` package is an essential tool for Flutter developers looking to enhance their applications with image selection capabilities.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Image Picker Type Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `image_picker_type` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `image_picker_type` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  image_picker_type: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request permission for camera and photo library access:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to take photos.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to select photos.</string>
```

## Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:image_picker_type/image_picker_type.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the `ImagePickerType` class to pick images. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
// Create an instance of ImagePickerType
final ImagePickerType _picker = ImagePickerType();
```

You can then use methods like `pickImage` to allow users to select images from their gallery or capture them using the camera.

This concludes the setup and usage tutorial for the `image_picker_type` package. In the next section, we will provide a complete example of a Flutter application that demonstrates all key features of the package.

# Complete Example of Using Image Picker Type

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:image_picker_type/image_picker_type.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Image Picker Example',
      home: ImagePickerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ImagePickerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ImagePickerScreenState createState() => _ImagePickerScreenState();
}

class _ImagePickerScreenState extends State<ImagePickerScreen> {
  // Variable to hold the selected image
  String? _imagePath;

  // Instance of ImagePickerType
  final ImagePickerType _picker = ImagePickerType();

  // Function to pick an image from the gallery
  Future<void> _pickImageFromGallery() async {
    // Use the pickImage method to select an image
    final pickedFile = await _picker.pickImage(source: ImageSource.gallery);
    // Update the state with the selected image path
    setState(() {
      _imagePath = pickedFile?.path;
    });
  }

  // Function to capture an image using the camera
  Future<void> _captureImageWithCamera() async {
    // Use the pickImage method to capture an image
    final pickedFile = await _picker.pickImage(source: ImageSource.camera);
    // Update the state with the captured image path
    setState(() {
      _imagePath = pickedFile?.path;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Image Picker Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display the selected image if available
            _imagePath != null
                ? Image.file(File(_imagePath!))
                : Text('No image selected.'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to pick an image from the gallery
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _pickImageFromGallery,
              child: Text('Pick Image from Gallery'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 10),
            // Button to capture an image using the camera
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _captureImageWithCamera,
              child: Text('Capture Image with Camera'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets ImagePickerScreen as the home.
// 3. ImagePickerScreen is a stateful widget that manages the state of the selected image.
// 4. The _imagePath variable holds the path of the selected or captured image.
// 5. The _pickImageFromGallery function allows users to select an image from the gallery.
// 6. The _captureImageWithCamera function allows users to capture an image using the camera.
// 7. The build method displays the selected image or a message if no image is selected.
// 8. Two buttons are provided to trigger the image selection and capture functions.
