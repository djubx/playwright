# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Vitality Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the Vitality package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the Vitality package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  vitality: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open the `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open the `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions to allow the app to monitor network usage:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the Vitality package:

```dart
import 'package:vitality/vitality.dart';
```

## Step 4: Initializing Vitality

You can initialize the Vitality package in your main application file. Here’s how to do it:

```dart
void main() {
  Vitality.initialize();
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 5: Using Vitality in Your App

You can now use the Vitality package to monitor performance metrics. Here’s a simple example of how to display CPU and memory usage:

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Vitality Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: PerformanceMetrics(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class PerformanceMetrics extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PerformanceMetricsState createState() => _PerformanceMetricsState();
}

class _PerformanceMetricsState extends State<PerformanceMetrics> {
  double cpuUsage = 0.0;
  double memoryUsage = 0.0;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _startMonitoring();
  }

  void _startMonitoring() {
    Vitality.onCpuUsageChanged.listen((usage) {
      setState(() {
        cpuUsage = usage;
      });
    });

    Vitality.onMemoryUsageChanged.listen((usage) {
      setState(() {
        memoryUsage = usage;
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Text('CPU Usage: ${cpuUsage.toStringAsFixed(2)}%'),
        Text('Memory Usage: ${memoryUsage.toStringAsFixed(2)} MB'),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a simple Flutter application that displays the current CPU and memory usage in real-time.

# Complete Example of a Flutter Application Using Vitality

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:vitality/vitality.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the Vitality package to start monitoring
  Vitality.initialize();
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Vitality Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: PerformanceMetrics(), // Display performance metrics
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class PerformanceMetrics extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PerformanceMetricsState createState() => _PerformanceMetricsState();
}

class _PerformanceMetricsState extends State<PerformanceMetrics> {
  double cpuUsage = 0.0; // Variable to hold CPU usage
  double memoryUsage = 0.0; // Variable to hold memory usage

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _startMonitoring(); // Start monitoring performance metrics
  }

  void _startMonitoring() {
    // Listen for changes in CPU usage
    Vitality.onCpuUsageChanged.listen((usage) {
      setState(() {
        cpuUsage = usage; // Update CPU usage variable
      });
    });

    // Listen for changes in memory usage
    Vitality.onMemoryUsageChanged.listen((usage) {
      setState(() {
        memoryUsage = usage; // Update memory usage variable
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        // Display the current CPU usage
        Text('CPU Usage: ${cpuUsage.toStringAsFixed(2)}%'),
        // Display the current memory usage
        Text('Memory Usage: ${memoryUsage.toStringAsFixed(2)} MB'),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Vitality package and runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a centered PerformanceMetrics widget.
// 3. The PerformanceMetrics widget is a StatefulWidget that monitors CPU and memory usage.
// 4. In the initState method, the _startMonitoring function is called to set up listeners for CPU and memory usage changes.
// 5. When CPU or memory usage changes, the corresponding variable is updated, and the UI is rebuilt to reflect the new values.
```
