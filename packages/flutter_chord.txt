# Setting Up the Flutter Chord Package

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_chord` package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter applications.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_chord` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_chord: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add permissions for microphone access if you are using audio input features. Open your `Info.plist` file and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to the microphone for chord recognition.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement chord recognition and visualization.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_chord/flutter_chord.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Chord Example',
      home: ChordHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class ChordHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ChordHomePageState createState() => _ChordHomePageState();
}

class _ChordHomePageState extends State<ChordHomePage> {
  String _recognizedChord = 'No chord recognized';

  void _recognizeChord() {
    // Call the chord recognition method from the flutter_chord package
    String chord = FlutterChord.recognizeChord();
    setState(() {
      _recognizedChord = chord;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Chord Recognition'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Recognized Chord:',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            Text(
              _recognizedChord,
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _recognizeChord,
              child: Text('Recognize Chord'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Flutter Chord Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_chord/flutter_chord.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Chord Example',
      home: ChordHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class ChordHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ChordHomePageState createState() => _ChordHomePageState();
}

class _ChordHomePageState extends State<ChordHomePage> {
  String _recognizedChord = 'No chord recognized'; // Variable to hold recognized chord

  void _recognizeChord() {
    // Call the chord recognition method from the flutter_chord package
    String chord = FlutterChord.recognizeChord(); // Recognize the chord
    setState(() {
      _recognizedChord = chord; // Update the state with the recognized chord
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Chord Recognition'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Recognized Chord:', // Label for recognized chord
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            Text(
              _recognizedChord, // Display the recognized chord
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between elements
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _recognizeChord, // Button to trigger chord recognition
              child: Text('Recognize Chord'), // Button label
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The home page is set to ChordHomePage, which is a stateful widget.
// 3. In the ChordHomePage, we have a state variable _recognizedChord to hold the recognized chord.
// 4. The _recognizeChord method calls the recognizeChord method from the flutter_chord package to get the current chord.
// 5. When the button is pressed, _recognizeChord is called, updating the UI with the recognized chord.
// 6. The UI consists of a title, the recognized chord display, and a button to trigger recognition.
```
