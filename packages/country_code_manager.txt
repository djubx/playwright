# Complete Example of Using `country_code_manager`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:country_code_manager/country_code_manager.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Country Code Manager Example',
      home: CountryCodeSelectionScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class CountryCodeSelectionScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CountryCodeSelectionScreenState createState() => _CountryCodeSelectionScreenState();
}

class _CountryCodeSelectionScreenState extends State<CountryCodeSelectionScreen> {
  // Variable to hold the selected country code
  String? selectedCountryCode;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Fetching all country codes
    List<CountryCode> countryCodes = CountryCodeManager.getAllCountryCodes();

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Select Country Code'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: DropdownButton<String>(
          // Displaying the selected country code
          value: selectedCountryCode,
          hint: Text('Select Country Code'),
          items: countryCodes.map((CountryCode country) {
            return DropdownMenuItem<String>(
              value: country.code,
              child: Text('${country.name} (${country.code})'),
            );
          }).toList(),
          onChanged: (String? newValue) {
            // Updating the selected country code
            setState(() {
              selectedCountryCode = newValue;
            });
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The CountryCodeSelectionScreen is displayed, which contains a dropdown for country codes.
// 4. The dropdown is populated with country codes fetched from the CountryCodeManager.
// 5. When a user selects a country code, the selected value is updated in the state, and the UI reflects this change.
