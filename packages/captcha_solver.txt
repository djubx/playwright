<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Captcha Solver Flutter Package

The `captcha_solver` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to automate the solving of CAPTCHAs in mobile applications. CAPTCHAs are commonly used to prevent bots from accessing web services, but they can also hinder user experience in mobile apps. This package provides a solution by integrating CAPTCHA-solving capabilities directly into your Flutter applications.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the `captcha_solver` package in scenarios such as:
- **Automated Testing**: When testing applications that require CAPTCHA verification, this package can help bypass the CAPTCHA during automated tests.
- **User Experience Improvement**: If your app frequently encounters CAPTCHAs that disrupt user flow, integrating this package can streamline the process.
- **Bot Development**: For developers creating bots that need to interact with web services protected by CAPTCHAs, this package can provide a way to automate the solving process.

## Features

- **Multi-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that allows for quick setup and usage.
- **Customizable**: Options to configure the solver based on specific CAPTCHA types.
- **Real-time Solving**: Provides real-time solving capabilities, ensuring minimal disruption to user experience.

With these features, the `captcha_solver` package is an essential tool for developers looking to enhance their applications' functionality and user experience.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Captcha Solver Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `captcha_solver` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `captcha_solver` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  captcha_solver: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Update your `build.gradle` file to include any required dependencies.

### iOS Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Add the following to your `Info.plist` to allow network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. **CocoaPods**: Ensure your iOS project is using the latest version of CocoaPods.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your application.

1. **Import the Package**:

```dart
import 'package:captcha_solver/captcha_solver.dart';
```

2. **Initialize the Solver**:

You can initialize the solver in your main application file or wherever you need to solve a CAPTCHA.

```dart
final captchaSolver = RealFlutter();
```

3. **Solving a CAPTCHA**:

To solve a CAPTCHA, you can use the following method:

```dart
String captchaSolution = await captchaSolver.solveCaptcha(captchaImage);
```

This method takes the CAPTCHA image as input and returns the solved text.

With these steps, you can easily integrate the `captcha_solver` package into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using the Captcha Solver Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:captcha_solver/captcha_solver.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Captcha Solver Example',
      home: CaptchaSolverPage(),
    );
  }
}

class CaptchaSolverPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CaptchaSolverPageState createState() => _CaptchaSolverPageState();
}

class _CaptchaSolverPageState extends State<CaptchaSolverPage> {
  final RealFlutter captchaSolver = RealFlutter(); // Initialize the captcha solver
  String captchaImage = ''; // Placeholder for the CAPTCHA image
  String captchaSolution = ''; // To store the solved CAPTCHA

  // Function to simulate CAPTCHA solving
  Future<void> solveCaptcha() async {
    // Call the solveCaptcha method with the CAPTCHA image
    captchaSolution = await captchaSolver.solveCaptcha(captchaImage);
    setState(() {}); // Update the UI with the solved CAPTCHA
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Captcha Solver Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('CAPTCHA Image: $captchaImage'), // Display the CAPTCHA image
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: solveCaptcha, // Trigger CAPTCHA solving
              child: Text('Solve CAPTCHA'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text('Solved CAPTCHA: $captchaSolution'), // Display the solved CAPTCHA
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The CaptchaSolverPage widget is displayed as the home screen.
// 3. The captchaSolver instance of RealFlutter is created to handle CAPTCHA solving.
// 4. When the "Solve CAPTCHA" button is pressed, the solveCaptcha method is called.
// 5. The solveCaptcha method uses the captchaSolver to solve the CAPTCHA image and updates the UI with the result.
```

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The app initializes and displays the main screen with a button to solve the CAPTCHA.
// 2. When the user presses the button, the app calls the `solveCaptcha` method.
// 3. This method uses the `captcha_solver` package to process the CAPTCHA image and retrieve the solution.
// 4. The solved CAPTCHA is then displayed on the screen, providing feedback to the user.
