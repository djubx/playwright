# Tutorial: Setting Up Mixpanel in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `mixpanel_flutter` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `mixpanel_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  mixpanel_flutter: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Configure for Android

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21  // Mixpanel requires at least API level 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

## Step 3: Configure for iOS

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. Ensure your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Initialize Mixpanel

In your main Dart file, initialize Mixpanel with your project token. You can find your token in your Mixpanel project settings.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mixpanel_flutter/mixpanel_flutter.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  final mixpanel = await Mixpanel.init("YOUR_MIXPANEL_TOKEN", trackAutomaticEvents: true);
  runApp(MyApp(mixpanel: mixpanel));
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  final Mixpanel mixpanel;

  MyApp({required this.mixpanel});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: HomeScreen(mixpanel: mixpanel),
    );
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Track Events

You can now track events in your application. For example, in your `HomeScreen` widget:

```dart
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final Mixpanel mixpanel;

  HomeScreen({required this.mixpanel});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Mixpanel Example")),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            mixpanel.track("Button Clicked", properties: {"button_name": "Example Button"});
          },
          child: Text("Click Me"),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Now, when the button is clicked, the event will be tracked in Mixpanel.

# Complete Example of Mixpanel in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mixpanel_flutter/mixpanel_flutter.dart';

void main() async {
  // Ensure Flutter binding is initialized before using Mixpanel
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  
  // Initialize Mixpanel with your project token
  final mixpanel = await Mixpanel.init("YOUR_MIXPANEL_TOKEN", trackAutomaticEvents: true);
  
  // Run the app and pass the Mixpanel instance
  runApp(MyApp(mixpanel: mixpanel));
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  final Mixpanel mixpanel;

  MyApp({required this.mixpanel});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: HomeScreen(mixpanel: mixpanel),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final Mixpanel mixpanel;

  HomeScreen({required this.mixpanel});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Mixpanel Example")),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Track a button click event with Mixpanel
            mixpanel.track("Button Clicked", properties: {"button_name": "Example Button"});
          },
          child: Text("Click Me"),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app and Mixpanel with the provided token.
// 2. The MyApp widget is created, which takes the Mixpanel instance as a parameter.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is displayed, containing a button.
// 4. When the button is clicked, an event "Button Clicked" is tracked in Mixpanel with a property indicating the button's name.
// 5. This allows you to analyze user interactions and behaviors in your Mixpanel dashboard.
```
