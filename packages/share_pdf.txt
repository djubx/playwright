# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using share_pdf

## Installation
To get started with the `share_pdf` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  share_pdf: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/share_pdf).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Ensure you have the following permissions added:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to request permission for file sharing:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to share PDFs.</string>
```

## Using the Package
To use the `share_pdf` package, you can follow these steps in your Flutter application:

1. Import the package:

```dart
import 'package:share_pdf/share_pdf.dart';
```

2. Create a function to share a PDF file:

```dart
void sharePdf(String filePath) {
  SharePdf.share(filePath);
}
```

3. Call this function when you want to share the PDF, for example, on a button press.

# Complete Example of Using share_pdf

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:share_pdf/share_pdf.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Share PDF Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Share PDF Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Define the path to the PDF file you want to share
              String filePath = '/path/to/your/file.pdf';
              
              // Call the sharePdf function to initiate sharing
              sharePdf(filePath);
            },
            child: Text('Share PDF'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to share the PDF file
  void sharePdf(String filePath) {
    // Use the share_pdf package to share the PDF
    SharePdf.share(filePath);
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'Share PDF Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 5. An ElevatedButton is created, which, when pressed, defines the file path of the PDF to be shared.
// 6. The sharePdf function is called with the specified file path, which uses the share_pdf package to share the PDF.
// 7. The user can now share the PDF through their preferred sharing method.
```

### Summary
In this blog post, we explored the `share_pdf` Flutter package, which provides an easy way to share PDF documents across platforms. We covered the installation process, platform-specific configurations, and provided a complete example of how to implement the package in a Flutter application. The example demonstrated how to set up a simple UI with a button that triggers the sharing of a PDF file. This package is particularly useful for applications that require document sharing capabilities, making it a valuable addition to any Flutter developer's toolkit.
