# Tutorial: Setting Up tbib_file_uploader

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `tbib_file_uploader` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `tbib_file_uploader` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  tbib_file_uploader: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/tbib_file_uploader).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you need to add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file to request permission for accessing files:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to upload files.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to upload files.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio uploads.</string>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage
Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in a Flutter widget.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tbib_file_uploader/tbib_file_uploader.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('File Uploader Example')),
        body: FileUploaderWidget(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class FileUploaderWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _FileUploaderWidgetState createState() => _FileUploaderWidgetState();
}

class _FileUploaderWidgetState extends State<FileUploaderWidget> {
  // This method will be called when the user selects files
  void _uploadFiles() {
    // Logic to handle file selection and upload
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(
      child: ElevatedButton(
        onPressed: _uploadFiles,
        child: Text('Upload Files'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app with a button that triggers the file upload process.

# Complete Example of tbib_file_uploader

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tbib_file_uploader/tbib_file_uploader.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('File Uploader Example')),
        body: FileUploaderWidget(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class FileUploaderWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _FileUploaderWidgetState createState() => _FileUploaderWidgetState();
}

class _FileUploaderWidgetState extends State<FileUploaderWidget> {
  // This variable will hold the selected files
  List<File> _selectedFiles = [];

  // This method will be called when the user selects files
  void _uploadFiles() async {
    // Use the file uploader to select files
    List<File>? files = await FileUploader.pickFiles();
    
    // Check if files were selected
    if (files != null) {
      setState(() {
        _selectedFiles = files; // Update the state with selected files
      });

      // Start the upload process
      for (var file in _selectedFiles) {
        // Simulate file upload
        await FileUploader.uploadFile(file);
      }
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(
      child: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: [
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: _uploadFiles,
            child: Text('Upload Files'),
          ),
          // Display the names of the selected files
          ..._selectedFiles.map((file) => Text(file.path)).toList(),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and the FileUploaderWidget.
// 3. The FileUploaderWidget is a stateful widget that manages the file upload process.
// 4. When the user presses the "Upload Files" button, the _uploadFiles method is called.
// 5. This method uses the FileUploader to allow the user to select files from their device.
// 6. If files are selected, the state is updated to include the selected files.
// 7. The app then simulates the upload of each selected file.
// 8. The names of the selected files are displayed below the button.
