Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your microphone for audio playback.</string>
   <key>NSAppleMusicUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your music library.</string>
   ```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Here’s a simple example of how to initialize and use the `lecle_yoyo_player` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:lecle_yoyo_player/lecle_yoyo_player.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late YoyoPlayer player;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    player = YoyoPlayer();
  }

  void playAudio() {
    player.play('https://www.example.com/audio.mp3');
  }

  void pauseAudio() {
    player.pause();
  }

  void stopAudio() {
    player.stop();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    player.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Audio Player Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(onPressed: playAudio, child: Text('Play')),
            ElevatedButton(onPressed: pauseAudio, child: Text('Pause')),
            ElevatedButton(onPressed: stopAudio, child: Text('Stop')),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple audio player with play, pause, and stop functionalities. The `YoyoPlayer` instance is initialized in the `initState` method, and we provide buttons to control the audio playback.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the `lecle_yoyo_player` package into your Flutter application successfully.

# Complete Example of lecle_yoyo_player

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:lecle_yoyo_player/lecle_yoyo_player.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late YoyoPlayer player; // Declare the YoyoPlayer instance

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    player = YoyoPlayer(); // Initialize the player
  }

  // Function to play audio
  void playAudio() {
    player.play('https://www.example.com/audio.mp3'); // Play audio from the URL
  }

  // Function to pause audio
  void pauseAudio() {
    player.pause(); // Pause the currently playing audio
  }

  // Function to stop audio
  void stopAudio() {
    player.stop(); // Stop the audio playback
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    player.dispose(); // Dispose of the player when the widget is removed
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Audio Player Example')), // App bar title
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(onPressed: playAudio, child: Text('Play')), // Play button
            ElevatedButton(onPressed: pauseAudio, child: Text('Pause')), // Pause button
            ElevatedButton(onPressed: stopAudio, child: Text('Stop')), // Stop button
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget being created.
// 2. In the initState method, an instance of YoyoPlayer is initialized.
// 3. The build method creates a simple UI with three buttons: Play, Pause, and Stop.
// 4. When the Play button is pressed, the playAudio function is called, which plays the audio from the specified URL.
// 5. The Pause button calls the pauseAudio function to pause the playback.
// 6. The Stop button calls the stopAudio function to stop the playback.
// 7. When the widget is disposed, the player is also disposed to free up resources.
