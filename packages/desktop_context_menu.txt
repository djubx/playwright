# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Desktop Context Menu Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `desktop_context_menu` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  desktop_context_menu: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/desktop_context_menu).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### For Windows

1. Ensure that your Flutter project is set up for Windows development.
2. You may need to enable the Windows desktop embedding by running:
   ```bash
   flutter config --enable-windows-desktop
   ```

### For macOS

1. Ensure that your Flutter project is set up for macOS development.
2. You may need to enable the macOS desktop embedding by running:
   ```bash
   flutter config --enable-macos-desktop
   ```

### For Linux

1. Ensure that your Flutter project is set up for Linux development.
2. You may need to enable the Linux desktop embedding by running:
   ```bash
   flutter config --enable-linux-desktop
   ```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

To use the `desktop_context_menu` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:desktop_context_menu/desktop_context_menu.dart';
```

You can then create a context menu by defining the actions you want to include. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
void showContextMenu(BuildContext context) {
  final menu = ContextMenu(
    items: [
      ContextMenuItem(label: 'Action 1', onPressed: () {
        // Handle Action 1
      }),
      ContextMenuItem(label: 'Action 2', onPressed: () {
        // Handle Action 2
      }),
    ],
  );

  menu.show(context);
}
```

You can trigger this context menu on a right-click event on any widget.

## Step 4: Testing Your Application

After implementing the context menu, run your application on the desired platform (Windows, macOS, or Linux) to test the functionality. Ensure that the context menu appears as expected when you right-click on the designated widget.

With these steps, you should be able to successfully integrate and use the `desktop_context_menu` package in your Flutter desktop applications.

# Complete Example of Using the Desktop Context Menu Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:desktop_context_menu/desktop_context_menu.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Desktop Context Menu Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Context Menu Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: GestureDetector(
            // Detect right-click
            onSecondaryTap: () {
              showContextMenu(context);
            },
            child: Container(
              padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
              color: Colors.blueAccent,
              child: Text(
                'Right-click me!',
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to show the context menu
  void showContextMenu(BuildContext context) {
    final menu = ContextMenu(
      items: [
        ContextMenuItem(label: 'Action 1', onPressed: () {
          // Handle Action 1
          print('Action 1 selected');
        }),
        ContextMenuItem(label: 'Action 2', onPressed: () {
          // Handle Action 2
          print('Action 2 selected');
        }),
      ],
    );

    // Show the context menu at the current position
    menu.show(context);
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a simple Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, a GestureDetector is used to detect right-clicks (secondary taps).
// 4. When the user right-clicks on the blue container, the showContextMenu() function is called.
// 5. The showContextMenu() function creates a ContextMenu with two items: Action 1 and Action 2.
// 6. Each action has an onPressed callback that prints a message to the console when selected.
// 7. The context menu is displayed at the current position of the mouse cursor.
```
