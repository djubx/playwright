# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using barcode_scan2

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `barcode_scan2` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  barcode_scan2: ^4.1.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open `AndroidManifest.xml` located in `android/app/src/main/` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
   ```

2. **Minimum SDK Version**: Ensure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open `Info.plist` located in `ios/Runner/` and add the following key to request camera access:

   ```xml
   <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to the camera to scan barcodes.</string>
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement barcode scanning.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:barcode_scan2/barcode_scan2.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Barcode Scanner')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              var result = await BarcodeScanner.scan();
              // Display the scanned result
              showDialog(
                context: context,
                builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                  title: Text('Scan Result'),
                  content: Text(result.rawContent),
                  actions: [
                    TextButton(
                      onPressed: () => Navigator.pop(context),
                      child: Text('OK'),
                    ),
                  ],
                ),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Scan Barcode'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, when the user taps the "Scan Barcode" button, the camera opens, allowing them to scan a barcode. The scanned result is then displayed in a dialog.

# Complete Example of barcode_scan2 in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:barcode_scan2/barcode_scan2.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Barcode Scanner')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initiate the barcode scan
              var result = await BarcodeScanner.scan();
              
              // Show the scanned result in a dialog
              showDialog(
                context: context,
                builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                  title: Text('Scan Result'),
                  content: Text(result.rawContent), // Display the scanned content
                  actions: [
                    TextButton(
                      onPressed: () => Navigator.pop(context), // Close the dialog
                      child: Text('OK'),
                    ),
                  ],
                ),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Scan Barcode'), // Button to trigger scanning
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the application
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the BarcodeScanner.scan() method is called to open the camera for scanning.
// 5. Once a barcode is scanned, the result is captured and displayed in an AlertDialog.
// 6. The user can close the dialog by pressing the 'OK' button, which calls Navigator.pop(context).
