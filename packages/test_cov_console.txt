# test_cov_console Flutter Package

The `test_cov_console` package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers to facilitate the testing of applications by providing a console interface for displaying test coverage results. This package is particularly useful for developers who want to ensure their code is well-tested and maintainable. 

## When to Use

You should consider using the `test_cov_console` package when:
- You are developing a Flutter application and want to monitor your test coverage.
- You need a simple way to visualize test results in the console.
- You want to integrate test coverage reporting into your CI/CD pipeline.

## Features

- **Console Output**: Displays test coverage results directly in the console, making it easy to see which parts of your code are covered by tests.
- **Integration with Flutter Test**: Seamlessly integrates with the Flutter testing framework, allowing you to run tests and view coverage in one command.
- **Customizable Output**: You can customize the output format to suit your needs, making it easier to read and understand.

By using the `test_cov_console` package, you can enhance your testing workflow and ensure that your Flutter applications maintain high code quality.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using test_cov_console

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `test_cov_console` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter projects.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `test_cov_console` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  test_cov_console: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    testOptions {
        unitTests.all {
            useJUnitPlatform()
        }
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to ensure that your project is set up to run tests correctly. Open your `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode and ensure that your test targets are configured properly.

## Step 3: Using test_cov_console

To use the `test_cov_console` package, you can run your tests with coverage enabled. Use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
flutter test --coverage
```

This command will run your tests and generate a coverage report. The `test_cov_console` package will display the results in the console, allowing you to see which parts of your code are covered by tests.

## Step 4: Customizing Output

You can customize the output format by modifying the configuration in your test files. For example, you can specify the level of detail you want in the coverage report.

```dart
import 'package:test_cov_console/test_cov_console.dart';

void main() {
  // Configure the console output
  TestCovConsole.configure(
    showDetailedCoverage: true, // Show detailed coverage information
  );

  // Run your tests here
}
```

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the `test_cov_console` package effectively in your Flutter projects.

# Complete Example of Using test_cov_console

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:test_cov_console/test_cov_console.dart';

void main() {
  // Configure the console output for test coverage
  TestCovConsole.configure(
    showDetailedCoverage: true, // Enable detailed coverage output
  );

  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Test Coverage Console Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Test Coverage Console Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Trigger a test coverage report
              TestCovConsole.reportCoverage();
            },
            child: Text('Run Tests and Show Coverage'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application and configures the test coverage console.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which sets up a MaterialApp with a title.
// 3. The home of the MaterialApp is a Scaffold that contains an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, there is an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, it triggers the reportCoverage method from the TestCovConsole class.
// 6. This method runs the tests and displays the coverage results in the console, allowing developers to see which parts of the code are covered by tests.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In summary, the `test_cov_console` package provides a straightforward way to monitor test coverage in Flutter applications. By following the setup and usage instructions, you can easily integrate this package into your development workflow, ensuring that your code remains well-tested and maintainable.
