# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Native Shutter Sound Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the `native_shutter_sound` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  native_shutter_sound: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file. Add the following lines within the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you need to add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file to request camera access:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to take photos.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save photos.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the native shutter sound when taking a photo.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:native_shutter_sound/native_shutter_sound.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Native Shutter Sound Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Play the native shutter sound
              await NativeShutterSound.play();
            },
            child: Text('Take Photo'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, when the user presses the "Take Photo" button, the native shutter sound will play, simulating the action of taking a photo.

# Complete Example of Using Native Shutter Sound

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:native_shutter_sound/native_shutter_sound.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Native Shutter Sound Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Play the native shutter sound when the button is pressed
              await NativeShutterSound.play();
            },
            child: Text('Take Photo'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Native Shutter Sound Example'.
// 4. In the body of the Scaffold, a Center widget is used to center the content.
// 5. An ElevatedButton is created with the text 'Take Photo'.
// 6. When the button is pressed, the onPressed callback is triggered.
// 7. Inside the callback, the NativeShutterSound.play() method is called to play the native shutter sound.
// 8. This simulates the action of taking a photo, providing auditory feedback to the user.
