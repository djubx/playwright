# Tutorial: Using the Count Down Time Flutter Package
=====================================================

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

Add the `count_down_time` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  count_down_time: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:count_down_time/count_down_time.dart';
```

### Step 3: Create a CountDownTime Widget

Create a `CountDownTime` widget and pass the desired duration:

```dart
CountDownTime(
  duration: Duration(hours: 1, minutes: 30, seconds: 0),
  onFinish: () {
    print('Timer finished!');
  },
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details

*   Android: No additional configuration is required.
*   iOS: No additional configuration is required.

### Optimizations

*   To improve performance, consider using a `const` constructor for the `CountDownTime` widget.
*   If you need to display a timer with a custom format, use the `format` property.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:count_down_time/count_down_time.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Count Down Time Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: CountDownTime(
            // Set the duration to 1 hour, 30 minutes, and 0 seconds
            duration: Duration(hours: 1, minutes: 30, seconds: 0),
            // Set the timer format to HH:MM:SS
            format: 'HH:MM:SS',
            // Set the finish callback
            onFinish: () {
              print('Timer finished!');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow:
// 1. The user runs the app, and the RealFlutter widget is created.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds the MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with a title and a Center widget.
// 4. The Center widget contains the CountDownTime widget.
// 5. The CountDownTime widget displays the countdown timer with the specified duration and format.
// 6. When the timer expires, the onFinish callback is called, printing 'Timer finished!' to the console.
