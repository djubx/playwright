# Tutorial: Setting Up form_builder_image_picker

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the `form_builder_image_picker` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  form_builder_image_picker: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/form_builder_image_picker).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys for camera and photo library access:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to take pictures.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to upload images.</string>
```

## Step 3: Import the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:form_builder_image_picker/form_builder_image_picker.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Image Picker
You can now use the `FormBuilderImagePicker` widget in your forms. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
FormBuilderImagePicker(
  name: 'images',
  decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Select Images'),
  maxImages: 5, // Limit the number of images
  onChanged: (value) {
    // Handle the selected images
    print(value);
  },
),
```

This widget will display an image picker that allows users to select images from their gallery or take new photos.

With these steps, you are now ready to integrate the `form_builder_image_picker` into your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Using form_builder_image_picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_form_builder/flutter_form_builder.dart';
import 'package:form_builder_image_picker/form_builder_image_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Image Picker Example',
      home: ImagePickerForm(),
    );
  }
}

class ImagePickerForm extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ImagePickerFormState createState() => _ImagePickerFormState();
}

class _ImagePickerFormState extends State<ImagePickerForm> {
  final _formKey = GlobalKey<FormBuilderState>();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Image Picker Form'),
      ),
      body: FormBuilder(
        key: _formKey,
        child: Column(
          children: [
            // Image Picker Field
            FormBuilderImagePicker(
              name: 'images',
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Select Images'),
              maxImages: 5, // Limit the number of images
              onChanged: (value) {
                // Handle the selected images
                print(value);
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Validate and save the form
                if (_formKey.currentState?.saveAndValidate() ?? false) {
                  // Process the images
                  final images = _formKey.currentState?.fields['images']?.value;
                  print('Selected images: $images');
                } else {
                  print('Validation failed');
                }
              },
              child: Text('Submit'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The ImagePickerForm widget is displayed, containing a FormBuilder.
// 3. The FormBuilderImagePicker widget allows users to select images.
// 4. When the user presses the Submit button, the form is validated.
