import 'package:ming_cute_icons/ming_cute_icons.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override

          backgroundColor: Colors.pink,
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying a cute icon from the ming_cute_icons package
              Icon(
                MingCuteIcons.cute_icon_name, // Replace with the actual icon name

              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Add space between the icon and text
              Text(
                'Hello, Flutter!',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.black),

            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The above code creates a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the ming_cute_icons package.
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The AppBar displays a title and has a pink background.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child widgets.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the icon and text vertically.
// 6. An Icon widget displays a cute icon from the ming_cute_icons package, with a specified size and color.
// 7. A SizedBox is used to add space between the icon and the text below it.
// 8. Finally, a Text widget displays a greeting message below the icon.
