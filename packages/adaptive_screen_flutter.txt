# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using adaptive_screen_flutter

## Installation
To get started with the `adaptive_screen_flutter` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  adaptive_screen_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/adaptive_screen_flutter).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package
To use the `adaptive_screen_flutter` package, you can wrap your main widget with `AdaptiveScreen` and define your adaptive layouts based on the screen size. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:adaptive_screen_flutter/adaptive_screen_flutter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return AdaptiveScreen(
      builder: (context, screenSize) {
        // Check the screen size and return different layouts
        if (screenSize.isSmall) {
          return Scaffold(
            appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Small Screen')),
            body: Center(child: Text('This is a small screen layout')),
          );
        } else {
          return Scaffold(
            appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Large Screen')),
            body: Center(child: Text('This is a large screen layout')),
          );
        }
      },
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `AdaptiveScreen` widget checks the screen size and returns different layouts for small and large screens.

# Complete Example of adaptive_screen_flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:adaptive_screen_flutter/adaptive_screen_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Adaptive Screen Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return AdaptiveScreen(
      builder: (context, screenSize) {
        // Check if the screen size is small
        if (screenSize.isSmall) {
          return Scaffold(
            appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Small Screen')),
            body: Center(
              child: Column(
                mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
                children: <Widget>[
                  Text('This is a small screen layout'),
                  ElevatedButton(
                    onPressed: () {
                      // Action for small screen
                    },
                    child: Text('Small Screen Action'),
                  ),
                ],
              ),
            ),
          );
        } else {
          // If the screen size is large
          return Scaffold(
            appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Large Screen')),
            body: Center(
              child: Row(
                mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
                children: <Widget>[
                  Text('This is a large screen layout'),
                  SizedBox(width: 20),
                  ElevatedButton(
                    onPressed: () {
                      // Action for large screen
                    },
                    child: Text('Large Screen Action'),
                  ),
                ],
              ),
            ),
          );
        }
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter uses AdaptiveScreen to determine the screen size.
// 4. If the screen is small, it displays a simple layout with a button.
// 5. If the screen is large, it displays a more complex layout with a row of widgets.
// 6. Each layout has a button that can trigger specific actions based on the screen size.
