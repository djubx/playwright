# Tutorial

## Setup Process

To get started with the `file_picker_writable` package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  file_picker_writable: ^latest_version
```

Replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/file_picker_writable).

### Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

#### iOS

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request permission for file access:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to select files.</string>
<key>NSDocumentsFolderUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your documents to select files.</string>
```

### Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:file_picker_writable/file_picker_writable.dart';
```

## Using the Package

### Basic Usage Example

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the `file_picker_writable` package to pick a file and write to it:

```dart
void pickAndWriteFile() async {
  // Open the file picker
  FilePickerResult? result = await FilePicker.platform.pickFiles(
    allowMultiple: false,
    type: FileType.any,
  );

  // Check if a file was selected
  if (result != null) {
    // Get the file path
    String filePath = result.files.single.path!;
    
    // Write to the file
    final file = File(filePath);
    await file.writeAsString('Hello, this is a test write!');
  }
}
```

This function allows users to pick a file and write a string to it. You can expand this functionality based on your app's requirements.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:file_picker_writable/file_picker_writable.dart';
import 'dart:io';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'File Picker Writable Example',
      home: FilePickerExample(),
    );
  }
}

class FilePickerExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _FilePickerExampleState createState() => _FilePickerExampleState();
}

class _FilePickerExampleState extends State<FilePickerExample> {
  String _filePath = '';

  // Function to pick and write to a file
  void pickAndWriteFile() async {
    // Open the file picker
    FilePickerResult? result = await FilePicker.platform.pickFiles(
      allowMultiple: false,
      type: FileType.any,
    );

    // Check if a file was selected
    if (result != null) {
      // Get the file path
      String filePath = result.files.single.path!;
      setState(() {
        _filePath = filePath; // Update the state with the selected file path
      });

      // Write to the file
      final file = File(filePath);
      await file.writeAsString('Hello, this is a test write!'); // Write a test string to the file
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('File Picker Writable Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Selected File: $_filePath'), // Display the selected file path
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: pickAndWriteFile, // Call the function to pick and write a file
              child: Text('Pick and Write File'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget (FilePickerExample).
// 3. FilePickerExample is a stateful widget that maintains the selected file path.
// 4. The pickAndWriteFile function is triggered when the button is pressed.
// 5. The file picker opens, allowing the user to select a file.
// 6. If a file is selected, its path is stored in the state and displayed on the screen.
// 7. The app then writes a test string to the selected file, demonstrating the writable feature.
```
