# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Crimson Package

## Step 1: Adding Crimson to Your Project

To get started with the Crimson package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  crimson: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21  // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # Ensure this is set to at least 10.0
```

## Step 3: Using Crimson in Your Application

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use a custom button from the Crimson package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:crimson/crimson.dart'; // Import the crimson package

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Crimson Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Crimson Package Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: CrimsonButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Action when button is pressed
              print('Crimson Button Pressed!');
            },
            child: Text('Press Me'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that uses a button from the Crimson package. The button prints a message to the console when pressed.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and start using the Crimson package in your Flutter applications effectively.

# Complete Example of a Flutter Application Using Crimson

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:crimson/crimson.dart'; // Import the crimson package

// Main class of the application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Crimson Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Crimson Package Example'), // Title of the app
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: CrimsonButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Action when button is pressed
              print('Crimson Button Pressed!'); // Log message to console
            },
            child: Text('Press Me'), // Text displayed on the button
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp, which is the root of the application.
3. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold widget is created, providing a structure for the app with an AppBar and a body.
4. The AppBar displays the title "Crimson Package Example".
5. The body contains a Center widget that centers its child, which is a CrimsonButton.
6. When the CrimsonButton is pressed, it triggers the onPressed callback, printing "Crimson Button Pressed!" to the console.
7. This simple flow demonstrates how to integrate and use the Crimson package within a Flutter application.
