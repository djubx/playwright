# Advanced Navigator: A Comprehensive Overview

The `advanced_navigator` Flutter package is designed to enhance navigation within Flutter applications by providing a more flexible and powerful navigation system. It allows developers to manage complex navigation scenarios with ease, making it ideal for applications that require deep linking, nested navigation, or dynamic route management.

## When to Use `advanced_navigator`

- **Complex Navigation Flows**: If your app has multiple layers of navigation or requires deep linking, this package simplifies the process.
- **Dynamic Routing**: When you need to generate routes dynamically based on user input or other conditions.
- **State Management**: It integrates well with state management solutions, allowing for a more cohesive navigation experience.

## Key Features

- **Nested Navigation**: Supports nested navigators, enabling complex UI structures.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Create routes dynamically based on application state or user actions.
- **Deep Linking**: Easily handle deep links to navigate to specific screens within your app.
- **Custom Transition Animations**: Define custom animations for route transitions to enhance user experience.

Overall, `advanced_navigator` is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to implement sophisticated navigation patterns in their applications.

# Setting Up and Using Advanced Navigator

## Installation

To add the `advanced_navigator` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  advanced_navigator: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/advanced_navigator).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions for deep linking if you plan to use that feature. Add the following intent filter within the `<activity>` tag:

```xml
<intent-filter>
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
    <data android:scheme="your_scheme" android:host="your_host" />
</intent-filter>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` to handle deep links. Add the following:

```xml
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
    <dict>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
        <array>
            <string>your_scheme</string>
        </array>
    </dict>
</array>
```

## Basic Usage

To use the `advanced_navigator`, you need to set up your main application widget to utilize the `AdvancedNavigator` class. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:advanced_navigator/advanced_navigator.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      navigatorKey: AdvancedNavigator.navigatorKey,
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we set up the `AdvancedNavigator` with a global navigator key, allowing us to manage navigation from anywhere in the app.

# Complete Example of Advanced Navigator

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:advanced_navigator/advanced_navigator.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      navigatorKey: AdvancedNavigator.navigatorKey, // Set the navigator key
      home: HomeScreen(), // Start with the HomeScreen
    );
  }
}

// HomeScreen widget
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home Screen')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate to DetailScreen when button is pressed
            AdvancedNavigator.push(DetailScreen());
          },
          child: Text('Go to Detail Screen'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// DetailScreen widget
class DetailScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Detail Screen')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate back to HomeScreen
            AdvancedNavigator.pop();
          },
          child: Text('Back to Home Screen'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
2. The HomeScreen is displayed as the initial screen.
3. When the user presses the button on the HomeScreen, the AdvancedNavigator pushes the DetailScreen onto the navigation stack.
4. The DetailScreen is displayed, and it has a button to navigate back.
5. Pressing the back button on the DetailScreen calls AdvancedNavigator.pop(), which removes the DetailScreen from the stack and returns to the HomeScreen.

### Summary of the Code Flow
The application begins with the `RealFlutter` widget, which initializes the `MaterialApp` and sets the `HomeScreen` as the starting point. The `HomeScreen` contains a button that, when pressed, uses the `AdvancedNavigator` to push the `DetailScreen` onto the navigation stack. The `DetailScreen` also has a button that allows the user to navigate back to the `HomeScreen` by calling `AdvancedNavigator.pop()`. This flow demonstrates the basic navigation capabilities provided by the `advanced_navigator` package, showcasing its ease of use and flexibility in managing navigation states.
