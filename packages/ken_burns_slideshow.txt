```yaml
dependencies:
  ken_burns_slideshow: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package
To use the **ken_burns_slideshow** package, you can create a simple widget that utilizes the `KenBurnsSlideshow` class. Below is a basic example of how to implement it in your Flutter application.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ken_burns_slideshow/ken_burns_slideshow.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Ken Burns Slideshow Example')),
      body: KenBurnsSlideshow(
        images: [
          NetworkImage('https://example.com/image1.jpg'),
          NetworkImage('https://example.com/image2.jpg'),
          NetworkImage('https://example.com/image3.jpg'),
        ],
        duration: Duration(seconds: 5), // Duration for each image
        allowZoom: true, // Allow zooming in on images
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple `Scaffold` with an `AppBar` and a `KenBurnsSlideshow` widget that displays three images from the network. The slideshow will automatically transition between images every 5 seconds.

# Complete Example of Ken Burns Slideshow

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ken_burns_slideshow/ken_burns_slideshow.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Ken Burns Slideshow Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Ken Burns Slideshow Example')),
      body: KenBurnsSlideshow(
        images: [
          NetworkImage('https://example.com/image1.jpg'), // First image
          NetworkImage('https://example.com/image2.jpg'), // Second image
          NetworkImage('https://example.com/image3.jpg'), // Third image
        ],
        duration: Duration(seconds: 5), // Duration for each image
        allowZoom: true, // Allow zooming in on images
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and home.
// 3. The home of the MaterialApp is set to RealFlutter, which is another StatelessWidget.
// 4. In RealFlutter, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a body.
// 5. The body contains the KenBurnsSlideshow widget, which takes a list of images and a duration.
// 6. The slideshow will automatically transition between the images every 5 seconds, creating a Ken Burns effect.
// 7. The allowZoom property enables zooming in on the images for a more interactive experience.
