# Setup and Usage of flutter_prince_of_versions

## Installation
To add the `flutter_prince_of_versions` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_prince_of_versions: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run the following command to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. The package works out of the box.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your `Info.plist` file contains the necessary versioning information. Typically, this is already set up when you create a new Flutter project.

## Basic Usage
To use the package, import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_prince_of_versions/flutter_prince_of_versions.dart';
```

You can then create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class to access version information.

### Example Usage
```dart
void main() {
  RealFlutter realFlutter = RealFlutter();
  String currentVersion = realFlutter.getCurrentVersion();
  print("Current App Version: $currentVersion");
}
```

This will print the current version of your app to the console.

# Complete Example of flutter_prince_of_versions

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_prince_of_versions/flutter_prince_of_versions.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Version Example',
      home: VersionDisplayScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class VersionDisplayScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create an instance of RealFlutter to access version information
    RealFlutter realFlutter = RealFlutter();
    
    // Get the current version of the app
    String currentVersion = realFlutter.getCurrentVersion();
    
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('App Version Display'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Current App Version: $currentVersion',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The VersionDisplayScreen widget is created, which is responsible for displaying the app version.
// 4. Inside VersionDisplayScreen, an instance of RealFlutter is created to access version information.
// 5. The current version is retrieved using getCurrentVersion() and displayed in the center of the screen.
// 6. The app bar shows the title "App Version Display", and the body contains the current version text.
