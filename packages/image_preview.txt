# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Image Preview Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the **image_preview** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  image_preview: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/image_preview).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to access the internet if you are loading images from a URL:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `Info.plist` to allow for network requests:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage
Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the image preview feature.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:image_preview/image_preview.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Image Preview Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Trigger the image preview
              showImagePreview(context, 'https://example.com/image.jpg');
            },
            child: Text('Preview Image'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void showImagePreview(BuildContext context, String imageUrl) {
    // Use the image preview package to show the image
    showDialog(
      context: context,
      builder: (context) {
        return ImagePreview(
          imageUrl: imageUrl,
          // Optional: Customize the UI
          backgroundColor: Colors.black54,
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, when the user taps the "Preview Image" button, a dialog will open displaying the image in full-screen mode.

# Complete Example of Image Preview in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:image_preview/image_preview.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Image Preview Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Trigger the image preview when the button is pressed
              showImagePreview(context, 'https://example.com/image.jpg');
            },
            child: Text('Preview Image'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void showImagePreview(BuildContext context, String imageUrl) {
    // Use the image preview package to show the image
    showDialog(
      context: context,
      builder: (context) {
        return ImagePreview(
          imageUrl: imageUrl,
          // Optional: Customize the UI
          backgroundColor: Colors.black54,
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. In the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the showImagePreview function is called with the context and the image URL.
// 5. The showImagePreview function displays a dialog using the ImagePreview widget from the image_preview package.
// 6. The ImagePreview widget takes the image URL and displays it in full-screen mode with zoom and pan capabilities.
```
