# Tutorial: Setting Up TelemetryDeckSDK

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `telemetrydecksdk` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `telemetrydecksdk` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  telemetrydecksdk: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open the `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

3. Add the necessary permissions in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file if required by the SDK.

### iOS Configuration
1. Open the `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add any required permissions or configurations as specified in the package documentation.

## Step 3: Initializing the SDK
In your main application file, initialize the `telemetrydecksdk` package. You can do this in the `main()` function:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:telemetrydecksdk/telemetrydecksdk.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the TelemetryDeck SDK
  TelemetryDeckSDK.initialize(apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY');
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 4: Using the SDK
You can now start tracking events and metrics. For example, to track a user interaction:

```dart
TelemetryDeckSDK.trackEvent('button_clicked', {'button_name': 'submit'});
```

This will send an event to the TelemetryDeck service, allowing you to analyze user interactions.

With these steps, you have successfully set up the `telemetrydecksdk` package in your Flutter application. You can now start collecting telemetry data to enhance your app's performance and user experience.

# Complete Example of TelemetryDeckSDK in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:telemetrydecksdk/telemetrydecksdk.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the TelemetryDeck SDK with your API key
  TelemetryDeckSDK.initialize(apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY');
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'TelemetryDeck Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('TelemetryDeck Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Track button click event
            TelemetryDeckSDK.trackEvent('button_clicked', {'button_name': 'submit'});
            // Show a snackbar to confirm the action
            ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
              SnackBar(content: Text('Button Clicked!')),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Click Me'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the TelemetryDeck SDK with an API key.
// 2. The MyApp widget is created, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is displayed as the home screen of the app.
// 4. The HomeScreen contains a button that, when clicked, tracks an event using the TelemetryDeck SDK.
// 5. A snackbar is shown to provide feedback to the user after the button is clicked.
```

In this example, we have created a simple Flutter application that integrates the `telemetrydecksdk` package. The application initializes the SDK, displays a button, and tracks an event when the button is clicked. The comments within the code explain the flow of the application step-by-step, providing clarity on how the `telemetrydecksdk` package is utilized. 

By following this guide, developers can effectively implement telemetry tracking in their Flutter applications, leading to better insights and improved user experiences.
