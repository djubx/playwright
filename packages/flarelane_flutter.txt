# Setting Up flarelane_flutter

To get started with the `flarelane_flutter` package, follow these steps:

## Installation

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `flarelane_flutter` package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     flarelane_flutter: ^latest_version
   ```

   Replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flarelane_flutter).

2. **Install Packages**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

- Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS

- For iOS, make sure to enable the necessary permissions in your `Info.plist` if your animations require any specific capabilities.

## Basic Usage

To use the `flarelane_flutter` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flarelane_flutter/flarelane_flutter.dart';
```

You can then create a `RealFlutter` widget to display your Flare animation. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
RealFlutter(
  animation: 'assets/your_animation.flr',
)
```

This will load and display the specified Flare animation in your Flutter app.

# Complete Example of flarelane_flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flarelane_flutter/flarelane_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flare Lane Example',
      home: RealFlutter(), // Entry point of the app
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to control the animation state
  bool _isPlaying = false;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flare Animation Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Flare animation widget
            FlareActor(
              'assets/your_animation.flr', // Path to your Flare animation file
              animation: _isPlaying ? 'play' : 'idle', // Animation to play based on state
              fit: BoxFit.contain,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Toggle animation state on button press
                setState(() {
                  _isPlaying = !_isPlaying; // Change animation state
                });
              },
              child: Text(_isPlaying ? 'Stop Animation' : 'Play Animation'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The home of the app is set to RealFlutter, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 3. Inside RealFlutter, we have a FlareActor that displays the animation.
// 4. The animation changes based on the _isPlaying state variable.
// 5. An ElevatedButton is provided to toggle the animation state.
// 6. When the button is pressed, the setState method is called, which updates the UI and plays/stops the animation accordingly.
```
