   ```dart
   class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
     @override
     _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
   }

   class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
     JalaliDateTime? selectedDate;

     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return Scaffold(
         appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Jalali Date Picker Example')),
         body: Center(
           child: Column(
             mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
             children: [
               Text(
                 selectedDate != null
                     ? 'Selected Date: ${selectedDate!.toString()}'
                     : 'No Date Selected',
               ),
               ElevatedButton(
                 onPressed: () async {
                   // Show the Jalali date picker
                   final date = await showJalaliDatePicker(
                     context: context,
                     initialDate: selectedDate ?? JalaliDateTime.now(),
                   );
                   if (date != null) {
                     setState(() {
                       selectedDate = date; // Update the selected date
                     });
                   }
                 },
                 child: Text('Pick a Date'),
               ),
             ],
           ),
         ),
       );
     }
   }
   ```

# Complete Example of jalali_flutter_datepicker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:jalali_flutter_datepicker/jalali_flutter_datepicker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Jalali Date Picker Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  JalaliDateTime? selectedDate; // Variable to hold the selected date

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Jalali Date Picker Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the selected date or a message if no date is selected
            Text(
              selectedDate != null
                  ? 'Selected Date: ${selectedDate!.toString()}'
                  : 'No Date Selected',
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () async {
                // Show the Jalali date picker when the button is pressed
                final date = await showJalaliDatePicker(
                  context: context,
                  initialDate: selectedDate ?? JalaliDateTime.now(),
                );
                if (date != null) {
                  setState(() {
                    selectedDate = date; // Update the selected date
                  });
                }
              },
              child: Text('Pick a Date'), // Button text
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme, and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter is a stateful widget that maintains the selected date.
// 4. In the build method, it displays the selected date or a message if no date is selected.
// 5. When the "Pick a Date" button is pressed, the Jalali date picker is shown.
// 6. If a date is selected, the state is updated, and the selected date is displayed on the screen.
