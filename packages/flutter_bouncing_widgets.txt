# Tutorial: Setting Up flutter_bouncing_widgets

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `flutter_bouncing_widgets` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_bouncing_widgets: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the package to start using it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_bouncing_widgets/flutter_bouncing_widgets.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using Bouncing Widgets

You can now use the bouncing widgets in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a bouncing button:

```dart
BouncingButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // Action to perform on button press
  },
  child: Text('Click Me!'),
)
```

This button will exhibit a bouncing effect when pressed, providing immediate feedback to the user.

With these steps, you are now ready to integrate `flutter_bouncing_widgets` into your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of flutter_bouncing_widgets

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_bouncing_widgets/flutter_bouncing_widgets.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Bouncing Widgets Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Bouncing Widgets Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Bouncing Button
              BouncingButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Action to perform on button press
                  print('Bouncing Button Pressed!');
                },
                child: Text('Bouncing Button'),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between buttons
              // Bouncing Image
              BouncingImage(
                image: NetworkImage('https://example.com/image.png'),
                onTap: () {
                  // Action to perform on image tap
                  print('Bouncing Image Tapped!');
                },
                width: 100,
                height: 100,
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that centers its child widgets.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the BouncingButton and BouncingImage vertically.
// 5. The BouncingButton widget is created with an onPressed callback that prints a message to the console when pressed.
// 6. A SizedBox is used to add space between the button and the image.
// 7. The BouncingImage widget displays an image from a network source and has an onTap callback that prints a message when tapped.
// 8. The app demonstrates the bouncing effect on both the button and the image, providing visual feedback to the user.
