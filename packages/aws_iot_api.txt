# AWS IoT API Flutter Package

The `aws_iot_api` Flutter package is a powerful tool that allows developers to integrate AWS IoT services into their Flutter applications. This package provides a seamless way to connect, manage, and interact with IoT devices using AWS's robust infrastructure. 

## When to Use This Package
You should consider using the `aws_iot_api` package when:
- You are developing applications that require real-time communication with IoT devices.
- You need to manage device states, send commands, or receive telemetry data from devices.
- Your application requires secure communication with AWS IoT services.

## Features
- **Real-time Communication**: Supports MQTT protocol for real-time messaging between devices and applications.
- **Device Management**: Easily manage and monitor connected devices.
- **Security**: Utilizes AWS's security features, including authentication and encryption.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS, making it suitable for mobile applications.

The `aws_iot_api` package is essential for developers looking to build robust IoT applications with Flutter, leveraging the power of AWS.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the AWS IoT API Flutter Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the `aws_iot_api` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  aws_iot_api: ^latest_version
```

Replace `latest_version` with the current version of the package.

## Step 2: Configure AWS IoT
Before using the package, you need to set up AWS IoT:
1. **Create an AWS Account**: If you don’t have one, create an account at [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).
2. **Create an IoT Thing**: In the AWS IoT console, create a new IoT Thing.
3. **Generate Certificates**: Generate and download the security certificates for your IoT Thing.
4. **Attach Policies**: Attach an IoT policy to your Thing that allows it to connect and publish/subscribe to topics.

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // or higher
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Initialize the Package
In your Flutter application, initialize the `aws_iot_api` package in your main file:

```dart
import 'package:aws_iot_api/aws_iot_api.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 5: Using the Package
You can now use the package to connect to AWS IoT and interact with your devices. Here’s a simple example of how to connect and publish a message.

# Complete Example of Using the AWS IoT API Flutter Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:aws_iot_api/aws_iot_api.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Create an instance of the AWS IoT client
  final AwsIotApi iotApi = AwsIotApi(
    region: 'your-region', // e.g., 'us-west-2'
    accessKey: 'your-access-key',
    secretKey: 'your-secret-key',
  );

  // MQTT client for communication
  late MqttClient client;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the MQTT client
    client = MqttClient(
      host: 'your-iot-endpoint', // e.g., 'your-iot-endpoint.amazonaws.com'
      clientId: 'your-client-id',
    );

    // Connect to the MQTT broker
    connect();
  }

  // Function to connect to the MQTT broker
  void connect() async {
    try {
      await client.connect();
      print('Connected to AWS IoT');
      // Subscribe to a topic
      client.subscribe('your/topic', MqttQos.atLeastOnce);
      // Publish a message
      client.publish('your/topic', 'Hello from Flutter!');
    } catch (e) {
      print('Connection failed: $e');
    }
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Disconnect the client when the widget is disposed
    client.disconnect();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('AWS IoT API Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Check your AWS IoT console for messages!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts and the main widget `RealFlutter` is created.
// 2. In the `initState` method, an instance of `MqttClient` is created with the AWS IoT endpoint and client ID.
// 3. The `connect` method is called to establish a connection to the AWS IoT broker.
// 4. Upon successful connection, the client subscribes to a specified topic and publishes a message.
// 5. The application displays a simple UI with a message indicating that the user should check the AWS IoT console for messages.
// 6. When the widget is disposed, the MQTT client disconnects to clean up resources.
