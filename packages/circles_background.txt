# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Circles Background

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **circles_background** package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **circles_background** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  circles_background: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the **circles_background** in your app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:circles_background/circles_background.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: CirclesBackground(
        // Define the colors for the circles
        colors: [
          Colors.red,
          Colors.blue,
          Colors.green,
          Colors.yellow,
        ],
        // Define the size of the circles
        sizes: [
          100.0,
          150.0,
          200.0,
          250.0,
        ],
        // Optional: Enable animation
        animated: true,
        // Child widget to overlay on the background
        child: Center(
          child: Text(
            'Welcome to RealFlutter!',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.white),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that uses the **circles_background** package to display a colorful circle background with a welcome message.

# Complete Example of Circles Background

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:circles_background/circles_background.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Circles Background Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: CirclesBackground(
        // Define the colors for the circles
        colors: [
          Colors.red, // First circle color
          Colors.blue, // Second circle color
          Colors.green, // Third circle color
          Colors.yellow, // Fourth circle color
        ],
        // Define the size of the circles
        sizes: [
          100.0, // Size of the first circle
          150.0, // Size of the second circle
          200.0, // Size of the third circle
          250.0, // Size of the fourth circle
        ],
        // Optional: Enable animation for the circles
        animated: true,
        // Child widget to overlay on the background
        child: Center(
          child: Text(
            'Welcome to RealFlutter!', // Text displayed on the screen
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.white), // Text style
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and home property.
// 3. The home property is set to RealFlutter, which is another StatelessWidget.
// 4. In RealFlutter, we create a Scaffold widget that serves as the basic structure of the app.
// 5. Inside the Scaffold, we use the CirclesBackground widget to create a colorful background.
// 6. We define the colors and sizes of the circles, and enable animation for a dynamic effect.
// 7. The child of CirclesBackground is a Center widget that contains a Text widget displaying a welcome message.
// 8. The text is styled to be large and white, making it stand out against the colorful background.
```
