```

3. Make sure to include your Google Maps API key as well:

```xml
<key>GMSApiKey</key>
<string>YOUR_API_KEY</string>
```

## Using the Package
Once you have completed the installation and configuration, you can start using the `map_autocomplete_field` in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it in your widget tree.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:map_autocomplete_field/map_autocomplete_field.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Map Autocomplete Field Example')),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: MapAutocompleteField(
            apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY', // Your Google Places API key
            onSuggestionSelected: (suggestion) {
              // Handle the selected suggestion
              print('Selected: ${suggestion.description}');
            },
            decoration: InputDecoration(
              hintText: 'Search for a location',
              border: OutlineInputBorder(),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application with an autocomplete field for location searches. The `onSuggestionSelected` callback allows you to handle the user's selection.

# Complete Example of `map_autocomplete_field`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:map_autocomplete_field/map_autocomplete_field.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Map Autocomplete Field Example')),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: MapAutocompleteField(
            apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY', // Your Google Places API key
            onSuggestionSelected: (suggestion) {
              // Handle the selected suggestion
              print('Selected: ${suggestion.description}');
            },
            decoration: InputDecoration(
              hintText: 'Search for a location',
              border: OutlineInputBorder(),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The above code creates a simple Flutter application with a MapAutocompleteField.
// 1. The `MaterialApp` widget is the root of the application.
// 2. Inside the `Scaffold`, we have an `AppBar` with a title.
// 3. The `body` contains a `Padding` widget to provide some space around the autocomplete field.
// 4. The `MapAutocompleteField` is initialized with an API key and a callback for when a suggestion is selected.
// 5. The `decoration` property customizes the input field's appearance.
// 6. When a user selects a suggestion, it prints the selected location description to the console.
