# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the `loading_gifs` Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `loading_gifs` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  loading_gifs: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to display a loading GIF.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:loading_gifs/loading_gifs.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Loading GIFs Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Image.asset(
            LoadingGifs.rolling,
            width: 100, // Set the width of the GIF
            height: 100, // Set the height of the GIF
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we import the `loading_gifs` package and use one of its GIFs (`LoadingGifs.rolling`) in our app. The GIF is displayed in the center of the screen.

# Complete Example of Using the `loading_gifs` Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:loading_gifs/loading_gifs.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Loading GIFs Example'), // Title of the app
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Image.asset(
            LoadingGifs.rolling, // Using a rolling GIF from the package
            width: 100, // Set the width of the GIF
            height: 100, // Set the height of the GIF
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the app
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The runApp function takes the RealFlutter widget and makes it the root of the widget tree.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp, which provides the app structure.
// 4. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold widget is created, which provides the basic visual layout structure.
// 5. An AppBar is added to the Scaffold with a title.
// 6. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget, which centers its child.
// 7. The child of the Center widget is an Image widget that displays a loading GIF.
// 8. The GIF is loaded from the loading_gifs package and is displayed with specified width and height.
```
