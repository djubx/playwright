# Bonsai Flutter Package: A Comprehensive Overview

The **Bonsai** package for Flutter is a powerful tool designed to simplify the management of complex state and data flows in your applications. It provides a reactive programming model that allows developers to build highly responsive and maintainable applications with ease. 

## When to Use Bonsai
Bonsai is particularly useful in scenarios where:
- You need to manage complex state across multiple widgets.
- Your application requires real-time data updates.
- You want to implement a reactive programming model without the overhead of more complex state management solutions.

## Key Features
- **Reactive State Management**: Automatically updates the UI when the underlying data changes.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal boilerplate code, making it easy to integrate into existing projects.
- **Flexible Architecture**: Supports various architectural patterns, including MVVM and Redux-like structures.
- **Built-in Support for Streams**: Easily integrates with Dart's stream API for handling asynchronous data.

With these features, Bonsai stands out as a robust choice for Flutter developers looking to enhance their application's state management capabilities.

# Setting Up and Using the Bonsai Package

## Installation
To get started with the Bonsai package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  bonsai: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/bonsai).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use Bonsai in your Flutter application, you will typically create a model class that extends `BonsaiModel`. This model will hold your application's state and notify listeners when changes occur.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set up a Bonsai model:

```dart
import 'package:bonsai/bonsai.dart';

class MyModel extends BonsaiModel {
  int _counter = 0;

  int get counter => _counter;

  void increment() {
    _counter++;
    notifyListeners(); // Notify listeners about the state change
  }
}
```

You can then use this model in your Flutter widgets by wrapping them with a `BonsaiProvider`:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bonsai/bonsai.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(BonsaiProvider<MyModel>(
    create: (context) => MyModel(),
    child: MyApp(),
  ));
}
```

This setup allows your widgets to listen for changes in the `MyModel` instance and rebuild accordingly.

# Complete Example of Using the Bonsai Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bonsai/bonsai.dart';

// Define the model class that extends BonsaiModel
class MyModel extends BonsaiModel {
  int _counter = 0; // Private variable to hold the counter value

  int get counter => _counter; // Getter to access the counter value

  void increment() {
    _counter++; // Increment the counter
    notifyListeners(); // Notify listeners about the state change
  }
}

// Main application widget
void main() {
  runApp(BonsaiProvider<MyModel>(
    create: (context) => MyModel(), // Create an instance of MyModel
    child: MyApp(), // Pass the MyApp widget as the child
  ));
}

// The main application widget
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Bonsai Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Bonsai State Management'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Display the current counter value
              Text(
                'Counter Value: ${context.watch<MyModel>().counter}', 
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Button to increment the counter
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  context.read<MyModel>().increment(); // Call increment method on button press
                },
                child: Text('Increment Counter'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which initializes the BonsaiProvider with MyModel.
// 2. MyApp is built, which contains a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The center of the Scaffold displays the current counter value from MyModel.
// 4. When the "Increment Counter" button is pressed, it calls the increment() method on MyModel.
// 5. The increment() method updates the counter and calls notifyListeners(), which triggers a rebuild of the UI.
// 6. The updated counter value is displayed on the screen.
