## Setup Process

To use the `anim_search_bar` package in your Flutter application, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `anim_search_bar` dependency.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     anim_search_bar: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
   ```

2. **Install the Package**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21.

     ```groovy
     android {
         ...
         defaultConfig {
             ...
             minSdkVersion 21
         }
     }
     ```

   - **iOS**: No additional configuration is required for iOS, but ensure your deployment target is set appropriately in `ios/Podfile`.

4. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the package:

   ```dart
   import 'package:anim_search_bar/anim_search_bar.dart';
   ```

## Using the Package

To implement the `anim_search_bar`, you can follow this simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:anim_search_bar/anim_search_bar.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Controller for the search bar
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController();
  bool _isSearching = false;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Anim Search Bar Example'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // AnimSearchBar widget
          AnimSearchBar(
            width: 400,
            textController: _controller,
            onSuffixTap: () {
              // Clear the search bar when the suffix icon is tapped
              _controller.clear();
            },
            onSubmitted: (String value) {
              // Handle the search action
              print('Searching for: $value');
            },
          ),
          // Additional UI components can go here
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application with an animated search bar. The search bar expands when focused and collapses when unfocused or when the suffix icon is tapped.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:anim_search_bar/anim_search_bar.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Controller for the search bar
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController();
  bool _isSearching = false; // State to track if the search bar is active

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Anim Search Bar Example'), // Title of the app
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // AnimSearchBar widget
          AnimSearchBar(
            width: 400, // Width of the search bar
            textController: _controller, // Controller for managing text input
            onSuffixTap: () {
              // Clear the search bar when the suffix icon is tapped
              _controller.clear(); // Clear the text in the search bar
            },
            onSubmitted: (String value) {
              // Handle the search action
              print('Searching for: $value'); // Print the search query
            },
          ),
          // Additional UI components can go here
          Expanded(
            child: Center(
              child: Text('Search results will appear here'), // Placeholder for search results
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 2. The _RealFlutterState class manages the state of the search bar.
// 3. A TextEditingController is created to control the input of the search bar.
// 4. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Column containing the AnimSearchBar.
// 5. The AnimSearchBar expands when focused and allows users to input their search query.
// 6. When the suffix icon is tapped, the search bar clears its content.
// 7. Upon submitting a search query, the input is printed to the console.
// 8. An additional placeholder for search results is provided below the search bar.
```

In summary, the `anim_search_bar` package provides a visually appealing and functional search bar for Flutter applications. The setup process is straightforward, and the package can be easily integrated into existing projects. The complete example demonstrates how to implement the search bar and handle user input effectively.
