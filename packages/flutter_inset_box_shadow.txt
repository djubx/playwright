# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_inset_box_shadow

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_inset_box_shadow` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_inset_box_shadow: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_inset_box_shadow/flutter_inset_box_shadow.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using Inset Box Shadow

You can now use the `InsetBoxShadow` widget to apply inset shadows to your widgets. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use it:

```dart
Container(
  decoration: BoxDecoration(
    color: Colors.white,
    borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(12),
    boxShadow: [
      BoxShadow(
        color: Colors.black.withOpacity(0.2),
        offset: Offset(4, 4),
        blurRadius: 8,
        spreadRadius: 1,
      ),
    ],
  ),
  child: InsetBoxShadow(
    shadow: [
      BoxShadow(
        color: Colors.black.withOpacity(0.5),
        offset: Offset(-4, -4),
        blurRadius: 8,
        spreadRadius: 1,
      ),
    ],
    child: YourWidget(), // Replace with your actual widget
  ),
);
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 5: Optimizations

To optimize performance, consider using the `const` constructor for widgets that do not change, and avoid unnecessary rebuilds by using `ValueNotifier` or `ChangeNotifier` for state management.

With these steps, you are now ready to use the `flutter_inset_box_shadow` package in your Flutter applications!

# Complete Example of flutter_inset_box_shadow

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_inset_box_shadow/flutter_inset_box_shadow.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Inset Box Shadow Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Inset Box Shadow Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Container(
            width: 300,
            height: 200,
            decoration: BoxDecoration(
              color: Colors.white,
              borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(12),
              boxShadow: [
                // Standard shadow for the container
                BoxShadow(
                  color: Colors.black.withOpacity(0.2),
                  offset: Offset(4, 4),
                  blurRadius: 8,
                  spreadRadius: 1,
                ),
              ],
            ),
            child: InsetBoxShadow(
              // Applying inset shadow
              shadow: [
                BoxShadow(
                  color: Colors.black.withOpacity(0.5),
                  offset: Offset(-4, -4),
                  blurRadius: 8,
                  spreadRadius: 1,
                ),
              ],
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'Hello, Inset Shadow!',
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with a title and a Center widget in the body.
// 4. The Center widget holds a Container with a specified width and height.
// 5. The Container has a BoxDecoration with a white background, rounded corners, and a standard shadow.
// 6. Inside the Container, the InsetBoxShadow widget is used to apply an inset shadow effect.
// 7. The InsetBoxShadow wraps a Center widget that displays a text message.
// 8. The result is a visually appealing container with both standard and inset shadows, enhancing the UI.
