```dart

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Scankit Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  String _scannedResult = '';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Scankit Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Scankit(
              onScan: (result) {
                setState(() {
                  _scannedResult = result;
                });
              },
              onError: (error) {
                print('Error: $error');
              },
            ),
            Text(
              _scannedResult,
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user opens the app and is presented with a scanning interface.
// 2. The user scans a barcode using the camera.
// 3. The scanned result is displayed on the screen.
// 4. If an error occurs during scanning, an error message is printed to the console.
```

// In summary, this code creates a simple Flutter app that uses the `flutter_scankit` package to scan barcodes and display the scanned result on the screen.
