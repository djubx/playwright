# Auto Start Flutter Package

The `auto_start_flutter` package is a powerful tool designed to simplify the process of automatically starting Flutter applications. This package is particularly useful for developers who want to ensure that their apps can resume from a specific state or perform certain actions immediately upon launch. 

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the `auto_start_flutter` package in scenarios such as:
- **Background Services**: If your app needs to perform tasks in the background and resume seamlessly when opened.
- **State Restoration**: When you want to restore the app's state to a specific point, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- **Initial Data Fetching**: Automatically fetching data or performing initial setup tasks when the app starts.

## Features

- **Automatic Start**: Automatically starts the app with predefined settings or states.
- **Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Customizable**: Allows developers to define specific actions to be taken on startup.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Auto Start Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `auto_start_flutter` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `auto_start_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  auto_start_flutter: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `AndroidManifest.xml` located in `android/app/src/main/`.
2. Ensure you have the necessary permissions and configurations. For example:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.auto_start_flutter">

    <application
        android:label="auto_start_flutter"
        android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher">
        <activity
            android:name=".MainActivity"
            android:launchMode="singleTask">
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN"/>
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER"/>
            </intent-filter>
        </activity>
    </application>
</manifest>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `Info.plist` located in `ios/Runner/`.
2. Add any necessary configurations, such as permissions for background tasks if required.

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>fetch</string>
</array>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. The following example demonstrates how to implement the `auto_start_flutter` package in a simple Flutter app.

# Complete Example of Using Auto Start Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:auto_start_flutter/auto_start_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Auto Start Flutter Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  String _status = "Initializing...";

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Start the auto start process
    _startAutoProcess();
  }

  void _startAutoProcess() async {
    // Simulate a background task or data fetching
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));
    setState(() {
      _status = "App Started Successfully!";
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Auto Start Flutter Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          _status,
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter builds the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is set as the home screen of the app.
// 4. In the HomeScreen's initState, the _startAutoProcess method is called.
// 5. _startAutoProcess simulates a delay (e.g., fetching data) and updates the status.
// 6. The UI displays the current status, which changes after the delay.
```

// The application starts with the main function, which initializes the RealFlutter app. 
// The app builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme, setting HomeScreen as the home widget. 
// In the HomeScreen's initState, the _startAutoProcess method is called, simulating a background task. 
// After a 2-second delay, the status is updated to indicate that the app has started successfully, 
// and this status is displayed in the center of the screen.
