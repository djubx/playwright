## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the `AutoSizeTextPlus` widget, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:auto_size_text_plus/auto_size_text_plus.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using AutoSizeTextPlus

You can now use the `AutoSizeTextPlus` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
AutoSizeTextPlus(
  'This is a sample text that will automatically resize.',
  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 30),
  maxLines: 2,
  minFontSize: 12,
  maxFontSize: 30,
  textAlign: TextAlign.center,
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

#### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Customization Options

The `AutoSizeTextPlus` widget comes with several properties that allow you to customize its behavior:

- `minFontSize`: The minimum font size to use when resizing.

# Complete Example of Auto Size Text Plus

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:auto_size_text_plus/auto_size_text_plus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Auto Size Text Plus Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Auto Size Text Plus Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Container(
            width: 300, // Set a fixed width for the container
            height: 100, // Set a fixed height for the container
            child: AutoSizeTextPlus(
              'This text will resize to fit within the container!',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 30, color: Colors.black),
              maxLines: 2, // Allow up to 2 lines
              minFontSize: 12, // Minimum font size
              maxFontSize: 30, // Maximum font size
              textAlign: TextAlign.center, // Center align the text
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Auto Size Text Plus Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers a Container widget.
// 5. The Container has a fixed width and height, providing a bounding box for the text.
// 6. Inside the Container, the AutoSizeTextPlus widget is used to display the text.
// 7. The AutoSizeTextPlus widget automatically resizes the text to fit within the specified dimensions, ensuring it remains legible and well-fitted.
// 8. The text is styled with a font size of 30, but it can shrink to a minimum of 12 if necessary, and it can grow up to a maximum of 30.
// 9. The text is also center-aligned, making it visually appealing within the container.
