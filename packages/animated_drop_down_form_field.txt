void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animated Dropdown Example',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String? selectedOption; // Variable to hold the selected option

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Animated Dropdown Example')),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            // Animated dropdown form field
            AnimatedDropDownFormField(
              items: ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3'], // Dropdown items
              onChanged: (value) {
                setState(() {
                  selectedOption = value; // Update the selected option
                });
                print('Selected: $value'); // Print the selected value
              },
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Select an Option', // Label for the dropdown
                border: OutlineInputBorder(), // Border style
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between dropdown and button
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action when button is pressed
                if (selectedOption != null) {
                  // Check if an option is selected
                  ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                    SnackBar(content: Text('You selected: $selectedOption')),
                  );
                } else {
                  // Show a message if no option is selected
                  ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                    SnackBar(content: Text('Please select an option')),
                  );
                }
              },
              child: Text('Submit'), // Button text
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home as RealFlutter.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains the selected option state.
// 4. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body containing a dropdown and a button.
// 5. The AnimatedDropDownFormField is created with a list of items and an onChanged callback.
// 6. When an item is selected, the selectedOption state is updated, and the selected value is printed.
// 7. The Submit button checks if an option is selected and shows a SnackBar with the selected option or a prompt to select one.
