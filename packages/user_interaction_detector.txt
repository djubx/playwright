# User Interaction Detector Flutter Package

The `user_interaction_detector` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that allows you to detect user interactions within your application. This package is particularly useful for applications that require tracking user engagement, such as games, educational apps, or any app where user interaction is critical for functionality.

## When to Use This Package
- **Games**: To track user interactions for scoring or game mechanics.
- **Educational Apps**: To monitor how users interact with learning materials.
- **Analytics**: To gather data on user engagement and improve user experience.

## Features
- **Touch Detection**: Detects various touch events such as taps, swipes, and long presses.
- **Gesture Recognition**: Recognizes complex gestures, allowing for a more interactive experience.
- **Customizable Callbacks**: Provides the ability to define custom actions based on user interactions.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using User Interaction Detector

## Installation
To add the `user_interaction_detector` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  user_interaction_detector: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your app requires any specific user permissions related to touch interactions.

## Using the Package
To use the `user_interaction_detector`, you will typically wrap your widget with the `UserInteractionDetector` widget. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:user_interaction_detector/user_interaction_detector.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('User Interaction Detector Example')),
        body: UserInteractionDetector(
          onTap: () {
            print('User tapped!');
          },
          onSwipe: () {
            print('User swiped!');
          },
          child: Center(child: Text('Interact with me!')),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `UserInteractionDetector` widget listens for tap and swipe gestures and executes the corresponding callbacks.

# Complete Example of User Interaction Detector

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:user_interaction_detector/user_interaction_detector.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('User Interaction Detector Example')),
        body: UserInteractionDetector(
          // Callback for tap events
          onTap: () {
            print('User tapped!'); // Log tap event
          },
          // Callback for swipe events
          onSwipe: () {
            print('User swiped!'); // Log swipe event
          },
          // Child widget that will detect interactions
          child: Center(
            child: GestureDetector(
              // Additional gesture detection for long press
              onLongPress: () {
                print('User long pressed!'); // Log long press event
              },
              child: Container(
                padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
                color: Colors.blue,
                child: Text(
                  'Interact with me!',
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, a UserInteractionDetector is used to listen for user interactions.
// 4. The onTap and onSwipe callbacks are defined to log messages when the user interacts.
// 5. A GestureDetector is also used to detect long press events, providing additional interaction capabilities.
// 6. The child widget is a Container that displays a message, and it changes color when interacted with.
