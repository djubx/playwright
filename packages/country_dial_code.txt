# Tutorial: Setting Up the Country Dial Code Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `country_dial_code` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `country_dial_code` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  country_dial_code: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/country_dial_code).

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` file to allow for network requests if your app requires it. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that the package is set up, you can use it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a country dial code selector.

# Complete Example of Using the Country Dial Code Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:country_dial_code/country_dial_code.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Country Dial Code Example',
      home: CountryDialCodeExample(),
    );
  }
}

class CountryDialCodeExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CountryDialCodeExampleState createState() => _CountryDialCodeExampleState();
}

class _CountryDialCodeExampleState extends State<CountryDialCodeExample> {
  String selectedDialCode = '+1'; // Default dial code (USA)
  String phoneNumber = '';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Country Dial Code Selector'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            // Dropdown for selecting country dial code
            DropdownButton<String>(
              value: selectedDialCode,
              items: CountryDialCode.getAllDialCodes().map((String code) {
                return DropdownMenuItem<String>(
                  value: code,
                  child: Text(code),
                );
              }).toList(),
              onChanged: (String? newValue) {
                setState(() {
                  selectedDialCode = newValue!;
                });
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // TextField for entering phone number
            TextField(
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Phone Number',
                border: OutlineInputBorder(),
              ),
              onChanged: (value) {
                phoneNumber = value;
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to submit the phone number
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Handle the submission of the phone number
                print('Dial Code: $selectedDialCode, Phone Number: $phoneNumber');
              },
              child: Text('Submit'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up a MaterialApp with a title and home widget.
// 3. The CountryDialCodeExample widget is a stateful widget that maintains the selected dial code and phone number.
// 4. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body containing a dropdown for selecting the dial code,
//    a text field for entering the phone number, and a submit button.
// 5. When the user selects a dial code from the dropdown, the state is updated to reflect the selection.
// 6. The user can enter their phone number in the text field.
// 7. Upon pressing the submit button, the selected dial code and phone number are printed to the console.
```
