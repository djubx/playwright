# Flutter Map Marker Cluster 2 Package

The `flutter_map_marker_cluster_2` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers who need to display a large number of markers on a map efficiently. This package builds upon the popular `flutter_map` package, providing clustering capabilities that help manage and visualize multiple markers without overwhelming the user interface.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using `flutter_map_marker_cluster_2` in scenarios such as:

- **Displaying Large Datasets**: When you have a significant number of geographical points (e.g., locations of restaurants, events, or points of interest), clustering helps in reducing clutter on the map.
- **Improving User Experience**: By grouping nearby markers, users can easily navigate and interact with the map without being distracted by too many markers.
- **Dynamic Data**: If your application requires real-time updates to the markers (e.g., live tracking of vehicles), this package can efficiently handle the clustering of markers as they change.

## Features

- **Automatic Clustering**: The package automatically groups markers based on their proximity, adjusting the clusters as the user zooms in and out.
- **Customizable Cluster Icons**: You can customize the appearance of the cluster markers to fit your application's design.
- **Integration with Flutter Map**: Seamlessly integrates with the `flutter_map` package, allowing you to leverage existing map functionalities.
- **Performance Optimization**: Designed to handle a large number of markers without significant performance degradation.

With these features, `flutter_map_marker_cluster_2` is an excellent choice for any Flutter application that requires map-based data visualization.

# Tutorial: Setting Up flutter_map_marker_cluster_2

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_map_marker_cluster_2` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependencies

First, you need to add the necessary dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Include both `flutter_map` and `flutter_map_marker_cluster_2`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_map: ^0.14.0
  flutter_map_marker_cluster_2: ^0.2.0
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to add permissions for location services in your `Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show nearby markers.</string>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the dependencies and configurations, you can start using the package in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement clustering with `flutter_map_marker_cluster_2`.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_map/flutter_map.dart';
import 'package:flutter_map_marker_cluster_2/flutter_map_marker_cluster_2.dart';
import 'package:latlong2/latlong.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Map Marker Cluster Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Marker Cluster Example'),
        ),
        body: MapScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MapScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample data for markers
    final List<Marker> markers = [
      Marker(
        point: LatLng(51.5, -0.09),
        builder: (ctx) => Container(
          child: Icon(Icons.location_on, color: Colors.red),
        ),
      ),
      Marker(
        point: LatLng(51.51, -0.1),
        builder: (ctx) => Container(
          child: Icon(Icons.location_on, color: Colors.red),
        ),
      ),
      // Add more markers as needed
    ];

    return FlutterMap(
      options: MapOptions(
        center: LatLng(51.5, -0.09), // Center of the map
        zoom: 13.0, // Initial zoom level
      ),
      layers: [
        TileLayerOptions(
          urlTemplate: "https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",
          subdomains: ['a', 'b', 'c'],
        ),
        MarkerClusterLayerOptions(
          markers: markers, // List of markers to cluster
          builder: (context, markers) {
            return FloatingActionButton(
              child: Text(markers.length.toString()), // Show number of markers in cluster
              onPressed: () {},
            );
          },
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The RealFlutter class builds the main structure of the app, including the AppBar and the MapScreen.
// 3. The MapScreen class creates a FlutterMap widget with a list of markers.
// 4. The markers are displayed on the map, and when they are close together, they are clustered.
// 5. The FloatingActionButton in the cluster shows the number of markers in that cluster.
// 6. Users can interact with the map, zooming in and out to see more or fewer clusters.
