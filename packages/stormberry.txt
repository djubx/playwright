# Exploring the Stormberry Flutter Package

The **Stormberry** package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who want to implement real-time data synchronization and offline capabilities in their applications. It is particularly useful for applications that require a seamless user experience, even in low or no connectivity scenarios. 

## When to Use Stormberry
- **Real-time Applications**: Ideal for chat applications, collaborative tools, or any app that requires instant data updates.
- **Offline Functionality**: Perfect for apps that need to function without an internet connection, such as note-taking apps or field data collection tools.
- **Data Synchronization**: Useful for applications that need to sync data between local storage and a remote server.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Data Sync**: Automatically syncs data between the local database and the server.
- **Offline Support**: Allows users to continue using the app without an internet connection, with changes being synced once connectivity is restored.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that integrates seamlessly with existing Flutter applications.
- **Customizable**: Offers flexibility in how data is managed and synchronized.

Stormberry is an excellent choice for developers looking to enhance their Flutter applications with robust data handling capabilities.

# Setting Up and Using Stormberry

## Installation
To add Stormberry to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  stormberry: ^latest_version
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21.
2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml` for internet access and network state:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to allow network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
To use Stormberry, you need to initialize it in your main application file. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set it up:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:stormberry/stormberry.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Stormberry Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  // Initialize Stormberry
  final Stormberry stormberry = Stormberry();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Start Stormberry
    stormberry.start();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Stop Stormberry
    stormberry.stop();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Stormberry Example')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Welcome to Stormberry!')),
    );
  }
}
```

This code initializes Stormberry when the app starts and stops it when the app is disposed. You can now build upon this foundation to implement real-time data synchronization and offline capabilities.

# Complete Example of Stormberry in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:stormberry/stormberry.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Stormberry Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  // Initialize Stormberry
  final Stormberry stormberry = Stormberry();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Start Stormberry for real-time data sync
    stormberry.start();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Stop Stormberry to clean up resources
    stormberry.stop();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Stormberry Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Welcome to Stormberry!'),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Example of adding data to Stormberry
                stormberry.addData({'message': 'Hello, Stormberry!'});
              },
              child: Text('Send Data'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds the MaterialApp and sets HomeScreen as the home widget.
// 3. HomeScreen initializes Stormberry in initState, allowing for real-time data sync.
// 4. When the app is disposed, Stormberry is stopped to free up resources.
// 5. The UI displays a welcome message and a button to send data.
// 6. Pressing the button triggers the addData method of Stormberry, simulating data sending.
