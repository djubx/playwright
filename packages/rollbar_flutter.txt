// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The RealFlutter class is defined to demonstrate the usage of the m3u_nullsafe package.
// 2. The parseM3uPlaylist method is defined to parse an M3U playlist.
// 3. The demonstrateUsage method is defined to call the parseM3uPlaylist method.
// 4. A RealFlutter instance is created.
// 5. The demonstrateUsage method is called to demonstrate the usage of the m3u_nullsafe package.
// 6. The parseM3uPlaylist method is called to parse an M3U playlist.
// 7. The M3U playlist is parsed and the entries are printed out.

// In summary, the code demonstrates the usage of the m3u_nullsafe package by parsing an M3U playlist and printing out the entries.
