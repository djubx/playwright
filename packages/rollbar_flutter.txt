# Overview of the rollbar_flutter Package

The `rollbar_flutter` package is a Flutter plugin that integrates the Rollbar error tracking service into your Flutter applications. Rollbar provides real-time error monitoring and debugging capabilities, allowing developers to track and resolve issues efficiently. This package is particularly useful for applications that require robust error handling and monitoring, ensuring that developers are notified of any issues that arise in production.

## When to Use This Package
- **Error Tracking**: If your application is in production and you want to monitor errors in real-time.
- **Debugging**: When you need detailed error reports to help diagnose issues quickly.
- **User Feedback**: To gather insights on how users are experiencing your app, especially in terms of crashes and bugs.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Error Reporting**: Automatically sends error reports to Rollbar as they occur.
- **Custom Error Handling**: Allows developers to log custom messages and exceptions.
- **User Context**: Captures user information to provide context for errors.
- **Environment Tracking**: Supports tracking errors across different environments (development, staging, production).

# Setting Up rollbar_flutter

To get started with the `rollbar_flutter` package, follow these steps:

## Step 1: Add Dependency
Add the `rollbar_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  rollbar_flutter: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21 // or higher
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add the Rollbar API key in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:
   ```xml
   <meta-data
       android:name="ROLLBAR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
       android:value="YOUR_ROLLBAR_ACCESS_TOKEN" />
   ```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:
   ```xml
   <key>ROLLBAR_ACCESS_TOKEN</key>
   <string>YOUR_ROLLBAR_ACCESS_TOKEN</string>
   ```

2. Ensure you have the necessary permissions in your `Podfile`:
   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

## Step 3: Initialize Rollbar
In your main Dart file, initialize Rollbar in the `main()` function:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:rollbar_flutter/rollbar_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize Rollbar with your access token
  Rollbar.init(
    accessToken: 'YOUR_ROLLBAR_ACCESS_TOKEN',
    environment: 'production', // or 'development', 'staging'
  );
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 4: Logging Errors
You can log errors using the following methods:

```dart
try {
  // Your code that may throw an exception
} catch (e, stackTrace) {
  // Log the error to Rollbar
  Rollbar.error(e, stackTrace: stackTrace);
}
```

You can also log custom messages:

```dart
Rollbar.info('This is a custom log message');
```

Now you are ready to use the `rollbar_flutter` package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of rollbar_flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:rollbar_flutter/rollbar_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize Rollbar with your access token
  Rollbar.init(
    accessToken: 'YOUR_ROLLBAR_ACCESS_TOKEN',
    environment: 'production', // Set the environment
  );
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Rollbar Flutter Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Rollbar Flutter Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Simulate an error
              throw Exception('This is a simulated error for testing Rollbar!');
            },
            child: Text('Trigger Error'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The following comments explain the flow of the application:
// 1. The main function initializes Rollbar with the access token and environment.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is the main application widget.
// 3. The MaterialApp widget sets up the app's title and home screen.
// 4. The home screen contains a button that, when pressed, throws an exception.
// 5. The exception is caught by Rollbar, which logs it in real-time for monitoring.
// 6. This allows developers to see the error in the Rollbar dashboard and take action accordingly.

```

In summary, the `rollbar_flutter` package provides a powerful way to monitor and log errors in your Flutter applications. By following the setup and usage instructions, you can ensure that your app is equipped to handle errors effectively, providing you with the insights needed to improve your application's stability and user experience.
