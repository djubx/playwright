# Move Detector Flutter Package

The **move_detector** package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to detect and respond to user movements and gestures. This package is particularly useful in applications that require motion detection, such as fitness apps, games, or augmented reality experiences. By leveraging the device's sensors, developers can create interactive and engaging user experiences.

## When to Use This Package
- **Fitness Applications**: Track user movements during workouts.
- **Games**: Implement motion-based controls for a more immersive experience.
- **Augmented Reality**: Enhance AR applications by detecting user movements.

## Features
- **Sensor Integration**: Access to accelerometer and gyroscope data.
- **Real-time Movement Detection**: Respond to user movements instantly.
- **Customizable Sensitivity**: Adjust the sensitivity of movement detection to suit different use cases.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices.

The **move_detector** package is an excellent choice for developers looking to add motion detection capabilities to their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Move Detector

## Installation
To get started with the **move_detector** package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  move_detector: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/move_detector).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file. Add the following lines within the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BODY_SENSORS"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you need to add the following key to your `Info.plist` file to request permission for motion data:

```xml
<key>NSMotionUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to motion data.</string>
```

## Using the Package
Once you have installed the package and configured the necessary permissions, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement movement detection.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:move_detector/move_detector.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _movementStatus = "No Movement Detected";

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Move Detector Example")),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text(_movementStatus),
            MoveDetector(
              onMove: (details) {
                setState(() {
                  _movementStatus = "Movement Detected: ${details.movementType}";
                });
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple UI that displays the movement status. The `MoveDetector` widget listens for movement events and updates the UI accordingly.

# Complete Example of Move Detector

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:move_detector/move_detector.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to hold the movement status
  String _movementStatus = "No Movement Detected";

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Move Detector Example")),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Display the current movement status
              Text(_movementStatus),
              // MoveDetector widget to listen for movement events
              MoveDetector(
                onMove: (details) {
                  // Update the movement status when movement is detected
                  setState(() {
                    _movementStatus = "Movement Detected: ${details.movementType}";
                  });
                },
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 3. Inside the _RealFlutterState, a variable _movementStatus is initialized to hold the current movement status.
// 4. The build method constructs the UI, which includes an AppBar and a Center widget containing a Column.
// 5. The Column displays the current movement status and includes the MoveDetector widget.
// 6. The MoveDetector listens for movement events and calls the onMove callback when movement is detected.
// 7. Inside the onMove callback, the state is updated to reflect the detected movement, which triggers a UI rebuild.
