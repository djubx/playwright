            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Apply the sepia filter
                _filteredimage = Photofilters.applyFilter(_image, FilterType.sepia);

                // Update the UI with the filtered image
                setState(() {});
              },
              child: Text('Apply Sepia Filter'),
            ),

            // Display the filtered image
            _filteredimage != null ? _filteredimage : Container(),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and sees the original image.
// 2. The user clicks the "Apply Sepia Filter" button.
// 3. The sepia filter is applied to the original image using the Photofilters.applyFilter method.
// 4. The UI is updated with the filtered image.
// 5. The user sees the filtered image displayed below the original image.

// This code demonstrates the basic usage of the photofilters package.
// You can experiment with different filter types and intensities to achieve various effects.
