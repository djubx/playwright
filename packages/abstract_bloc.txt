// The app flow is as follows:
// 1. The app starts and the RealFlutterApp widget is created.
// 2. The RealFlutterApp widget creates a BlocProvider widget and passes the RealFlutterBloc instance to it.
// 3. The BlocProvider widget creates a MaterialApp widget and passes the RealFlutterHomePage widget as its home page.
// 4. The RealFlutterHomePage widget creates a Scaffold widget and passes the BlocBuilder widget as its body.
// 5. The BlocBuilder widget builds the UI based on the current state of the RealFlutterBloc.
// 6. When the user presses the floating action button, the RealFlutterLoadDataEvent is dispatched to the RealFlutterBloc.
// 7. The RealFlutterBloc handles the RealFlutterLoadDataEvent and loads the data from the API or database.
// 8. Once the data is loaded, the RealFlutterBloc emits the RealFlutterDataLoadedState.
// 9. The BlocBuilder widget rebuilds the UI based on the new state.
