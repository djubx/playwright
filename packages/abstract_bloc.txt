# Overview of the abstract_bloc Flutter Package

The `abstract_bloc` package is a powerful tool designed to simplify state management in Flutter applications. It provides a structured way to implement the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern, which helps separate business logic from UI code, making applications more maintainable and testable.

## When to Use `abstract_bloc`

You should consider using `abstract_bloc` when:
- You want to implement a clean architecture in your Flutter app.
- You need to manage complex states and events in your application.
- You want to improve the testability of your business logic.

## Key Features
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clearly separates UI from business logic.
- **Event-Driven**: Uses events to trigger state changes, making it easy to manage user interactions.
- **Testable**: Facilitates unit testing of business logic without the need for UI components.
- **Extensible**: Can be easily extended to fit specific application needs.

Overall, `abstract_bloc` is an excellent choice for developers looking to implement a robust state management solution in their Flutter applications.

# Setting Up and Using abstract_bloc

## Installation

To add the `abstract_bloc` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  abstract_bloc: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/abstract_bloc).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
No specific configurations are required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 9.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
```

## Basic Usage

1. **Create Events**: Define events that will trigger state changes.
2. **Create States**: Define the various states your application can be in.
3. **Create a BLoC**: Implement the BLoC class that will handle the logic.
4. **Integrate with UI**: Use the BLoC in your Flutter widgets to respond to events and update the UI.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set up a counter using `abstract_bloc`:

```dart
import 'package:abstract_bloc/abstract_bloc.dart';

// Define the events
abstract class CounterEvent {}

class IncrementEvent extends CounterEvent {}

class DecrementEvent extends CounterEvent {}

// Define the states
abstract class CounterState {}

class CounterInitial extends CounterState {
  final int count;
  CounterInitial(this.count);
}

// Create the BLoC
class CounterBloc extends Bloc<CounterEvent, CounterState> {
  CounterBloc() : super(CounterInitial(0));

  @override
  Stream<CounterState> mapEventToState(CounterEvent event) async* {
    if (event is IncrementEvent) {
      yield CounterInitial((state as CounterInitial).count + 1);
    } else if (event is DecrementEvent) {
      yield CounterInitial((state as CounterInitial).count - 1);
    }
  }
}
```

This setup allows you to manage a simple counter state using events to increment or decrement the count.

# Complete Example of Using abstract_bloc

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:abstract_bloc/abstract_bloc.dart';

// Define the events
abstract class CounterEvent {}

class IncrementEvent extends CounterEvent {}

class DecrementEvent extends CounterEvent {}

// Define the states
abstract class CounterState {}

class CounterInitial extends CounterState {
  final int count;
  CounterInitial(this.count);
}

// Create the BLoC
class CounterBloc extends Bloc<CounterEvent, CounterState> {
  CounterBloc() : super(CounterInitial(0));

  @override
  Stream<CounterState> mapEventToState(CounterEvent event) async* {
    // Check if the event is IncrementEvent
    if (event is IncrementEvent) {
      // Yield a new state with incremented count
      yield CounterInitial((state as CounterInitial).count + 1);
    } 
    // Check if the event is DecrementEvent
    else if (event is DecrementEvent) {
      // Yield a new state with decremented count
      yield CounterInitial((state as CounterInitial).count - 1);
    }
  }
}

// Main application widget
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Counter App',
      home: BlocProvider(
        create: (context) => CounterBloc(),
        child: CounterPage(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class CounterPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Access the BLoC
    final counterBloc = BlocProvider.of<CounterBloc>(context);

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Counter App'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: BlocBuilder<CounterBloc, CounterState>(
          builder: (context, state) {
            // Display the current count
            if (state is CounterInitial) {
              return Text('Count: ${state.count}', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24));
            }
            return CircularProgressIndicator();
          },
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: Row(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.end,
        children: [
          FloatingActionButton(
            onPressed: () => counterBloc.add(IncrementEvent()), // Increment count
            tooltip: 'Increment',
            child: Icon(Icons.add),
          ),
          SizedBox(width: 10),
          FloatingActionButton(
            onPressed: () => counterBloc.add(DecrementEvent()), // Decrement count
            tooltip: 'Decrement',
            child: Icon(Icons.remove),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs MyApp.
// 2. MyApp initializes the CounterBloc and provides it to the CounterPage.
// 3. In CounterPage, the BlocBuilder listens for state changes in the CounterBloc.
// 4. When the Increment or Decrement button is pressed, an event is added to the BLoC.
// 5. The BLoC processes the event and updates the state accordingly.
// 6. The BlocBuilder rebuilds the UI with the new count value whenever the state changes.
