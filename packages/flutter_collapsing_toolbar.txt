# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_collapsing_toolbar

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_collapsing_toolbar` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_collapsing_toolbar` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_collapsing_toolbar: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the collapsing toolbar.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_collapsing_toolbar/flutter_collapsing_toolbar.dart';
```

2. Create a new widget that uses the `CollapsingToolbar`:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: CollapsingToolbar(
        title: Text("Collapsing Toolbar Example"),
        background: Image.network(
          'https://example.com/image.jpg',
          fit: BoxFit.cover,
        ),
        body: ListView(
          children: List.generate(30, (index) {
            return ListTile(
              title: Text("Item $index"),
            );
          }),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Run your application to see the collapsing toolbar in action!

This setup provides a basic implementation of the `flutter_collapsing_toolbar` package. You can further customize the toolbar and its behavior according to your application's needs.

# Complete Example of flutter_collapsing_toolbar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_collapsing_toolbar/flutter_collapsing_toolbar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Collapsing Toolbar Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: CollapsingToolbar(
        title: Text("Collapsing Toolbar Example"), // Title of the toolbar
        background: Image.network(
          'https://example.com/image.jpg', // Background image for the toolbar
          fit: BoxFit.cover, // Ensures the image covers the toolbar area
        ),
        body: ListView(
          children: List.generate(30, (index) {
            return ListTile(
              title: Text("Item $index"), // List items to display
            );
          }),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme, and specifies RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter builds a Scaffold containing a CollapsingToolbar.
// 4. The CollapsingToolbar has a title and a background image, which collapses as the user scrolls.
// 5. The body of the toolbar contains a ListView with 30 items, allowing for scrolling and demonstrating the collapsing effect.
