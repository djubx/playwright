# Complete Example of Squadron Builder

Here is a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the **squadron_builder** package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:squadron_builder/squadron_builder.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Squadron Builder Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Squadron Builder Example'),
        ),
        body: SquadronBuilder(
          // Using SquadronBuilder to manage the layout
          children: [
            // Adding a title widget
            Text(
              'Welcome to Squadron Builder',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
            ),
            // Adding a button that will trigger an action
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action when button is pressed
                print('Button Pressed!');
              },
              child: Text('Press Me'),
            ),
            // Adding a list of items
            SquadronList(
              items: List.generate(10, (index) => 'Item $index'),
              itemBuilder: (context, item) {
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text(item),
                );
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body uses SquadronBuilder to manage a list of children widgets.
// 5. The first child is a Text widget displaying a welcome message.
// 6. The second child is an ElevatedButton that prints a message to the console when pressed.
// 7. The third child is a SquadronList that generates a list of items dynamically.
// 8. Each item in the list is displayed using a ListTile widget.
