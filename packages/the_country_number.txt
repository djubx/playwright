# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Country Number Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **the_country_number** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  the_country_number: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` file to include permissions for network access if your application requires it. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:the_country_number/the_country_number.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package

You can now use the package to retrieve country codes and dialing codes. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use it:

```dart
void main() {
  // Example usage of the package
  var countryInfo = CountryNumber.getCountryInfo('US');
  print('Country: ${countryInfo.name}, Dialing Code: ${countryInfo.dialingCode}');
}
```

This code retrieves the country information for the United States and prints the country name along with its dialing code.

# Complete Example: Flutter Application Using the Country Number Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:the_country_number/the_country_number.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Country Number Example',
      home: CountryInfoScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class CountryInfoScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CountryInfoScreenState createState() => _CountryInfoScreenState();
}

class _CountryInfoScreenState extends State<CountryInfoScreen> {
  String _countryCode = '';
  String _dialingCode = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Fetching country information for the United States (US)
    var countryInfo = CountryNumber.getCountryInfo('US');
    setState(() {
      _countryCode = countryInfo.name; // Storing the country name
      _dialingCode = countryInfo.dialingCode; // Storing the dialing code
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Country Number Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Country: $_countryCode'), // Displaying the country name
            Text('Dialing Code: $_dialingCode'), // Displaying the dialing code
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets the home to CountryInfoScreen.
// 3. CountryInfoScreen is a stateful widget that fetches country information in initState.
// 4. The country information for the United States is retrieved using CountryNumber.getCountryInfo().
// 5. The country name and dialing code are stored in state variables and displayed in the UI.
// 6. The UI consists of a simple Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget displaying the country name and dialing code.
```
