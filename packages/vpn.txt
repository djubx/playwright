}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user opens the app and is presented with a button to connect to the VPN.
// 2. When the user clicks the button, the VPN connection is established using the VpnConnection class.
// 3. The VpnConnection class handles the VPN connection events, such as when the connection is established or disconnected.
// 4. When the VPN connection is established, the user can use the app as normal, with the VPN connection providing a secure and private connection.
// 5. When the user is finished using the app, they can disconnect from the VPN using the disconnect button.

// In summary, the code flows as follows:
// 1. The user opens the app and is presented with a button to connect to the VPN.
// 2. The user clicks the button, which establishes the VPN connection using the VpnConnection class.
// 3. The VpnConnection class handles the VPN connection events.
// 4. The user uses the app as normal, with the VPN connection providing a secure and private connection.
// 5. The user disconnects from the VPN using the disconnect button.
