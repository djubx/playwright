# Complete Example of Using the Cell Calendar Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cell_calendar/cell_calendar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Cell Calendar Example',
      home: CalendarHome(),
    );
  }
}

class CalendarHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CalendarHomeState createState() => _CalendarHomeState();
}

class _CalendarHomeState extends State<CalendarHome> {
  DateTime? selectedDate; // Variable to hold the selected date
  final Map<DateTime, List<String>> events = { // Map to hold events for specific dates
    DateTime(2024, 9, 15): ['Event 1', 'Event 2'],
    DateTime(2024, 9, 20): ['Event 3'],
  };

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Cell Calendar Example'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Display the calendar widget
          CellCalendar(
            onDateSelected: (date) {
              setState(() {
                selectedDate = date; // Update the selected date
              });
              print("Selected date: $date"); // Log the selected date
            },
            events: events, // Pass the events map to the calendar
          ),
          // Display selected date and events
          if (selectedDate != null) ...[
            Text(
              'Selected Date: ${selectedDate!.toLocal()}'.split(' ')[0], // Display the selected date
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            // Display events for the selected date
            ...events[selectedDate!]!.map((event) => Text(event)).toList(),
          ],
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home page.
// 3. The CalendarHome widget is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the selected date and events.
// 4. The CellCalendar widget is displayed, allowing users to select dates and view events.
// 5. When a date is selected, the onDateSelected callback updates the selectedDate state and logs the date.
// 6. The selected date and its associated events are displayed below the calendar.
