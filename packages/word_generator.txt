<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Word Generator Flutter Package

The **word_generator** Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to generate random words, phrases, or sentences. This package is particularly useful for applications that require placeholder text, such as during the development phase, or for games and educational apps that need random word generation.

## When to Use This Package
- **Placeholder Text**: When developing UI components, you may need random text to fill in spaces.
- **Games**: For word-based games where random words are required.
- **Educational Apps**: To create quizzes or exercises that require random vocabulary.

## Features
- **Random Word Generation**: Generate single words or phrases.
- **Customizable**: Options to specify the length and type of words.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup and usage within Flutter applications.

## Example Use Cases
- Generating random names for characters in a game.
- Creating dummy text for UI testing.
- Providing random vocabulary for language learning apps.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Word Generator Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the **word_generator** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  word_generator: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package
Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your `ios/Podfile` has the platform version set to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:word_generator/word_generator.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package
You can now use the `WordGenerator` class to generate words. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
void main() {
  final generator = WordGenerator();
  String randomWord = generator.generateWord();
  print(randomWord); // Outputs a random word
}
```

This basic setup allows you to start generating random words in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using the Word Generator Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:word_generator/word_generator.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Word Generator App',
      home: WordGeneratorHome(),
    );
  }
}

class WordGeneratorHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _WordGeneratorHomeState createState() => _WordGeneratorHomeState();
}

class _WordGeneratorHomeState extends State<WordGeneratorHome> {
  // Create an instance of WordGenerator
  final WordGenerator _wordGenerator = WordGenerator();
  String _randomWord = '';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Random Word Generator'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display the generated random word
            Text(
              _randomWord.isEmpty ? 'Press the button to generate a word' : _randomWord,
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _generateRandomWord,
              child: Text('Generate Random Word'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to generate a random word
  void _generateRandomWord() {
    setState(() {
      // Generate a new random word and update the state
      _randomWord = _wordGenerator.generateWord();
    });
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget (WordGeneratorHome).
// 3. WordGeneratorHome is a stateful widget that maintains the state of the generated word.
// 4. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget containing a Column.
// 5. The Column displays the current random word and a button to generate a new word.
// 6. When the button is pressed, the _generateRandomWord method is called, which updates the state with a new random word.
// 7. The UI is rebuilt to display the newly generated word.
```
