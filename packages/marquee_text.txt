# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Marquee Text Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `marquee_text` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  marquee_text: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the marquee text, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:marquee_text/marquee_text.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the MarqueeText Widget

You can now use the `MarqueeText` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
MarqueeText(
  text: Text(
    'Welcome to RealFlutter! Enjoy scrolling text effects.',
    style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
  ),
  scrollAxis: Axis.horizontal, // Choose the scroll direction
  velocity: 50.0, // Speed of the scrolling text
  blankSpace: 20.0, // Space between the end of the text and the start of the next loop
  startPadding: 10.0, // Padding at the start of the marquee
  pauseAfterRound: Duration(seconds: 1), // Pause after each round
  numberOfRounds: 3, // Number of times to scroll
),
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Optimizations

- **Performance**: If you are using a long text, consider adjusting the `velocity` and `blankSpace` properties to ensure smooth scrolling without performance issues.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure that the text is readable and does not scroll too fast for users with visual impairments.

By following these steps, you can easily integrate the `marquee_text` package into your Flutter application and create engaging scrolling text effects.

# Complete Example of Using the Marquee Text Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:marquee_text/marquee_text.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Marquee Text Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Marquee Text Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: MarqueeText(
            text: Text(
              'Welcome to RealFlutter! Enjoy scrolling text effects.',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
            ),
            scrollAxis: Axis.horizontal, // Set the scrolling direction to horizontal
            velocity: 50.0, // Set the speed of the scrolling text
            blankSpace: 20.0, // Space between the end of the text and the start of the next loop
            startPadding: 10.0, // Padding at the start of the marquee
            pauseAfterRound: Duration(seconds: 1), // Pause after each round
            numberOfRounds: 3, // Number of times to scroll
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Marquee Text Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers the MarqueeText widget.
// 5. The MarqueeText widget displays a scrolling text message with specified properties:
//    - The text is styled with a font size of 24 and bold weight.
//    - The text scrolls horizontally at a velocity of 50.0.
//    - There is a blank space of 20.0 between the end of the text and the start of the next loop.
//    - The scrolling starts with a padding of 10.0.
//    - The text pauses for 1 second after each round and scrolls a total of 3 times.
