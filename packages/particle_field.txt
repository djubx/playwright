# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Particle Field Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **particle_field** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **particle_field** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  particle_field: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to create a particle field.

# Complete Example of Using the Particle Field Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:particle_field/particle_field.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Particle Field Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Particle Field Demo'),
        ),
        body: ParticleFieldWidget(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class ParticleFieldWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ParticleFieldWidgetState createState() => _ParticleFieldWidgetState();
}

class _ParticleFieldWidgetState extends State<ParticleFieldWidget> {
  // Initialize the particle field with desired properties
  late ParticleField particleField;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    particleField = ParticleField(
      particleCount: 100, // Number of particles
      speed: 100, // Speed of particles
      size: 5, // Size of particles
      color: Colors.blue, // Color of particles
      lifespan: 2, // Lifespan of particles in seconds
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(
      child: GestureDetector(
        onTap: () {
          // Trigger particle effect on tap
          particleField.start();
        },
        child: Container(
          width: double.infinity,
          height: double.infinity,
          child: particleField,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget.
// 3. The home widget is a Scaffold containing an AppBar and the ParticleFieldWidget.
// 4. In ParticleFieldWidget, we initialize the ParticleField with specific properties in initState.
// 5. The build method creates a GestureDetector that listens for tap events.
// 6. When the user taps the screen, the particle effect starts, displaying particles on the screen.
```
