# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Vector Graphics Codec Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `vector_graphics_codec` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `vector_graphics_codec` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  vector_graphics_codec: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/vector_graphics_codec).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` if you are loading graphics from the internet. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to load and display a vector graphic.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:vector_graphics_codec/vector_graphics_codec.dart';
```

2. Create a widget to display the vector graphic:

```dart
class VectorGraphicWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return FutureBuilder<Picture>(
      future: loadVectorGraphic('assets/your_vector_file.svg'), // Load your SVG file
      builder: (context, snapshot) {
        if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
          return CircularProgressIndicator(); // Show loading indicator
        } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
          return Text('Error loading graphic'); // Handle error
        } else {
          return CustomPaint(
            size: Size(200, 200), // Set the size of the graphic
            painter: VectorPainter(snapshot.data!), // Use the loaded graphic
          );
        }
      },
    );
  }
}
```

3. Finally, use the `VectorGraphicWidget` in your main application widget.

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Vector Graphics Example')),
        body: Center(child: VectorGraphicWidget()), // Display the vector graphic
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

With these steps, you have successfully set up and used the `vector_graphics_codec` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using Vector Graphics Codec

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:vector_graphics_codec/vector_graphics_codec.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp()); // Start the application
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Vector Graphics Example')), // App bar title
        body: Center(child: VectorGraphicWidget()), // Center the vector graphic widget
      ),
    );
  }
}

class VectorGraphicWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return FutureBuilder<Picture>(
      future: loadVectorGraphic('assets/your_vector_file.svg'), // Load the SVG file
      builder: (context, snapshot) {
        if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
          return CircularProgressIndicator(); // Show loading indicator while waiting
        } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
          return Text('Error loading graphic'); // Display error message if loading fails
        } else {
          return CustomPaint(
            size: Size(200, 200), // Set the size for the graphic
            painter: VectorPainter(snapshot.data!), // Use the loaded vector graphic
          );
        }
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a centered VectorGraphicWidget.
// 3. VectorGraphicWidget uses a FutureBuilder to load a vector graphic asynchronously.
// 4. While the graphic is loading, a CircularProgressIndicator is displayed.
// 5. If the graphic loads successfully, it is rendered using CustomPaint with a VectorPainter.
// 6. If there is an error during loading, an error message is displayed.
```
