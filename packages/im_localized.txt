- You need a simple and efficient way to manage translations.
- You are looking for a package that integrates seamlessly with Flutter's existing localization features.

## Key Features
- **Easy Setup**: Quick integration into your Flutter project with minimal configuration.
- **Dynamic Language Switching**: Change languages at runtime without restarting the app.
- **Support for JSON Files**: Load translations from JSON files, making it easy to manage and update translations.

# Setting Up and Using im_localized

## Installation

To add the `im_localized` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  im_localized: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the correct configurations. Typically, no additional setup is required for localization, but make sure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21.

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add localization support in your `Info.plist` file. Add the following key-value pairs for each language you want to support:

```xml
<key>CFBundleLocalizations</key>
<array>
    <string>en</string>
    <string>es</string>
</array>
```

## Basic Usage

1. **Create JSON Files for Translations**: Create a folder named `assets/locales` and add your translation files, e.g., `en.json` and `es.json`.

   **en.json**
   ```json
   {
     "title": "Hello World",
     "message": "Welcome to the Flutter app!"
   }
   ```

   **es.json**
   ```json
   {
     "title": "Hola Mundo",
     "message": "¡Bienvenido a la aplicación Flutter!"
   }
   ```

2. **Initialize the Package**: In your main application file, initialize the localization package.

3. **Use the Localized Strings**: Access the localized strings in your widgets.

With these steps, you can easily set up and start using the `im_localized` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of im_localized in a Flutter App

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:im_localized/im_localized.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Initialize the localization package
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Localization Example',
      // Set the supported locales
      supportedLocales: [
        Locale('en', ''), // English
        Locale('es', ''), // Spanish
      ],
      // Define the localization delegates
      localizationsDelegates: [
        ImLocalized.delegate,
        GlobalMaterialLocalizations.delegate,
        GlobalWidgetsLocalizations.delegate,
        GlobalCupertinoLocalizations.delegate,
      ],
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  // Variable to hold the current locale
  Locale _currentLocale = Locale('en', '');

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Localization Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display localized title
            Text(
              ImLocalized.of(context).translate('title'),
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Display localized message
            Text(
              ImLocalized.of(context).translate('message'),
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to switch language
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Toggle between English and Spanish
                setState(() {
                  _currentLocale = _currentLocale.languageCode == 'en'
                      ? Locale('es', '')
                      : Locale('en', '');
                });
                // Update the locale in the localization package
                ImLocalized.of(context).setLocale(_currentLocale);
              },
              child: Text('Switch Language'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget initializes the MaterialApp with supported locales and localization delegates.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is displayed, which contains a title and message that are localized.
// 4. The user can switch between English and Spanish by pressing the button, which updates the current locale.
// 5. The localized strings are fetched using ImLocalized.of(context).translate() method, ensuring the correct language is displayed.
