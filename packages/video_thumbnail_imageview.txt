# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Video Thumbnail ImageView Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `video_thumbnail_imageview` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  video_thumbnail_imageview: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21  // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Ensure you have the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to display video thumbnails.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to capture videos.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to display a video thumbnail.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:video_thumbnail_imageview/video_thumbnail_imageview.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Video Thumbnail Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: VideoThumbnailImageView(
            videoUrl: 'https://www.example.com/video.mp4', // Replace with your video URL
            width: 300,
            height: 200,
            fit: BoxFit.cover,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that displays a video thumbnail from a specified URL. The `VideoThumbnailImageView` widget takes care of generating and displaying the thumbnail.

# Complete Example of Video Thumbnail ImageView

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:video_thumbnail_imageview/video_thumbnail_imageview.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Video Thumbnail Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Center widget to align the thumbnail in the middle of the screen
          child: VideoThumbnailImageView(
            videoUrl: 'https://www.example.com/video.mp4', // URL of the video
            width: 300, // Width of the thumbnail
            height: 200, // Height of the thumbnail
            fit: BoxFit.cover, // How the thumbnail should be fitted
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Entry point of the application
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the Flutter application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the UI.
// 3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// 4. The AppBar displays the title of the application.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 6. The VideoThumbnailImageView widget is used to display the thumbnail of the video.
// 7. The videoUrl property is set to the URL of the video from which the thumbnail will be generated.
// 8. The width and height properties define the size of the thumbnail, and fit determines how the thumbnail is displayed within the given dimensions.
```
