# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the WordPress Client Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `wordpress_client` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  wordpress_client: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    compileSdkVersion 31  // Use the latest stable version
    ...
}
```

2. Ensure you have internet permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following lines to allow network requests:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to initialize the client and fetch posts from a WordPress site.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:wordpress_client/wordpress_client.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  final WordPressClient client;

  RealFlutter() : client = WordPressClient('https://yourwordpresssite.com/wp-json/');

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('WordPress Client Example')),
        body: FutureBuilder<List<Post>>(
          future: client.getPosts(),
          builder: (context, snapshot) {
            if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
              return Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
            } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
              return Center(child: Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}'));
            } else {
              final posts = snapshot.data!;
              return ListView.builder(
                itemCount: posts.length,
                itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                  return ListTile(
                    title: Text(posts[index].title.rendered),
                    subtitle: Text(posts[index].excerpt.rendered),
                  );
                },
              );
            }
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize the `WordPressClient` with the base URL of the WordPress REST API. We then use a `FutureBuilder` to fetch and display posts.

# Complete Example: WordPress Client in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:wordpress_client/wordpress_client.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  // Initialize the WordPress client with the base URL of your WordPress site
  final WordPressClient client;

  RealFlutter() : client = WordPressClient('https://yourwordpresssite.com/wp-json/');

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('WordPress Client Example')),
        body: FutureBuilder<List<Post>>(
          // Fetch posts from the WordPress site
          future: client.getPosts(),
          builder: (context, snapshot) {
            // Show a loading indicator while waiting for data
            if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
              return Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
            } 
            // Handle errors if any occur during the fetch
            else if (snapshot.hasError) {
              return Center(child: Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}'));
            } 
            // If data is successfully fetched, display the posts
            else {
              final posts = snapshot.data!;
              return ListView.builder(
                itemCount: posts.length,
                itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                  // Display each post's title and excerpt
                  return ListTile(
                    title: Text(posts[index].title.rendered),
                    subtitle: Text(posts[index].excerpt.rendered),
                  );
                },
              );
            }
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation

// The application starts by initializing the `RealFlutter` class, which sets up the WordPress client with the base URL of the WordPress REST API.
// In the `build` method, a `MaterialApp` is created with a `Scaffold` containing an `AppBar` and a `FutureBuilder`.
// The `FutureBuilder` is used to fetch posts from the WordPress site asynchronously.
// While the data is being fetched, a loading indicator is displayed.
// If an error occurs during the fetch, an error message is shown.
// Once the data is successfully fetched, a `ListView` is built to display the titles and excerpts of the posts.
// Each post is represented as a `ListTile` in the list, showing the title and excerpt of the post.
// Finally, the `main` function runs the app by calling `runApp` with the `RealFlutter` widget.
