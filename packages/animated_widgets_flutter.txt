```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_widgets_flutter/animated_widgets_flutter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  bool _isButtonPressed = false;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Animated button
            AnimatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                setState(() {
                  _isButtonPressed = true;
                });
              },
              child: Text('Click me!'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Animated container
            AnimatedContainer(
              width: _isButtonPressed ? 200 : 100,
              height: _isButtonPressed ? 200 : 100,
              color: _isButtonPressed ? Colors.blue : Colors.red,
              duration: Duration(milliseconds: 500),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Animated text
            AnimatedText(
              text: _isButtonPressed ? 'Button pressed!' : 'Click the button',
              duration: Duration(milliseconds: 500),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application flow:
// 1. The user clicks the animated button.
// 2. The button press sets the `_isButtonPressed` flag to true.
// 3. The animated container and text widgets are updated based on the `_isButtonPressed` flag.
// 4. The animated container changes its size and color.
// 5. The animated text changes its text.
// 6. The animations are performed over a duration of 500 milliseconds.

// Final summary:
// The code demonstrates the use of the `animated_widgets_flutter` package to create animated widgets in a Flutter app. The app includes an animated button, container, and text widgets that are updated based on the button press. The animations are performed over a duration of 500 milliseconds.
