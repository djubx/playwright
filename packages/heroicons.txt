# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Heroicons in Flutter

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the Heroicons package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  heroicons: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the icons, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:heroicons/heroicons.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using Heroicons

You can now use Heroicons in your Flutter widgets. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use an icon:

```dart
HeroIcon(
  HeroIcons.home, // Specify the icon you want to use
  size: 24.0, // Set the size of the icon
  color: Colors.blue, // Set the color of the icon
)
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Optimizations

- **Performance**: Since Heroicons are SVGs, they are lightweight and do not significantly impact the performance of your app.
- **Caching**: Consider using caching strategies for icons if you are using them extensively in your app to improve performance.

With these steps, you should be able to successfully integrate and use the Heroicons package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using Heroicons in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:heroicons/heroicons.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Heroicons Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Heroicons in Flutter'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Displaying a home icon
            HeroIcon(
              HeroIcons.home, // Using the home icon
              size: 50.0, // Setting the size of the icon
              color: Colors.blue, // Setting the color of the icon
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
            // Displaying a settings icon
            HeroIcon(
              HeroIcons.cog, // Using the settings icon
              size: 50.0, // Setting the size of the icon
              color: Colors.green, // Setting the color of the icon
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
            // Displaying a user icon
            HeroIcon(
              HeroIcons.user, // Using the user icon
              size: 50.0, // Setting the size of the icon
              color: Colors.red, // Setting the color of the icon
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to HomeScreen, which is the main screen of the app.
// 4. In HomeScreen, a Scaffold widget is used to create the basic visual structure.
// 5. An AppBar is created with the title 'Heroicons in Flutter'.
// 6. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child widgets.
// 7. A Column widget is used to arrange the HeroIcons vertically.
// 8. Each HeroIcon is displayed with a specified size and color, showcasing different icons (home, settings, user).
// 9. SizedBox widgets are used to add spacing between the icons for better visual separation.
