# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Flex Seed Scheme

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **flex_seed_scheme** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **flex_seed_scheme** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flex_seed_scheme: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flex_seed_scheme).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    compileSdkVersion 31 // or latest version
    ...
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, ensure that your `ios/Podfile` has the following settings:

```ruby
platform :ios, '12.0' # or latest version
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a basic theme using the **flex_seed_scheme** package.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flex_seed_scheme/flex_seed_scheme.dart';
```

2. Create a `MaterialApp` with a theme that utilizes the **flex_seed_scheme**:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flex Seed Scheme Demo',
      theme: FlexSeedScheme.light(), // Use light theme
      darkTheme: FlexSeedScheme.dark(), // Use dark theme
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Create a simple `HomeScreen` widget to demonstrate the theme:

```dart
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flex Seed Scheme Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Hello, Flex Seed Scheme!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

With these steps, you have successfully set up and used the **flex_seed_scheme** package in your Flutter application. You can now customize the themes further based on your requirements.

# Complete Example of Flex Seed Scheme

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart'; // Import Flutter material package
import 'package:flex_seed_scheme/flex_seed_scheme.dart'; // Import flex_seed_scheme package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flex Seed Scheme Demo', // Title of the app
      theme: FlexSeedScheme.light(), // Set light theme
      darkTheme: FlexSeedScheme.dark(), // Set dark theme
      home: HomeScreen(), // Set the home screen
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flex Seed Scheme Example'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center, // Center the column
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Hello, Flex Seed Scheme!', // Display greeting text
              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline4, // Use theme text style
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Add space between text and button
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action when button is pressed
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Button Pressed!')), // Show snackbar
                );
              },
              child: Text('Press Me'), // Button text
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with light and dark themes using FlexSeedScheme.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is displayed as the home screen of the app.
// 4. The HomeScreen contains an AppBar with a title and a centered column.
// 5. The column has a greeting text and a button.
// 6. When the button is pressed, a snackbar appears with a message.
```
