# Tutorial: Using the Flutter Widget Function Package
=====================================================

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

To use the `flutter_widget_function` package, you need to add it to your project's `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line:

```yml
dependencies:
  flutter_widget_function: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_widget_function/flutter_widget_function.dart';
```

### Step 3: Create a Custom Widget

To create a custom widget, you need to create a new class that extends `WidgetFunction`. For example:

```dart
class CustomWidget extends WidgetFunction {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      child: Text('Hello, World!'),
    );
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Use the Custom Widget

To use the custom widget, you can call the `build` method:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return CustomWidget().build(context);
  }
}
```

### Platform-Specific Details

The `flutter_widget_function` package works on both Android and iOS platforms. However, you may need to configure your project settings to use the package.

### Required Configurations or Optimizations

There are no required configurations or optimizations for using the `flutter_widget_function` package. However, you may want to consider optimizing your widget tree for better performance.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_widget_function/flutter_widget_function.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Widget Function Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  // Step 1: Create a custom widget
  CustomWidget customWidget = CustomWidget();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Step 2: Use the custom widget
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Widget Function Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: customWidget.build(context),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class CustomWidget extends WidgetFunction {
  // Step 3: Define the custom widget's build method
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Step 4: Return the custom widget's UI
    return Container(
      child: Text('Hello, World!'),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app.
// 2. The app's main function is called, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 3. The MyApp widget builds the app's UI, including the RealFlutter widget.
// 4. The RealFlutter widget creates a custom widget and uses its build method to get the custom widget's UI.
// 5. The custom widget's build method returns the custom widget's UI, which is then displayed to the user.
