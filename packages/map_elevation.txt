# Overview of the map_elevation Flutter Package

The `map_elevation` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to integrate elevation data into their applications. This package allows you to visualize and interact with elevation maps, making it ideal for applications related to outdoor activities, geography, and urban planning. 

## When to Use This Package
- **Outdoor Navigation Apps**: If you're building an app that helps users navigate through hilly or mountainous terrains, this package can provide crucial elevation data.
- **Fitness Tracking**: For fitness applications that track running or cycling routes, knowing the elevation can help users understand the difficulty of their routes.
- **Geographical Analysis**: If your app involves geographical data analysis, integrating elevation maps can enhance the user experience.

## Key Features
- **Elevation Data Retrieval**: Fetch elevation data for specific geographical coordinates.
- **Customizable Map Styles**: Modify the appearance of the elevation maps to fit your app's theme.
- **Interactive UI**: Users can interact with the map to get detailed elevation information at specific points.

Overall, the `map_elevation` package is a versatile tool for any Flutter developer looking to incorporate elevation data into their applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the map_elevation Package

## Installation
To get started with the `map_elevation` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  map_elevation: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request location permissions:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show elevation data.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show elevation data.</string>
```

## Using the Package
To use the `map_elevation` package, you can create a simple Flutter widget that displays an elevation map. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:map_elevation/map_elevation.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Elevation Map Example')),
        body: ElevationMap(
          latitude: 37.7749, // Example latitude
          longitude: -122.4194, // Example longitude
          onElevationChanged: (elevation) {
            print('Elevation: $elevation meters');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application that displays an elevation map centered on San Francisco, California. The `onElevationChanged` callback allows you to respond to elevation changes interactively.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the `map_elevation` package into your Flutter application successfully.

# Complete Example of Using the map_elevation Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:map_elevation/map_elevation.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Elevation Map Example')),
        body: ElevationMap(
          latitude: 37.7749, // Set the latitude for the map
          longitude: -122.4194, // Set the longitude for the map
          onElevationChanged: (elevation) {
            // Callback to handle elevation changes
            print('Elevation: $elevation meters'); // Print the elevation to the console
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and an ElevationMap widget.
// 3. The ElevationMap widget is initialized with specific latitude and longitude values.
// 4. When the user interacts with the map, the onElevationChanged callback is triggered, printing the current elevation to the console.
// 5. This allows users to see real-time elevation data as they explore the map.
