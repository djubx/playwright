# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Chat Bottom Container

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `chat_bottom_container` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  chat_bottom_container: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `chat_bottom_container` in your app.

# Complete Example of Using Chat Bottom Container

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:chat_bottom_container/chat_bottom_container.dart'; // Import the package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the main app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Chat Bottom Container Example',
      home: ChatScreen(), // Navigate to the chat screen
    );
  }
}

class ChatScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ChatScreenState createState() => _ChatScreenState();
}

class _ChatScreenState extends State<ChatScreen> {
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController(); // Controller for the text input
  List<String> messages = []; // List to hold chat messages

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Chat Screen'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          Expanded(
            child: ListView.builder(
              itemCount: messages.length, // Count of messages
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text(messages[index]), // Display each message
                );
              },
            ),
          ),
          // Chat bottom container
          ChatBottomContainer(
            controller: _controller, // Text editing controller
            onSend: () {
              if (_controller.text.isNotEmpty) {
                setState(() {
                  messages.add(_controller.text); // Add message to the list
                  _controller.clear(); // Clear the input field
                });
              }
            },
            // Optional: Add more customization here
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (ChatScreen).
// 3. ChatScreen is a stateful widget that maintains a list of messages and a text controller.
// 4. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Column containing a ListView and the ChatBottomContainer.
// 5. The ListView displays the messages, and the ChatBottomContainer allows users to input and send messages.
// 6. When the send button is pressed, the message is added to the list, and the input field is cleared.
```

// Final Summary:
// The code demonstrates a simple chat application using the `chat_bottom_container` package. It initializes a list of messages and a text controller. The user can type messages in the input field provided by the ChatBottomContainer, and upon pressing the send button, the message is added to the list and displayed in the ListView. The application is structured to allow easy customization and expansion for additional features, such as emoji support or file attachments.
