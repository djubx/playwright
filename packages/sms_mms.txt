# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the SMS_MMS Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `sms_mms` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  sms_mms: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/sms_mms).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SEND_SMS"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_SMS"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_SMS"/>
```

2. If you are targeting Android 6.0 (API level 23) or higher, you will need to request runtime permissions for sending and receiving SMS.

### iOS Configuration
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to send images via MMS.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to send images via MMS.</string>
<key>NSContactsUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your contacts to send SMS to them.</string>
```

2. Note that iOS has stricter policies regarding SMS and MMS, and you may need to handle user permissions carefully.

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to send an SMS and receive incoming messages.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sms_mms/sms_mms.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  final SmsMms _smsMms = SmsMms();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Listen for incoming messages
    _smsMms.onSmsReceived.listen((SmsMessage message) {
      // Handle incoming SMS
      print('Received SMS: ${message.body}');
    });
  }

  void _sendSms() async {
    // Sending an SMS
    await _smsMms.sendSms('1234567890', 'Hello from RealFlutter!');
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('SMS/MMS Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _sendSms,
          child: Text('Send SMS'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that sends an SMS when a button is pressed and listens for incoming messages.

# Complete Example of SMS_MMS Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sms_mms/sms_mms.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  final SmsMms _smsMms = SmsMms(); // Create an instance of SmsMms

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Listen for incoming messages
    _smsMms.onSmsReceived.listen((SmsMessage message) {
      // Handle incoming SMS
      print('Received SMS: ${message.body}'); // Print the received message
    });
  }

  void _sendSms() async {
    // Sending an SMS
    await _smsMms.sendSms('1234567890', 'Hello from RealFlutter!'); // Replace with a valid number
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('SMS/MMS Example')), // App bar title
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _sendSms, // Call _sendSms when button is pressed
          child: Text('Send SMS'), // Button text
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the initState method, we set up a listener for incoming SMS messages.
// 3. When an SMS is received, it is printed to the console.
// 4. The UI consists of a button that, when pressed, triggers the _sendSms method.
// 5. The _sendSms method sends an SMS to the specified number with a predefined message.
// 6. The user can see the SMS being sent and any incoming messages in the console.
