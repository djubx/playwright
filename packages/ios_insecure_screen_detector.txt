Hereâ€™s a detailed technical blog on the `ios_insecure_screen_detector` Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# iOS Insecure Screen Detector Flutter Package

The `ios_insecure_screen_detector` is a Flutter package designed to help developers detect when their application is being displayed on an insecure screen, such as a screen recording or screen mirroring. This is particularly important for applications that handle sensitive information, such as banking apps or personal data applications, where privacy and security are paramount.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `ios_insecure_screen_detector` package in scenarios such as:

- **Banking Applications**: To prevent sensitive information from being captured during screen sharing or recording.
- **Messaging Apps**: To protect private conversations from being exposed.
- **Healthcare Applications**: To ensure patient data is not displayed on insecure screens.

## Features

- **Real-time Detection**: The package provides real-time detection of insecure screens.
- **Platform-Specific Support**: While primarily focused on iOS, it can be integrated into Flutter applications that target both iOS and Android.
- **Customizable Callbacks**: Developers can define custom actions when an insecure screen is detected.

By integrating this package, developers can enhance the security of their applications and protect user data from potential leaks.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the iOS Insecure Screen Detector

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `ios_insecure_screen_detector` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ios_insecure_screen_detector: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: You need to add the following key to your `Info.plist` file to request permission for screen recording detection:

   ```xml
   <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
   <string>This app requires access to the microphone for detecting screen recording.</string>
   ```

2. **Enable Background Modes**: If you want to detect screen recording while the app is in the background, enable the "Audio, AirPlay, and Picture in Picture" background mode in your Xcode project settings.

### Android Configuration

Currently, this package is primarily focused on iOS. However, you can still use it in a Flutter project targeting Android, but the detection features will not be available.

## Step 3: Using the Package

To use the `ios_insecure_screen_detector`, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:ios_insecure_screen_detector/ios_insecure_screen_detector.dart';
```

You can then initialize the detector and set up your callbacks:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: InsecureScreenExample(),
    );
  }
}

class InsecureScreenExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _InsecureScreenExampleState createState() => _InsecureScreenExampleState();
}

class _InsecureScreenExampleState extends State<InsecureScreenExample> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the detector
    InsecureScreenDetector.startDetection(
      onInsecureScreenDetected: () {
        // Handle the event when an insecure screen is detected
        print("Insecure screen detected!");
      },
      onSecureScreenDetected: () {
        // Handle the event when a secure screen is detected
        print("Secure screen detected!");
      },
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Stop detection when the widget is disposed
    InsecureScreenDetector.stopDetection();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Insecure Screen Detector")),
      body: Center(child: Text("Monitoring for insecure screens...")),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we set up the `InsecureScreenDetector` to monitor for insecure screens and print messages to the console when a change is detected.

# Complete Example of Using the iOS Insecure Screen Detector

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ios_insecure_screen_detector/ios_insecure_screen_detector.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: InsecureScreenExample(),
    );
  }
}

class InsecureScreenExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _InsecureScreenExampleState createState() => _InsecureScreenExampleState();
}

class _InsecureScreenExampleState extends State<InsecureScreenExample> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Start detecting insecure screens
    InsecureScreenDetector.startDetection(
      onInsecureScreenDetected: () {
        // This callback is triggered when an insecure screen is detected
        print("Insecure screen detected! Taking action...");
        // Here you can add logic to handle the insecure screen event
      },
      onSecureScreenDetected: () {
        // This callback is triggered when a secure screen is detected
        print("Secure screen detected! All good.");
      },
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Stop detecting when the widget is disposed
    InsecureScreenDetector.stopDetection();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Insecure Screen Detector")),
      body: Center(
        child: Text("Monitoring for insecure screens..."),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds the InsecureScreenExample widget as the home screen.
// 3. InsecureScreenExample initializes the InsecureScreenDetector in its initState method.
// 4. The detector starts monitoring for insecure screens, triggering callbacks when the screen state changes.
// 5. If an insecure screen is detected, a message is printed to the console, and you can implement additional logic.
// 6. When the widget is disposed, the detector stops monitoring to prevent memory leaks.
```
