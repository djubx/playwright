# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the s3_storage Package

## Installation
To get started with the `s3_storage` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  s3_storage: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/s3_storage).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // or higher
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to upload images.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to take photos.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `s3_storage` package, you need to initialize it with your AWS credentials and bucket information. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to upload a file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:s3_storage/s3_storage.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('S3 Storage Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initialize S3 storage
              final s3 = S3Storage(
                bucket: 'your-bucket-name',
                region: 'your-region',
                accessKey: 'your-access-key',
                secretKey: 'your-secret-key',
              );

              // Upload a file
              final result = await s3.uploadFile('path/to/your/file.jpg');
              print('Upload result: $result');
            },
            child: Text('Upload File'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code initializes the S3 storage with your credentials and allows you to upload a file when the button is pressed.

# Complete Example of Using s3_storage

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:s3_storage/s3_storage.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('S3 Storage Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initialize S3 storage with your AWS credentials
              final s3 = S3Storage(
                bucket: 'your-bucket-name', // Specify your S3 bucket name
                region: 'your-region', // Specify the AWS region
                accessKey: 'your-access-key', // Your AWS access key
                secretKey: 'your-secret-key', // Your AWS secret key
              );

              // Upload a file to the S3 bucket
              final result = await s3.uploadFile('path/to/your/file.jpg');
              // Print the result of the upload operation
              print('Upload result: $result');

              // Download a file from the S3 bucket
              final downloadResult = await s3.downloadFile('file.jpg', 'path/to/save/file.jpg');
              // Print the result of the download operation
              print('Download result: $downloadResult');

              // List files in the S3 bucket
              final files = await s3.listFiles();
              // Print the list of files
              print('Files in bucket: $files');
            },
            child: Text('Upload and Download File'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with a MaterialApp and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 2. An ElevatedButton is displayed in the center of the screen.
// 3. When the button is pressed, the S3Storage instance is initialized with the required AWS credentials.
// 4. The app attempts to upload a specified file to the S3 bucket and prints the result.
// 5. It then downloads a file from the S3 bucket and prints the download result.
// 6. Finally, it lists all files in the S3 bucket and prints them to the console.
