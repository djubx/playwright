# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Glassmorphism UI Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the **glassmorphism_ui** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  glassmorphism_ui: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/glassmorphism_ui).

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### For Android
Ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version should be 21 or higher
    }
}
```

### For iOS
In your `ios/Runner/Info.plist`, add the following key to enable the use of blur effects:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>audio</string>
    <string>fetch</string>
    <string>remote-notification</string>
</array>
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:glassmorphism_ui/glassmorphism_ui.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Glassmorphism Widget
You can now use the `GlassContainer` widget provided by the package to create a glassmorphism effect. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
GlassContainer(
  height: 200,
  width: 300,
  blur: 20,
  borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(15),
  child: Center(child: Text('Hello, Glassmorphism!')),
)
```

This widget creates a container with a frosted glass effect, which you can customize further.

# Complete Example of Using the Glassmorphism UI Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:glassmorphism_ui/glassmorphism_ui.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Glassmorphism UI Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Glassmorphism UI Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: GlassContainer(
            height: 300, // Set the height of the glass container
            width: 300, // Set the width of the glass container
            blur: 20, // Set the blur intensity
            borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(15), // Set the border radius
            child: Center(
              child: Text(
                'Hello, Glassmorphism!',
                style: TextStyle(
                  fontSize: 24,
                  color: Colors.white, // Text color
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home scaffold.
// 3. The scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Glassmorphism UI Example'.
// 4. The body of the scaffold centers a GlassContainer widget.
// 5. The GlassContainer has a specified height and width, a blur effect, and rounded corners.
// 6. Inside the GlassContainer, a centered Text widget displays 'Hello, Glassmorphism!' with white color.
// 7. The overall effect creates a visually appealing glassmorphism design in the application.
```
