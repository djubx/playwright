# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Syncfusion Flutter Gauges

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `syncfusion_flutter_gauges` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  syncfusion_flutter_gauges: ^20.1.55
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Open the `Podfile` and uncomment the platform line, setting it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:syncfusion_flutter_gauges/gauges.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Gauges

You can now use the gauges in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to create a radial gauge.

```dart
SfRadialGauge(
  axes: <RadialAxis>[
    RadialAxis(
      minimum: 0,
      maximum: 100,
      ranges: <GaugeRange>[
        GaugeRange(startValue: 0, endValue: 50, color: Colors.red),
        GaugeRange(startValue: 50, endValue: 100, color: Colors.green),
      ],
      pointers: <GaugePointer>[
        NeedlePointer(value: 75),
      ],
      annotations: <GaugeAnnotation>[
        GaugeAnnotation(
          widget: Container(
            child: Text('75%', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 25, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold)),
          ),
          angle: 90,
          positionFactor: 0.5,
        ),
      ],
    )
  ],
)
```

This code creates a radial gauge with a range from 0 to 100, where the needle points to 75%. The gauge is divided into two color ranges: red for values 0-50 and green for values 50-100.

With these steps, you can easily set up and use the `syncfusion_flutter_gauges` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Syncfusion Flutter Gauges

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:syncfusion_flutter_gauges/gauges.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Syncfusion Flutter Gauges Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Syncfusion Flutter Gauges'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: SfRadialGauge(
            axes: <RadialAxis>[
              RadialAxis(
                minimum: 0, // Minimum value of the gauge
                maximum: 100, // Maximum value of the gauge
                ranges: <GaugeRange>[
                  GaugeRange(
                    startValue: 0, // Start of the range
                    endValue: 50, // End of the range
                    color: Colors.red, // Color for the range
                  ),
                  GaugeRange(
                    startValue: 50, // Start of the range
                    endValue: 100, // End of the range
                    color: Colors.green, // Color for the range
                  ),
                ],
                pointers: <GaugePointer>[
                  NeedlePointer(value: 75), // Needle pointer value
                ],
                annotations: <GaugeAnnotation>[
                  GaugeAnnotation(
                    widget: Container(
                      child: Text(
                        '75%', // Displayed text
                        style: TextStyle(fontSize: 25, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
                      ),
                    ),
                    angle: 90, // Angle of the annotation
                    positionFactor: 0.5, // Position factor for the annotation
                  ),
                ],
              )
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Syncfusion Flutter Gauges'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a radial gauge created using SfRadialGauge.
// 5. The radial gauge has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 100.
// 6. Two ranges are defined: a red range from 0 to 50 and a green range from 50 to 100.
// 7. A needle pointer is set to 75, indicating the current value.
// 8. An annotation displays '75%' at the top of the gauge, providing a clear visual representation of the value.
