  putLumberdashToWork(withClients: [ColorizeLumberdash()]);
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

No additional configuration is required for Android. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21.

### iOS

Ensure your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

# Complete Example of Using `colorize_lumberdash`

Below is a complete example demonstrating how to use the `colorize_lumberdash` package in a Flutter application.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:colorize_lumberdash/colorize_lumberdash.dart';
import 'package:lumberdash/lumberdash.dart';

// Main entry point of the application
void main() {
  // Initialize the colorize lumberdash logger
  putLumberdashToWork(withClients: [ColorizeLumberdash()]);
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Main application widget
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Log an info message
    logMessage('RealFlutter app started');

    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Colorize Lumberdash Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Colorize Lumberdash Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Log a warning message when the button is pressed
              logWarning('Button was pressed!');
            },
            child: Text('Press Me'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// Application Flow Explanation
// 1. The `main` function is the entry point of the Flutter application.
// 2. `putLumberdashToWork` is called to initialize the logging system with `ColorizeLumberdash`.
// 3. The `RealFlutter` widget is the root of the application, which is a stateless widget.
// 4. Inside `RealFlutter`, a `MaterialApp` is created with a simple UI containing an `AppBar` and a button.
// 5. When the button is pressed, a warning log is generated using `logWarning`.
// 6. The logs are colorized based on their severity, making it easy to identify them in the console.
