# Gallery Flutter Package

The **Gallery** Flutter package is a powerful tool designed for developers who want to create visually appealing image galleries in their Flutter applications. It provides a simple and efficient way to display images in a grid or list format, complete with features like zooming, panning, and swiping between images. This package is particularly useful for applications that require a rich media experience, such as photography apps, e-commerce platforms, or social media applications.

## When to Use This Package
- When you need to display a collection of images in a visually appealing manner.
- For applications that require user interaction with images, such as zooming or swiping.
- When you want to implement a gallery feature without building it from scratch.

## Key Features
- **Grid and List Views**: Easily switch between grid and list layouts for displaying images.
- **Image Zooming**: Users can pinch to zoom in and out of images for a closer look.
- **Swipe Navigation**: Users can swipe between images for a seamless browsing experience.
- **Customizable**: Offers various customization options for layout, spacing, and image display.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Gallery Package

## Installation
To get started with the Gallery package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  gallery: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/gallery).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add permissions for accessing the photo library. Open your `Info.plist` file and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your photo library.</string>
```

## Using the Gallery Package
Once you have installed the package and configured your project, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the Gallery package.

# Complete Example of Using the Gallery Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gallery/gallery.dart'; // Import the gallery package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the main application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Gallery Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: GalleryScreen(), // Set the home screen to GalleryScreen
    );
  }
}

class GalleryScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  // Sample list of image URLs
  final List<String> imageUrls = [
    'https://example.com/image1.jpg',
    'https://example.com/image2.jpg',
    'https://example.com/image3.jpg',
    // Add more image URLs as needed
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Image Gallery'), // Title of the app bar
      ),
      body: Gallery(
        images: imageUrls, // Pass the list of image URLs to the Gallery widget
        gridDelegate: SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount(
          crossAxisCount: 2, // Number of columns in the grid
          childAspectRatio: 1, // Aspect ratio of each grid item
        ),
        onImageTap: (index) {
          // Handle image tap event
          Navigator.push(
            context,
            MaterialPageRoute(
              builder: (context) => ImageDetailScreen(imageUrls[index]),
            ),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

class ImageDetailScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final String imageUrl;

  ImageDetailScreen(this.imageUrl); // Constructor to receive the image URL

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Image Detail'), // Title of the detail screen
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: GestureDetector(
          onTap: () {
            Navigator.pop(context); // Pop the detail screen on tap
          },
          child: Image.network(imageUrl), // Display the image
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
// The main function initializes the app and sets up the MaterialApp.
// The RealFlutter class is the root widget that builds the app's UI.
// The GalleryScreen class displays a grid of images using the Gallery package.
// The imageUrls list contains the URLs of the images to be displayed.
// The Gallery widget is configured with a grid layout and an onImageTap callback.
// When an image is tapped, it navigates to the ImageDetailScreen.
// The ImageDetailScreen class displays the selected image in full screen.
// Tapping on the image in the detail screen will return to the previous screen.
```
