# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using audio_helper

## Installation
To get started with the `audio_helper` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  audio_helper: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/audio_helper).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions to enable audio recording:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request permission for audio recording:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone to record audio.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save recordings.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
Once you have installed the package and configured the necessary permissions, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to play and record audio.

# Complete Example of audio_helper in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:audio_helper/audio_helper.dart'; // Import the audio_helper package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the main application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  AudioHelper audioHelper = AudioHelper(); // Create an instance of AudioHelper
  String audioFilePath = ''; // Variable to store the path of the audio file

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the audio helper
    audioHelper.init();
  }

  // Function to play audio
  void playAudio() async {
    await audioHelper.play('path_to_your_audio_file.mp3'); // Play the audio file
  }

  // Function to record audio
  void recordAudio() async {
    audioFilePath = await audioHelper.record(); // Start recording audio
    setState(() {}); // Update the UI after recording
  }

  // Function to stop recording
  void stopRecording() async {
    await audioHelper.stop(); // Stop the recording
    setState(() {}); // Update the UI after stopping
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Audio Helper Example')), // App bar title
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: playAudio, // Play audio on button press
                child: Text('Play Audio'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: recordAudio, // Start recording on button press
                child: Text('Record Audio'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: stopRecording, // Stop recording on button press
                child: Text('Stop Recording'),
              ),
              if (audioFilePath.isNotEmpty) // Display recorded file path if available
                Text('Recorded File: $audioFilePath'),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application using the audio_helper package.
// 1. The app initializes the AudioHelper instance in the initState method.
// 2. It provides three buttons: one for playing audio, one for recording audio, and one for stopping the recording.
// 3. When the "Play Audio" button is pressed, the app plays the specified audio file.
// 4. When the "Record Audio" button is pressed, it starts recording audio and stores the file path.
// 5. The "Stop Recording" button stops the recording process.
// 6. If an audio file has been recorded, its path is displayed on the screen.
