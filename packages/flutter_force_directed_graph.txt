# Flutter Force Directed Graph Package

The `flutter_force_directed_graph` package is a powerful tool for visualizing complex data structures in a graph format within Flutter applications. This package allows developers to create interactive force-directed graphs, which are particularly useful for representing relationships between data points, such as social networks, organizational structures, or any interconnected data.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the `flutter_force_directed_graph` package in scenarios such as:

- **Social Network Analysis**: Visualizing connections between users or entities.
- **Data Relationships**: Displaying how different data points relate to one another in a clear and interactive manner.
- **Organizational Charts**: Representing hierarchical structures within an organization.
- **Educational Tools**: Creating interactive learning materials that require visual representation of complex relationships.

## Features

- **Interactive Graphs**: Users can interact with the graph, dragging nodes and exploring connections.
- **Customizable Nodes and Edges**: Easily customize the appearance of nodes and edges to fit your application's design.
- **Dynamic Data Handling**: Update the graph dynamically as data changes, allowing for real-time visualizations.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

This package is an excellent choice for developers looking to add rich, interactive visualizations to their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_force_directed_graph

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_force_directed_graph` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_force_directed_graph` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_force_directed_graph: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_force_directed_graph).

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the platform version in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_force_directed_graph/flutter_force_directed_graph.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package

You can now use the `ForceDirectedGraph` widget in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement it.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_force_directed_graph/flutter_force_directed_graph.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Force Directed Graph Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Force Directed Graph'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ForceDirectedGraph(
            nodes: [
              Node(id: '1', label: 'Node 1'),
              Node(id: '2', label: 'Node 2'),
              Node(id: '3', label: 'Node 3'),
            ],
            edges: [
              Edge(source: '1', target: '2'),
              Edge(source: '2', target: '3'),
              Edge(source: '1', target: '3'),
            ],
            options: ForceDirectedGraphOptions(
              width: 400,
              height: 400,
              nodeColor: Colors.blue,
              edgeColor: Colors.grey,
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The above code sets up a simple Flutter application that displays a force-directed graph.
// 1. The main function initializes the app and runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, we create a ForceDirectedGraph widget.
// 4. We define three nodes and three edges connecting them.
// 5. The graph is displayed in a 400x400 area with specified colors for nodes and edges.
// 6. Users can interact with the graph, dragging nodes to explore connections.
