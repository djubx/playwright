## Features

- **Customizable Notifications**: Tailor the appearance and behavior of notifications to match your app's design.
- **Multiple Notification Types**: Support for various notification types, including success messages, error alerts, and informational prompts.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup process and straightforward API for quick implementation.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the In-App Notification Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `in_app_notification` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  in_app_notification: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following permissions if you plan to use notifications:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>fetch</string>
</array>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that the package is set up, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to display an in-app notification.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:in_app_notification/in_app_notification.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'In-App Notification Demo',
      home: NotificationDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class NotificationDemo extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('In-App Notification Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Show a success notification
            InAppNotification.show(
              context: context,
              title: 'Success!',
              message: 'Your action was successful.',
              type: NotificationType.success,
            );
          },
          child: Text('Show Notification'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, a success notification will appear at the top of the screen.

# Complete Example of In-App Notification

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:in_app_notification/in_app_notification.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'In-App Notification Demo',
      home: NotificationDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class NotificationDemo extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('In-App Notification Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Show a success notification when the button is pressed
            InAppNotification.show(
              context: context,
              title: 'Success!',
              message: 'Your action was successful.',
              type: NotificationType.success,
            );
          },
          child: Text('Show Notification'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds the MaterialApp widget, setting the title and home to NotificationDemo.
// 3. NotificationDemo creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the InAppNotification.show() method is called.
// 6. This method displays a success notification at the top of the screen with a title and message.
// 7. The user sees the notification without leaving the current screen, enhancing the user experience.
