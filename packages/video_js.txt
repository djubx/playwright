Setting Up the video_js Package

To use the video_js package, follow these steps:

1. Add the package to your pubspec.yaml file:

Configuring the Video Player

VideoJs(
  src: 'https://example.com/video.mp4',
  controls: true,
  autoplay: false,
  width: 300,
  height: 200,
)
```
This will create a video player with controls and a width and height of 300x200 pixels.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:video_js/video_js.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Create a VideoJs widget with a video source
  VideoJs _videoJs = VideoJs(
    src: 'https://example.com/video.mp4',
    controls: true,
    autoplay: false,
    width: 300,
    height: 200,
  );

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Video.js Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Video.js Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: _videoJs,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and the RealFlutter widget is created.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget creates a VideoJs widget with a video source.
// 3. The VideoJs widget is displayed in the center of the screen.
// 4. The user can interact with the video player by tapping on the controls.
// 5. The video player will play, pause, and seek accordingly.
```

// In summary, the code flows as follows: the RealFlutter widget is created, which in turn creates a VideoJs widget with a video source. The VideoJs widget is then displayed in the center of the screen, allowing the user to interact with the video player. The video player will play, pause, and seek accordingly based on the user's input.
