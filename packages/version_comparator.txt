# Version Comparator Flutter Package

The `version_comparator` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that allows for easy comparison of version strings. This package is particularly useful when you need to manage dependencies, check for updates, or enforce version constraints in your applications. 

## When to Use

You might want to use the `version_comparator` package in scenarios such as:
- **Dependency Management**: When you need to ensure that your app is using compatible versions of libraries.
- **Update Checks**: To determine if a newer version of your app is available on the app store.
- **Feature Flags**: To enable or disable features based on the version of the app.

## Features

- **Simple API**: The package provides a straightforward API for comparing version strings.
- **Semantic Versioning Support**: It supports semantic versioning, allowing you to compare versions like `1.0.0`, `1.0.1`, etc.
- **Custom Comparison Logic**: You can define custom comparison logic if needed.

In summary, the `version_comparator` package is an essential tool for any Flutter developer looking to manage versioning effectively in their applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Version Comparator Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `version_comparator` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  version_comparator: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:version_comparator/version_comparator.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

### Basic Usage

You can use the `VersionComparator` class to compare version strings. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
void main() {
  String version1 = "1.0.0";
  String version2 = "1.0.1";

  // Compare versions
  int result = VersionComparator.compare(version1, version2);

  if (result < 0) {
    print("$version1 is less than $version2");
  } else if (result > 0) {
    print("$version1 is greater than $version2");
  } else {
    print("$version1 is equal to $version2");
  }
}
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set appropriately in your `android/app/build.gradle` file. The `version_comparator` package does not require any special permissions or configurations.

#### iOS

For iOS, make sure your deployment target is set to a version that supports the features you are using. You can set this in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Optimizations

While the package is lightweight, you can optimize your app by caching version comparisons if you are performing them frequently. This can be done by storing the results in a local variable or using a state management solution.

By following these steps, you can effectively integrate the `version_comparator` package into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using the Version Comparator Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:version_comparator/version_comparator.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Version Comparator Demo',
      home: VersionComparatorHome(),
    );
  }
}

class VersionComparatorHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _VersionComparatorHomeState createState() => _VersionComparatorHomeState();
}

class _VersionComparatorHomeState extends State<VersionComparatorHome> {
  String _version1 = "1.0.0";
  String _version2 = "1.0.1";
  String _comparisonResult = "";

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _compareVersions();
  }

  void _compareVersions() {
    // Compare the two version strings
    int result = VersionComparator.compare(_version1, _version2);

    // Determine the comparison result
    if (result < 0) {
      _comparisonResult = "$_version1 is less than $_version2";
    } else if (result > 0) {
      _comparisonResult = "$_version1 is greater than $_version2";
    } else {
      _comparisonResult = "$_version1 is equal to $_version2";
    }

    // Update the UI with the comparison result
    setState(() {});
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Version Comparator'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          _comparisonResult,
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget.
// 3. The home widget is VersionComparatorHome, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 4. In the _VersionComparatorHomeState, the two version strings are initialized.
// 5. The _compareVersions method is called in initState to compare the versions when the widget is first created.
// 6. The comparison result is determined using the VersionComparator.compare method.
// 7. The UI is updated with the comparison result using setState.
// 8. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget displaying the comparison result.
