# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Random Password Generator

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the `random_password_generator` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  random_password_generator: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Package
Now that the package is installed, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to generate a random password:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:random_password_generator/random_password_generator.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Random Password Generator')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Create an instance of the RandomPasswordGenerator
              RandomPasswordGenerator passwordGenerator = RandomPasswordGenerator();

              // Generate a random password
              String password = passwordGenerator.randomPassword(
                letters: true,
                numbers: true,
                specialChars: true,
                passwordLength: 12,
              );

              // Display the generated password
              showDialog(
                context: context,
                builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                  title: Text('Generated Password'),
                  content: Text(password),
                  actions: [
                    TextButton(
                      onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                      child: Text('OK'),
                    ),
                  ],
                ),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Generate Password'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app with a button that generates a random password when pressed. The generated password is displayed in a dialog.

# Complete Example of Random Password Generator

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:random_password_generator/random_password_generator.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Random Password Generator')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Create an instance of the RandomPasswordGenerator
              RandomPasswordGenerator passwordGenerator = RandomPasswordGenerator();

              // Generate a random password with specified criteria
              String password = passwordGenerator.randomPassword(
                letters: true, // Include letters in the password
                numbers: true, // Include numbers in the password
                specialChars: true, // Include special characters in the password
                passwordLength: 12, // Set the length of the password
              );

              // Display the generated password in a dialog
              showDialog(
                context: context,
                builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                  title: Text('Generated Password'), // Title of the dialog
                  content: Text(password), // Display the generated password
                  actions: [
                    TextButton(
                      onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(), // Close the dialog
                      child: Text('OK'), // Button to close the dialog
                    ),
                  ],
                ),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Generate Password'), // Button text
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, there's an AppBar and a Center widget containing an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, an instance of RandomPasswordGenerator is created.
// 5. A random password is generated with letters, numbers, and special characters, with a length of 12.
// 6. The generated password is displayed in an AlertDialog.
// 7. The user can close the dialog by pressing the 'OK' button.
```
