# Tutorial: Setting Up Deepgram Speech to Text in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `deepgram_speech_to_text` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the `deepgram_speech_to_text` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  deepgram_speech_to_text: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request microphone access:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for speech recognition.</string>
<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need Bluetooth access for audio input.</string>
```

## Step 3: Initialize the Package
In your Flutter application, you need to initialize the `deepgram_speech_to_text` package. Here’s how to do it:

```dart
import 'package:deepgram_speech_to_text/deepgram_speech_to_text.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: SpeechToTextScreen(),
    );
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Using the Package
You can now use the package to start recognizing speech. Here’s a simple example of how to implement it in your app.

# Complete Example: Speech to Text Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:deepgram_speech_to_text/deepgram_speech_to_text.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Deepgram Speech to Text',
      home: SpeechToTextScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class SpeechToTextScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SpeechToTextScreenState createState() => _SpeechToTextScreenState();
}

class _SpeechToTextScreenState extends State<SpeechToTextScreen> {
  final DeepgramSpeechToText _speechToText = DeepgramSpeechToText();
  String _transcription = "Press the button and start speaking!";
  bool _isListening = false;

  // Function to start listening to speech
  void _startListening() async {
    setState(() {
      _isListening = true;
      _transcription = "Listening...";
    });

    // Start the speech recognition
    await _speechToText.startListening((text) {
      setState(() {
        _transcription = text; // Update transcription with recognized text
      });
    });
  }

  // Function to stop listening to speech
  void _stopListening() async {
    await _speechToText.stopListening();
    setState(() {
      _isListening = false; // Update listening state
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Deepgram Speech to Text'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              _transcription,
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              textAlign: TextAlign.center,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _isListening ? _stopListening : _startListening,
              child: Text(_isListening ? 'Stop Listening' : 'Start Listening'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The SpeechToTextScreen widget is displayed, which contains the UI for speech recognition.
// 3. When the user presses the button, it toggles between starting and stopping the speech recognition.
// 4. The _startListening method is called, which updates the UI to show that the app is listening and starts the speech recognition process.
// 5. The recognized text is updated in the _transcription variable, which is displayed on the screen.
// 6. When the user stops listening, the _stopListening method is called, which stops the speech recognition and updates the UI accordingly.
```
