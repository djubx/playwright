# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Chart Engine Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **chart_engine** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  chart_engine: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:chart_engine/chart_engine.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the **chart_engine** package to create charts. Below is a simple example of how to create a line chart.

```dart
LineChart(
  data: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50],
  labels: ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May'],
  title: 'Monthly Sales',
);
```

This will create a line chart representing sales data over five months.

## Conclusion

With these steps, you should be able to set up and start using the **chart_engine** package in your Flutter applications. The package's flexibility and ease of use make it a great choice for developers looking to add data visualization features.

# Complete Example of Using the Chart Engine Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:chart_engine/chart_engine.dart'; // Importing the chart_engine package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the RealFlutter app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Chart Engine Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Chart Engine Example'), // App bar title
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: LineChart( // Creating a LineChart widget
            data: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], // Data points for the chart
            labels: ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May'], // Labels for the x-axis
            title: 'Monthly Sales', // Title of the chart
            color: Colors.blue, // Color of the line
            animationDuration: Duration(seconds: 1), // Animation duration
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application, which calls runApp() to start the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter class extends StatelessWidget and builds the main UI of the app.
// 3. A MaterialApp widget is created with a title and a home property that defines the main screen.
// 4. The Scaffold widget provides a structure for the app, including an AppBar and a body.
// 5. In the body, a Center widget is used to center the LineChart widget.
// 6. The LineChart widget is configured with data points, labels, a title, color, and animation duration.
// 7. When the app runs, it displays a line chart representing monthly sales data.
