Here's a detailed technical blog on the "confirm_connection_network" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Confirm Connection Network Flutter Package

The **confirm_connection_network** package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that simplifies the process of checking network connectivity. It provides a straightforward API to confirm whether the device is connected to the internet and to monitor changes in connectivity status. This package is particularly useful in applications that require a stable internet connection for features like data fetching, real-time updates, or user interactions that depend on network availability.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the **confirm_connection_network** package in scenarios such as:

- **Data-Driven Applications**: Apps that rely on fetching data from APIs or databases.
- **Real-Time Applications**: Applications that require real-time updates, such as chat apps or live score updates.
- **User Experience**: Enhancing user experience by providing feedback when the network is unavailable or when connectivity changes.

## Features

- **Simple API**: Easy to integrate and use within your Flutter application.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Automatically detects changes in network status.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Customizable Callbacks**: Allows developers to define custom actions when connectivity changes.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Confirm Connection Network

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **confirm_connection_network** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  confirm_connection_network: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/confirm_connection_network).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file. Add the following lines within the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you need to add the following key to your `Info.plist` file to allow network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:confirm_connection_network/confirm_connection_network.dart';
```

2. Initialize the connection checker and set up listeners for connectivity changes:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late ConfirmConnectionNetwork _connectionNetwork;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _connectionNetwork = ConfirmConnectionNetwork();
    _connectionNetwork.onConnectivityChanged.listen((status) {
      // Handle connectivity changes
      if (status == ConnectivityStatus.connected) {
        print("Connected to the internet");
      } else {
        print("No internet connection");
      }
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Network Connection Example")),
      body: Center(child: Text("Check your console for connectivity status")),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a listener that reacts to changes in network connectivity, allowing you to handle the connection status dynamically.

# Complete Example of Confirm Connection Network

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:confirm_connection_network/confirm_connection_network.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late ConfirmConnectionNetwork _connectionNetwork; // Declare the connection network variable
  String _connectionStatus = "Checking connection..."; // Initial connection status message

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _connectionNetwork = ConfirmConnectionNetwork(); // Initialize the connection network
    _connectionNetwork.onConnectivityChanged.listen((status) {
      // Listen for connectivity changes
      if (status == ConnectivityStatus.connected) {
        setState(() {
          _connectionStatus = "Connected to the internet"; // Update status on connection
        });
      } else {
        setState(() {
          _connectionStatus = "No internet connection"; // Update status on disconnection
        });
      }
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Network Connection Example")),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(_connectionStatus), // Display the current connection status
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, initializing the ConfirmConnectionNetwork instance.
// 3. In the initState method, a listener is set up to monitor connectivity changes.
// 4. When the connectivity status changes, the listener updates the _connectionStatus variable.
// 5. The build method displays the current connection status on the screen.
// 6. The user can see real-time updates about their internet connection status.
```
