Here's a detailed technical blog on the "connection_network_type" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Connection Network Type Flutter Package

The `connection_network_type` Flutter package is a powerful tool that allows developers to easily determine the type of network connection their application is using. This package is particularly useful for applications that require different behaviors based on the network type, such as switching between Wi-Fi and mobile data, or handling offline scenarios gracefully.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `connection_network_type` package in scenarios such as:

- **Network-Sensitive Applications**: Apps that need to adjust their functionality based on the type of network connection (e.g., streaming apps that may want to limit data usage on mobile).
- **Offline Capabilities**: Applications that need to provide a seamless experience when the user is offline, allowing them to queue actions or display cached data.
- **User Experience Enhancements**: Providing users with feedback about their connection type can enhance the overall user experience.

## Features

- **Network Type Detection**: Easily detect whether the device is connected via Wi-Fi, mobile data, or not connected at all.
- **Stream Updates**: Listen for changes in network connectivity in real-time.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.

By leveraging this package, developers can create more robust and user-friendly applications that adapt to the user's network conditions.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Connection Network Type Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `connection_network_type` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  connection_network_type: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/connection_network_type).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you need to add the following key to your `Info.plist` file to request permission to access the network state:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to check the network type and listen for changes.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:connection_network_type/connection_network_type.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _connectionType = 'Unknown';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the connection type
    _initConnectionType();
    // Listen for changes in network connectivity
    ConnectionNetworkType().onConnectionChanged.listen((connectionType) {
      setState(() {
        _connectionType = connectionType;
      });
    });
  }

  Future<void> _initConnectionType() async {
    String connectionType = await ConnectionNetworkType().getConnectionType();
    setState(() {
      _connectionType = connectionType;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Connection Network Type Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Current Connection Type: $_connectionType'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize the connection type and listen for changes. The current connection type is displayed in the center of the screen.

# Complete Example of Connection Network Type

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:connection_network_type/connection_network_type.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _connectionType = 'Unknown'; // Variable to hold the current connection type

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _initConnectionType(); // Initialize the connection type on app start
    // Listen for changes in network connectivity
    ConnectionNetworkType().onConnectionChanged.listen((connectionType) {
      setState(() {
        _connectionType = connectionType; // Update the connection type when it changes
      });
    });
  }

  Future<void> _initConnectionType() async {
    // Get the current connection type asynchronously
    String connectionType = await ConnectionNetworkType().getConnectionType();
    setState(() {
      _connectionType = connectionType; // Set the initial connection type
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Connection Network Type Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Current Connection Type: $_connectionType'), // Display the connection type
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    home: RealFlutter(), // Run the RealFlutter widget
  ));
}
```

// The application starts by running the `main` function, which initializes the Flutter app.
// The `RealFlutter` widget is created, which is a stateful widget.
// In the `initState` method, we call `_initConnectionType` to get the current network type.
// We also set up a listener for changes in the network connection type.
// When the connection type changes, the state is updated, and the UI reflects the new connection type.
// The current connection type is displayed in the center of the screen, providing real-time feedback to the user.

```
