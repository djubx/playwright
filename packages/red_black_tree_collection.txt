# Overview of the `red_black_tree_collection` Flutter Package

The `red_black_tree_collection` package is a powerful data structure library for Flutter that implements a Red-Black Tree, a type of self-balancing binary search tree. This package is particularly useful for applications that require efficient data retrieval, insertion, and deletion operations. Red-Black Trees maintain balance, ensuring that the tree remains approximately balanced, which leads to O(log n) time complexity for these operations.

## When to Use This Package
- **Dynamic Data Management**: When your application needs to manage a dynamic set of data that frequently changes, such as a list of items that can be added or removed.
- **Sorted Data Retrieval**: If you need to maintain a sorted collection of items and require fast access to the minimum, maximum, or any specific element.
- **Performance-Critical Applications**: In scenarios where performance is critical, and you need to ensure that operations on your data structure remain efficient.

## Key Features
- **Self-Balancing**: Automatically maintains balance during insertions and deletions.
- **Efficient Operations**: Provides O(log n) time complexity for insertion, deletion, and search operations.
- **Iterable Interface**: Implements the iterable interface, allowing for easy iteration over elements.
- **Custom Comparators**: Supports custom comparison functions for sorting elements.

This package is an excellent choice for developers looking to implement complex data structures in their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `red_black_tree_collection`

## Installation
To use the `red_black_tree_collection` package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  red_black_tree_collection: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
The `red_black_tree_collection` package is designed to work seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms. There are no specific platform configurations required for this package, making it easy to integrate into your Flutter application.

## Basic Usage
To use the `red_black_tree_collection` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:red_black_tree_collection/red_black_tree_collection.dart';
```

You can then create a Red-Black Tree and perform various operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

### Example Usage
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a Red-Black Tree and perform some basic operations:

```dart
void main() {
  // Create a new Red-Black Tree
  final rbTree = RedBlackTree<int>();

  // Insert elements
  rbTree.insert(10);
  rbTree.insert(20);
  rbTree.insert(5);

  // Print the elements in sorted order
  print(rbTree.toList()); // Output: [5, 10, 20]

  // Remove an element
  rbTree.remove(10);
  print(rbTree.toList()); // Output: [5, 20]
}
```

This example demonstrates the basic operations of inserting and removing elements from the Red-Black Tree.

# Complete Example of Using `red_black_tree_collection`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:red_black_tree_collection/red_black_tree_collection.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Red-Black Tree Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Red-Black Tree Demo'),
        ),
        body: RedBlackTreeDemo(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class RedBlackTreeDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RedBlackTreeDemoState createState() => _RedBlackTreeDemoState();
}

class _RedBlackTreeDemoState extends State<RedBlackTreeDemo> {
  // Create a Red-Black Tree to hold integer values
  final RedBlackTree<int> _rbTree = RedBlackTree<int>();
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        // Input field for adding elements to the tree
        Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
          child: TextField(
            controller: _controller,
            decoration: InputDecoration(
              labelText: 'Enter a number',
              suffixIcon: IconButton(
                icon: Icon(Icons.add),
                onPressed: _addElement,
              ),
            ),
            keyboardType: TextInputType.number,
          ),
        ),
        // Display the elements in the tree
        Expanded(
          child: ListView(
            children: _rbTree.toList().map((e) => ListTile(title: Text(e.toString()))).toList(),
          ),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }

  // Method to add an element to the Red-Black Tree
  void _addElement() {
    final int? value = int.tryParse(_controller.text);
    if (value != null) {
      _rbTree.insert(value); // Insert the value into the tree
      _controller.clear(); // Clear the input field
      setState(() {}); // Update the UI
    }
  }
}
```

// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application that utilizes the `red_black_tree_collection` package.
// 
// 1. **Main Function**: The `main` function initializes the app by running the `RealFlutter` widget.
// 
// 2. **RealFlutter Widget**: This is the main widget of the application, which sets up the MaterialApp and the home screen.
// 
// 3. **RedBlackTreeDemo Widget**: This stateful widget manages the Red-Black Tree and the user interface.
// 
// 4. **TextField**: Users can input numbers to be added to the Red-Black Tree. The input is processed when the add button is pressed.
// 
// 5. **ListView**: Displays the current elements in the Red-Black Tree in sorted order.
// 
// 6. **_addElement Method**: This method parses the input from the TextField, inserts it into the Red-Black Tree, clears the input field, and updates the UI to reflect the changes.
// 
// The application allows users to dynamically add numbers to the Red-Black Tree and view the sorted list of numbers in real-time.
