// The app flow is as follows:
// 1. The user starts the app and is presented with a screen containing four buttons.
// 2. The user clicks the "Insert Elements" button, which inserts three elements (5, 2, and 8) into the Red-Black tree.
// 3. The user clicks the "Search Element" button, which searches for the element 2 in the tree and prints the result to the console.
// 4. The user clicks the "Delete Element" button, which deletes the element 2 from the tree.
// 5. The user clicks the "Range Query" button, which performs a range query on the tree to find all elements between 3 and 7 and prints the result to the console.

// The Red-Black tree is self-balancing, so the height of the tree remains relatively small even after many insertions and deletions.
// This makes the tree efficient for searching, inserting, and deleting elements.
