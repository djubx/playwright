# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_custom_carousel_slider

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_custom_carousel_slider` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_custom_carousel_slider: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the carousel slider.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_custom_carousel_slider/flutter_custom_carousel_slider.dart';
```

2. Create a widget that uses the `RealFlutter` class to display the carousel:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Custom Carousel Slider Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: CustomCarouselSlider(
          items: [
            Image.network('https://example.com/image1.jpg'),
            Image.network('https://example.com/image2.jpg'),
            Image.network('https://example.com/image3.jpg'),
          ],
          options: CarouselOptions(
            autoPlay: true,
            height: 200,
            enlargeCenterPage: true,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Finally, run your application to see the carousel in action!

With these steps, you can easily integrate the `flutter_custom_carousel_slider` package into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of flutter_custom_carousel_slider

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_custom_carousel_slider/flutter_custom_carousel_slider.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Custom Carousel Slider',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Custom Carousel Slider Example'), // Title of the app
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: CustomCarouselSlider(
          items: [
            Image.network('https://example.com/image1.jpg'), // First image
            Image.network('https://example.com/image2.jpg'), // Second image
            Image.network('https://example.com/image3.jpg'), // Third image
          ],
          options: CarouselOptions(
            autoPlay: true, // Enables auto-play for the carousel
            height: 200, // Sets the height of the carousel
            enlargeCenterPage: true, // Enlarges the center item
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme, and specifies RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a CustomCarouselSlider is created with a list of image URLs.
// 5. The CarouselOptions are set to enable auto-play, define the height, and enlarge the center page.
// 6. When the app runs, the carousel will automatically transition between the images, providing a smooth user experience.
```
