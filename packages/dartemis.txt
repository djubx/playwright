# Dartemis: A Powerful Entity-Component-System (ECS) for Flutter

Dartemis is a robust Entity-Component-System (ECS) framework designed for Flutter applications. It allows developers to create complex game logic and manage entities in a clean and efficient manner. The ECS architecture separates data (components) from behavior (systems), making it easier to manage and scale applications, especially in game development.

## When to Use Dartemis
- **Game Development**: Ideal for building games where multiple entities interact with each other.
- **Simulation Applications**: Useful for applications that require simulation of complex systems with many interacting components.
- **Performance-Critical Applications**: When you need to optimize performance by decoupling data and behavior.

## Key Features
- **Entity Management**: Easily create, manage, and destroy entities.
- **Component System**: Attach multiple components to entities, allowing for flexible and reusable code.
- **System Processing**: Define systems that operate on entities with specific components, enabling efficient updates and rendering.
- **Event Handling**: Built-in support for event-driven programming, allowing for responsive applications.

Dartemis is a powerful tool for developers looking to implement an ECS architecture in their Flutter projects, providing a structured approach to managing complex interactions and behaviors.

# Setting Up Dartemis in Your Flutter Project

To get started with Dartemis, follow these steps to set up the package in your Flutter project.

## Installation

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add Dartemis as a dependency:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     dartemis: ^0.1.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
- Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS
- No specific configurations are required for iOS, but ensure you have the latest version of Xcode installed.

## Basic Usage

To use Dartemis, you need to create an `Engine`, define your `Components`, and implement `Systems`. Hereâ€™s a simple example to illustrate the setup:

1. **Define Components**: Create classes for your components.

   ```dart
   class Position {
     double x, y;
     Position(this.x, this.y);
   }

   class Velocity {
     double vx, vy;
     Velocity(this.vx, this.vy);
   }
   ```

2. **Create Systems**: Implement systems that will process entities with specific components.

   ```dart
   class MovementSystem extends System {
     @override
     void update(double delta) {
       // Logic to update positions based on velocity
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Initialize the Engine**: Set up the engine and add entities.

   ```dart
   void main() {
     final engine = Engine();
     // Add entities and systems
   }
   ```

This setup provides a foundation for building more complex interactions and behaviors in your Flutter application using Dartemis.

# Complete Example of Dartemis in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dartemis/dartemis.dart';

// Define Position component
class Position {
  double x, y;
  Position(this.x, this.y);
}

// Define Velocity component
class Velocity {
  double vx, vy;
  Velocity(this.vx, this.vy);
}

// Movement system to update positions based on velocity
class MovementSystem extends System {
  @override
  void update(double delta) {
    // Iterate through all entities with Position and Velocity components
    for (var entity in world.getEntitiesWith([Position, Velocity])) {
      final position = entity.getComponent<Position>();
      final velocity = entity.getComponent<Velocity>();
      
      // Update position based on velocity
      position.x += velocity.vx * delta;
      position.y += velocity.vy * delta;
    }
  }
}

// Main application class
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dartemis Example',
      home: GameScreen(),
    );
  }
}

// Game screen where the engine runs
class GameScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _GameScreenState createState() => _GameScreenState();
}

class _GameScreenState extends State<GameScreen> {
  late World world;
  late MovementSystem movementSystem;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the world and systems
    world = World();
    movementSystem = MovementSystem();
    world.addSystem(movementSystem);

    // Create an entity with Position and Velocity components
    final entity = world.createEntity()
      ..addComponent(Position(0, 0))
      ..addComponent(Velocity(100, 50));
    
    // Add the entity to the world
    world.addEntity(entity);
  }

  @override
  void update(double delta) {
    // Update the world and systems
    world.update(delta);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Dartemis Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Running Dartemis ECS!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a GameScreen as its home.
// 3. In the GameScreen's initState, a World is created, and a MovementSystem is initialized and added to the world.
// 4. An entity is created with Position and Velocity components, representing its state in the game.
// 5. The entity is added to the world, allowing it to be processed by the systems.
// 6. The update method is called to update the world and all systems, which in turn updates the position of the entity based on its velocity.
// 7. The application displays a simple message indicating that the Dartemis ECS is running.
