# Language Picker Flutter Package

The **language_picker** Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to simplify the process of selecting languages in Flutter applications. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to choose their preferred language from a list, making it an essential component for internationalization (i18n) in mobile apps.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the **language_picker** package in scenarios such as:
- **Multi-language Applications**: If your app targets a global audience and needs to support multiple languages.
- **User Preferences**: When you want to allow users to select their preferred language for a personalized experience.
- **Dynamic Language Switching**: If your app requires the ability to change languages on-the-fly without restarting the application.

## Features

- **Easy Integration**: Simple to add to your Flutter project with minimal setup.
- **Customizable UI**: Offers options to customize the appearance of the language picker.
- **Support for Multiple Languages**: Comes with a comprehensive list of languages, making it easy to implement.

# Tutorial: Setting Up the Language Picker Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **language_picker** package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **language_picker** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  language_picker: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following line inside the `<application>` tag:

```xml
<application>
    ...
    <meta-data
        android:name="flutterEmbedding"
        android:value="2" />
</application>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` file to support multiple languages. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>CFBundleLocalizations</key>
<array>
    <string>en</string>
    <string>es</string>
    <string>fr</string>
    <!-- Add other languages as needed -->
</array>
```

## Step 3: Using the Language Picker

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is an example of how to implement the language picker in your app.

# Complete Example of Using Language Picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:language_picker/language_picker.dart';
import 'package:language_picker/languages.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Language Picker Example',
      home: LanguagePickerDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class LanguagePickerDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _LanguagePickerDemoState createState() => _LanguagePickerDemoState();
}

class _LanguagePickerDemoState extends State<LanguagePickerDemo> {
  // Variable to hold the selected language
  String _selectedLanguage = 'English';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Language Picker Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display the currently selected language
            Text(
              'Selected Language: $_selectedLanguage',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to open the language picker
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Show the language picker dialog
                showDialog(
                  context: context,
                  builder: (BuildContext context) {
                    return LanguagePickerDialog(
                      title: Text('Select Language'),
                      onValuePicked: (Language language) {
                        // Update the selected language when a language is picked
                        setState(() {
                          _selectedLanguage = language.name;
                        });
                      },
                    );
                  },
                );
              },
              child: Text('Pick a Language'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home widget.
// 3. The LanguagePickerDemo widget is created, which maintains the state of the selected language.
// 4. The UI displays the currently selected language and a button to open the language picker.
// 5. When the button is pressed, a dialog is shown with the language options.
// 6. Upon selecting a language, the state is updated, and the selected language is displayed on the screen.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application that allows users to select their preferred language using the **language_picker** package. The application flow is straightforward: it initializes the app, displays the current language, and opens a dialog for language selection. When a user picks a language, the app updates the displayed language accordingly.

This comprehensive guide should help you integrate the **language_picker** package into your Flutter applications effectively.
