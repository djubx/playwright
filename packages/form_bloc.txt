Here's a detailed technical blog on the "form_bloc" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Description

The `form_bloc` package is a powerful state management solution for Flutter applications that simplifies the process of managing forms. It provides a reactive way to handle form inputs, validation, and submission, making it easier to build complex forms with minimal boilerplate code.

## When to Use `form_bloc`

You should consider using the `form_bloc` package when:
- You have complex forms with multiple fields that require validation.
- You want to manage form state in a reactive way, allowing for real-time updates and validation feedback.
- You need to handle form submissions and manage loading states effectively.

## Features

- **Reactive Form Management**: Automatically updates the UI based on form state changes.
- **Validation**: Built-in support for field validation with customizable validators.
- **Submission Handling**: Easily manage form submissions and loading states.
- **Integration with Bloc**: Leverages the Bloc pattern for state management, making it easy to integrate with other parts of your application.

Overall, `form_bloc` streamlines the process of building forms in Flutter, allowing developers to focus on building features rather than managing state.

# Tutorial

## Setup Process

To get started with the `form_bloc` package, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `form_bloc` dependency.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     form_bloc: ^0.8.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21.
   - **iOS**: Open `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode and ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0.

4. **Import the Package**: In your Dart files, import the `form_bloc` package:

   ```dart
   import 'package:form_bloc/form_bloc.dart';
   ```

## Basic Usage

To use the `form_bloc` package, you need to create a form bloc class that extends `FormBloc`. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
class RealFlutterFormBloc extends FormBloc<String, String> {
  final nameField = TextFieldBloc(validators: [FieldBlocValidators.required]);
  final emailField = TextFieldBloc(validators: [FieldBlocValidators.required, FieldBlocValidators.email]);

  RealFlutterFormBloc() {
    addFieldBlocs(fieldBlocs: [nameField, emailField]);
  }

  @override
  void onSubmitting() {
    // Handle form submission logic here
    emitSuccess();
  }
}
```

In this example:
- We create a `RealFlutterFormBloc` class that manages two fields: `nameField` and `emailField`.
- We add validators to ensure that both fields are required and that the email field contains a valid email address.
- The `onSubmitting` method is overridden to handle the form submission logic.

Now, you can use this form bloc in your Flutter widgets to build a reactive form.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_bloc/flutter_bloc.dart';
import 'package:form_bloc/form_bloc.dart';

// Main entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// MyApp widget that sets up the MaterialApp
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Form Bloc Example',
      home: BlocProvider(
        create: (context) => RealFlutterFormBloc(),
        child: FormScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// FormScreen widget that displays the form
class FormScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final formBloc = context.read<RealFlutterFormBloc>();

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Form Bloc Example')),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextFieldBlocBuilder(
              textFieldBloc: formBloc.nameField,
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Name'),
            ),
            TextFieldBlocBuilder(
              textFieldBloc: formBloc.emailField,
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Email'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: formBloc.submit,
              child: Text('Submit'),
            ),
            BlocListener<RealFlutterFormBloc, FormBlocState>(
              listener: (context, state) {
                if (state.isSuccess) {
                  // Show success message
                  ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                    SnackBar(content: Text('Form submitted successfully!')),
                  );
                }
              },
              child: Container(),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// RealFlutterFormBloc class that manages the form state
class RealFlutterFormBloc extends FormBloc<String, String> {
  final nameField = TextFieldBloc(validators: [FieldBlocValidators.required]);
  final emailField = TextFieldBloc(validators: [FieldBlocValidators.required, FieldBlocValidators.email]);

  RealFlutterFormBloc() {
    // Add the fields to the form bloc
    addFieldBlocs(fieldBlocs: [nameField, emailField]);
  }

  @override
  void onSubmitting() {
    // Handle form submission logic here
    emitSuccess();
  }
}

/*
  Application Flow Explanation:
  1. The application starts with the main() function, which runs the MyApp widget.
  2. MyApp sets up a MaterialApp and provides the RealFlutterFormBloc to the FormScreen.
  3. In FormScreen, we build a form with two text fields for name and email.
  4. When the user presses the submit button, the form bloc's submit method is called.
  5. If the form submission is successful, a success message is displayed using a SnackBar.
  6. The form fields are validated in real-time, providing immediate feedback to the user.
