# Setting Up and Using leancode_forms

## Installation

To get started with `leancode_forms`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  leancode_forms: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/leancode_forms).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage

To use `leancode_forms`, you will typically follow these steps:

1. **Create a Form Model**: Define a model that represents your form fields and their validation rules.
2. **Build the Form**: Use the provided widgets to construct your form UI.
3. **Handle Submission**: Implement logic to handle form submission and validation.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set up a form using `leancode_forms`:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:leancode_forms/leancode_forms.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a form controller
    final formController = FormController();

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Leancode Forms Example')),
      body: Form(
        controller: formController,
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              // Bind the text field to the form controller
              onChanged: (value) => formController.updateField('name', value),
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Name'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Validate and submit the form
                if (formController.validate()) {
                  // Handle successful submission
                  print('Form submitted successfully!');
                } else {
                  // Handle validation errors
                  print('Form validation failed!');
                }
              },
              child: Text('Submit'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates the basic setup and usage of the `leancode_forms` package. You can expand upon this by adding more fields and validation rules as needed.

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a form controller to manage form state
    final formController = FormController();

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Leancode Forms Example')),
      body: Form(
        controller: formController,
        child: Column(
          children: [
            // Text field for name input
            TextField(
              onChanged: (value) => formController.updateField('name', value),
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Name'),
            ),
            // Text field for email input
            TextField(
              onChanged: (value) => formController.updateField('email', value),
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Email'),
            ),
            // Submit button
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Validate the form before submission
                if (formController.validate()) {
                  // If validation passes, print success message
                  print('Form submitted successfully!');
                } else {
                  // If validation fails, print error message
                  print('Form validation failed!');
                }
              },
              child: Text('Submit'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The RealFlutter widget is built, creating a FormController instance to manage the form state.
// 2. The form consists of two text fields for name and email input, each bound to the form controller.
// 3. When the user types in the text fields, the form controller updates the corresponding field values.
// 4. Upon pressing the submit button, the form is validated using the form controller's validate method.
// 5. If validation is successful, a success message is printed; otherwise, an error message is displayed.
