# ZebraUtility Flutter Package

The **ZebraUtility** package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who need to integrate Zebra printers and scanners into their applications. This package simplifies the process of connecting to Zebra devices, allowing developers to focus on building their applications without worrying about the complexities of device communication.

## When to Use ZebraUtility
- **Printing**: If your application requires printing labels or receipts using Zebra printers.
- **Scanning**: When you need to scan barcodes or QR codes using Zebra scanners.
- **Device Management**: For managing Zebra devices within your Flutter application.

## Key Features
- **Easy Integration**: Simplifies the connection process with Zebra printers and scanners.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices.
- **Comprehensive API**: Provides a wide range of functionalities for printing and scanning.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Get immediate responses from devices for better user experience.

With ZebraUtility, developers can enhance their applications with robust printing and scanning capabilities, making it an essential package for businesses that rely on Zebra devices.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using ZebraUtility

## Installation
To add the ZebraUtility package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  zebrautility: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` includes the necessary permissions for Bluetooth and network access:
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

2. If you are using Bluetooth, make sure to request runtime permissions for Android 6.0 (API level 23) and above.

### iOS
1. In your `Info.plist`, add the following keys to request Bluetooth permissions:
   ```xml
   <key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
   <string>This app requires Bluetooth access to connect to Zebra devices.</string>
   ```

2. Ensure that you have the necessary entitlements for Bluetooth communication.

## Basic Usage
To use the ZebraUtility package, you need to initialize the connection to the Zebra device and then use its methods to print or scan.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:zebrautility/zebrautility.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  ZebraUtility zebraUtility = ZebraUtility();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the Zebra utility
    zebraUtility.initialize();
  }

  void printLabel() {
    // Example of printing a label
    zebraUtility.printLabel("Hello, Zebra!");
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Zebra Utility Example")),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: printLabel,
          child: Text("Print Label"),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize the ZebraUtility and create a button to print a label when pressed. The `printLabel` method is called, which sends the print command to the connected Zebra device.

# Complete Example of ZebraUtility

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:zebrautility/zebrautility.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  ZebraUtility zebraUtility = ZebraUtility(); // Create an instance of ZebraUtility

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    zebraUtility.initialize(); // Initialize the Zebra utility on app start
  }

  void printLabel() {
    // This method is called when the button is pressed
    zebraUtility.printLabel("Hello, Zebra!"); // Send print command to the Zebra device
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Zebra Utility Example")), // App bar with title
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: printLabel, // Call printLabel when button is pressed
          child: Text("Print Label"), // Button text
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    home: RealFlutter(), // Run the RealFlutter widget
  ));
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation
// The application starts by running the main function, which initializes the Flutter app.
// The RealFlutter widget is created, and its state is managed by _RealFlutterState.
// In the initState method, we initialize the ZebraUtility to prepare for device communication.
// When the user presses the "Print Label" button, the printLabel method is invoked.
// This method calls the printLabel function from the ZebraUtility instance, sending a print command to the connected Zebra device.
// The app provides a simple interface for printing labels, demonstrating the core functionality of the ZebraUtility package.
