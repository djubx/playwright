# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Dashed Circle

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the dashed_circle package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  dashed_circle: ^1.0.0
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` in your terminal to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Dashed Circle

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a dashed circle:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dashed_circle/dashed_circle.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Dashed Circle Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: DashedCircle(
          dashes: 20, // Number of dashes
          dashLength: 10.0, // Length of each dash
          dashColor: Colors.blue, // Color of the dashes
          strokeWidth: 4.0, // Width of the dashed line
          child: Container(
            width: 100, // Width of the circle
            height: 100, // Height of the circle
            alignment: Alignment.center,
            child: Text(
              'Hello!',
              style: TextStyle(color: Colors.black),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that displays a dashed circle with the text "Hello!" in the center. You can customize the number of dashes, their length, color, and the overall size of the circle.

# Complete Example of Dashed Circle

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dashed_circle/dashed_circle.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dashed Circle Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Dashed Circle Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: DashedCircle(
          dashes: 20, // Number of dashes in the circle
          dashLength: 10.0, // Length of each dash
          dashColor: Colors.blue, // Color of the dashes
          strokeWidth: 4.0, // Width of the dashed line
          child: Container(
            width: 100, // Width of the dashed circle
            height: 100, // Height of the dashed circle
            alignment: Alignment.center,
            child: Text(
              'Hello!',
              style: TextStyle(color: Colors.black), // Text style
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with MyApp as the root widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a DashedCircle is created with specified properties:
//    - dashes: Sets the number of dashes in the circle.
//    - dashLength: Defines the length of each dash.
//    - dashColor: Sets the color of the dashes.
//    - strokeWidth: Specifies the width of the dashed line.
// 5. A Container is placed inside the DashedCircle, which defines its size and centers the text "Hello!".
// 6. The app displays a dashed circle with the text in the center, demonstrating the use of the dashed_circle package.
```
