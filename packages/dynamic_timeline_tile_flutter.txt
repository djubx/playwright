                child: Text('Event 2: Design Phase'),
              ),
            ),
            TimelineTile(
              alignment: TimelineAlign.start,
              isLast: true,
              indicatorStyle: IndicatorStyle(

                iconStyle: IconStyle(
                  iconData: Icons.done,
                  color: Colors.white,

              endChild: Container(
                padding: EdgeInsets.all(16),
                child: Text('Event 3: Project Completion'),
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The above code creates a simple Flutter application that displays a dynamic timeline.
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 2. The TimelineScreen widget builds the UI with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a SingleChildScrollView.
// 3. Inside the SingleChildScrollView, multiple TimelineTile widgets are created to represent different events.
// 4. Each TimelineTile has an indicator style and an end child that displays the event description.
// 5. The timeline is scrollable, allowing users to view all events easily.
