# Complete Example of flutter_neat_and_clean_calendar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_neat_and_clean_calendar/flutter_neat_and_clean_calendar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Neat and Clean Calendar',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: CalendarPage(),
    );
  }
}

class CalendarPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CalendarPageState createState() => _CalendarPageState();
}

class _CalendarPageState extends State<CalendarPage> {
  // This variable will hold the selected date
  DateTime _selectedDate = DateTime.now();
  
  // This list will hold events for the selected date
  List<NeatCleanCalendarEvent> _events = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize some events for demonstration
    _events.add(NeatCleanCalendarEvent(
      title: 'Meeting',
      description: 'Discuss project updates',
      startTime: DateTime.now(),
      endTime: DateTime.now().add(Duration(hours: 1)),
      color: Colors.blue,
    ));
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Calendar Example'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Calendar widget
          NeatCleanCalendar(
            onDateSelected: (date) {
              setState(() {
                _selectedDate = date; // Update the selected date
                // Here you can filter events based on the selected date
              });
            },
            events: _events,
          ),
          // Display selected date
          Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
            child: Text(
              'Selected Date: ${_selectedDate.toLocal()}'.split(' ')[0],
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home page is set to CalendarPage, which is a stateful widget.
// 4. In the _CalendarPageState, we initialize the selected date and a list of events.
// 5. The build method constructs the UI, including the NeatCleanCalendar widget.
// 6. When a date is selected on the calendar, the onDateSelected callback updates the selected date.
// 7. The selected date is displayed below the calendar.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

## Summary of Application Flow
The application begins with the `main` function, which initializes the `RealFlutter` widget. This widget sets up a `MaterialApp` with a title and theme. The home page is defined as `CalendarPage`, a stateful widget that manages the calendar's state.

In the `_CalendarPageState`, we define a variable to hold the currently selected date and a list of events. The `build` method constructs the UI, including the `NeatCleanCalendar` widget. When a user selects a date, the `onDateSelected` callback updates the selected date, and the new date is displayed below the calendar.

This example demonstrates how to integrate the `flutter_neat_and_clean_calendar` package into a Flutter application, showcasing its key features and providing a clear flow of the application.
