```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:music_kit/music_kit.dart'; // Import the music_kit package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the main app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late MusicKit musicKit; // Declare the MusicKit instance
  List<String> playlist = []; // List to hold the playlist
  String currentTrack = ''; // Variable to hold the current track

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    musicKit = MusicKit(); // Initialize the MusicKit instance
    loadPlaylist(); // Load the playlist on startup
  }

  // Function to load the playlist
  void loadPlaylist() {
    playlist = [
      'https://example.com/song1.mp3', // Add your audio file URLs
      'https://example.com/song2.mp3',
    ];
  }

  // Function to play a track
  void playTrack(String track) {
    musicKit.play(track); // Play the selected track
    setState(() {
      currentTrack = track; // Update the current track
    });
  }

  // Function to pause playback
  void pauseTrack() {
    musicKit.pause(); // Pause the current track
  }

  // Function to stop playback
  void stopTrack() {
    musicKit.stop(); // Stop the current track
    setState(() {
      currentTrack = ''; // Clear the current track
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Music Kit Example'), // App title
        ),
        body: Column(
          children: [
            Text('Current Track: $currentTrack'), // Display current track
            Expanded(
              child: ListView.builder(
                itemCount: playlist.length, // Number of tracks in the playlist
                itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                  return ListTile(
                    title: Text('Track ${index + 1}'), // Display track name
                    onTap: () => playTrack(playlist[index]), // Play track on tap
                  );
                },
              ),
            ),
            Row(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceAround,
              children: [
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: pauseTrack, // Pause button
                  child: Text('Pause'),
                ),
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: stopTrack, // Stop button
                  child: Text('Stop'),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget, we initialize the MusicKit instance and load a playlist of audio tracks.
// 3. The UI consists of a list of tracks, where tapping a track will play it using the playTrack function.
// 4. The current track being played is displayed at the top of the screen.
// 5. There are buttons to pause and stop the playback, which call their respective functions.
// 6. The app updates the UI based on the current track and playback state.
```
