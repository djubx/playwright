Here's a detailed technical blog on the "simple_selector" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Simple Selector Flutter Package

The **simple_selector** package is a lightweight and efficient state management solution for Flutter applications. It allows developers to manage state in a simple and intuitive way, making it easier to build responsive UIs. The package is particularly useful for applications that require minimal state management without the overhead of more complex solutions like Provider or Bloc.

## When to Use Simple Selector

- **Small to Medium Applications**: Ideal for applications where state management needs are not overly complex.
- **Performance-Critical Apps**: Since it minimizes rebuilds, it can be beneficial in performance-sensitive applications.
- **Learning and Prototyping**: Great for beginners to understand state management concepts without getting overwhelmed.

## Features

- **Lightweight**: Minimalistic design with no unnecessary dependencies.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple API that integrates seamlessly with Flutter's widget tree.
- **Efficient**: Reduces the number of widget rebuilds, improving performance.
- **Flexible**: Can be used alongside other state management solutions if needed.

# Tutorial: Setting Up Simple Selector

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the **simple_selector** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  simple_selector: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Basic Setup

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, ensure that your `ios/Podfile` has the platform set to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using Simple Selector

To use the **simple_selector** package, you need to create a model class that extends `SelectorModel`. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simple_selector/simple_selector.dart';

class MyModel extends SelectorModel {
  int counter = 0;

  void increment() {
    counter++;
    notifyListeners(); // Notify listeners to rebuild
  }
}
```

Now, you can use the `SimpleSelector` widget to listen to changes in your model:

```dart
class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return SimpleSelector<MyModel>(
      builder: (context, model) {
        return Scaffold(
          appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Simple Selector Example')),
          body: Center(
            child: Column(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              children: <Widget>[
                Text('Counter: ${model.counter}'),
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: model.increment,
                  child: Text('Increment'),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Running the Application

Now you can run your application using:

```bash
flutter run
```

This will launch your app, and you should see a simple counter that increments when you press the button.

# Complete Example of Simple Selector

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simple_selector/simple_selector.dart';

// Main entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// MyApp class that sets up the MaterialApp
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Simple Selector Demo',
      home: SimpleSelector<MyModel>(
        // Providing the model to the SimpleSelector
        model: MyModel(),
        builder: (context, model) {
          return MyHomePage(); // Building the home page
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// MyModel class that extends SelectorModel
class MyModel extends SelectorModel {
  int counter = 0; // State variable to hold the counter value

  // Method to increment the counter
  void increment() {
    counter++; // Increment the counter
    notifyListeners(); // Notify listeners to rebuild the UI
  }
}

// MyHomePage class that builds the main UI
class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Simple Selector Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: SimpleSelector<MyModel>(
          builder: (context, model) {
            return Column(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              children: <Widget>[
                Text('Counter: ${model.counter}'), // Displaying the counter
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: model.increment, // Increment button
                  child: Text('Increment'),
                ),
              ],
            );
          },
        );
      }),
    );
  }
}

// Application flow explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp sets up a MaterialApp and provides an instance of MyModel to SimpleSelector.
// 3. MyModel holds the state (counter) and provides a method to increment it.
// 4. MyHomePage builds the UI, displaying the current counter value and a button to increment it.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the increment method is called, updating the counter and notifying listeners to rebuild the UI.
```
