# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Circle Chart

## Installation
To use the `circle_chart` package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  circle_chart: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package. After saving the file, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
Once the package is installed, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a basic circle chart.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:circle_chart/circle_chart.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Circle Chart Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: CircleChart(
            data: [30, 20, 50],
            colors: [Colors.red, Colors.green, Colors.blue],
            animationDuration: Duration(seconds: 1),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple circle chart with three segments representing 30%, 20%, and 50% of the total. The colors for each segment are specified, and an animation duration is set for the chart rendering.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the `circle_chart` package in your Flutter applications effectively.

# Complete Example of Circle Chart

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:circle_chart/circle_chart.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Circle Chart Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Centering the CircleChart widget
          child: CircleChart(
            // Data for the chart segments
            data: [30, 20, 50],
            // Colors for each segment
            colors: [Colors.red, Colors.green, Colors.blue],
            // Duration for the animation
            animationDuration: Duration(seconds: 1),
            // Optional: Adding a title to the chart
            title: 'Data Distribution',
            // Optional: Adding a legend
            legend: true,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The above code creates a Flutter application that displays a circular chart.
// 1. The `RealFlutter` class extends `StatelessWidget`, which means it doesn't maintain any state.
// 2. The `build` method returns a `MaterialApp` widget, which is the root of the application.
// 3. Inside the `MaterialApp`, a `Scaffold` widget is used to provide a structure for the app, including an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The `CircleChart` widget is placed in the center of the screen, displaying three segments with specified data and colors.
// 5. The chart animates over one second when rendered, providing a smooth visual experience.
// 6. Optional features like a title and legend can be added to enhance the chart's usability and information delivery.
