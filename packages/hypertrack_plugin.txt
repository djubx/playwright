# Hypertrack Plugin: A Comprehensive Overview

The `hypertrack_plugin` is a Flutter package that provides seamless integration with Hypertrack's location tracking services. This package is particularly useful for applications that require real-time location tracking, such as delivery services, ride-sharing apps, or any application that needs to monitor user movements.

## When to Use This Package
- **Delivery Applications**: Track the location of delivery personnel in real-time.
- **Ride-Sharing Services**: Monitor the movement of drivers and passengers.
- **Field Service Management**: Keep track of field agents or technicians as they move between locations.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Location Tracking**: Get continuous updates on the user's location.
- **Geofencing**: Set up virtual boundaries and receive notifications when users enter or exit these areas.
- **User Management**: Manage user profiles and their associated tracking data.
- **Event Tracking**: Log specific events related to user movements.

The `hypertrack_plugin` is a powerful tool for developers looking to implement location-based features in their Flutter applications, providing a robust set of functionalities to enhance user experience.

# Setting Up the Hypertrack Plugin

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `hypertrack_plugin` and how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Installation

To add the `hypertrack_plugin` to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  hypertrack_plugin: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/hypertrack_plugin).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Add the necessary permissions for location tracking.
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/>
   ```

2. **Enable Background Location**: If your app needs to track location in the background, ensure you have the appropriate settings in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:
   ```xml
   <application>
       <meta-data
           android:name="com.hypertrack.sdk.api_key"
           android:value="YOUR_HYPERTRACK_API_KEY"/>
   </application>
   ```

### iOS Configuration
1. **Update Info.plist**: Add the following keys to request location permissions:
   ```xml
   <key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need your location to provide better services.</string>
   <key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need your location to provide better services even when the app is in the background.</string>
   ```

2. **Enable Background Modes**: In your Xcode project, enable "Location updates" under Background Modes.

## Basic Usage

After setting up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Here’s a simple example of how to initialize the Hypertrack SDK and start tracking the user's location.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:hypertrack_plugin/hypertrack_plugin.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize Hypertrack with your API key
    HypertrackPlugin.initialize("YOUR_HYPERTRACK_API_KEY");
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Hypertrack Example")),
      body: Center(child: Text("Tracking User Location")),
    );
  }
}
```

This code initializes the Hypertrack SDK and sets up a basic Flutter application that displays a message indicating that user location tracking is active.

# Complete Example of Hypertrack Plugin

Here’s a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the `hypertrack_plugin`.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:hypertrack_plugin/hypertrack_plugin.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to hold the tracking status
  bool isTracking = false;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize Hypertrack with your API key
    HypertrackPlugin.initialize("YOUR_HYPERTRACK_API_KEY");
  }

  // Function to start tracking
  void startTracking() {
    HypertrackPlugin.startTracking();
    setState(() {
      isTracking = true; // Update tracking status
    });
  }

  // Function to stop tracking
  void stopTracking() {
    HypertrackPlugin.stopTracking();
    setState(() {
      isTracking = false; // Update tracking status
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Hypertrack Example")),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text(isTracking ? "Tracking User Location" : "Not Tracking"),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: isTracking ? stopTracking : startTracking,
              child: Text(isTracking ? "Stop Tracking" : "Start Tracking"),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app initializes the Hypertrack SDK with the provided API key in initState().
// 2. The user can start or stop tracking by pressing the button.
// 3. When tracking starts, the app updates the UI to reflect the tracking status.
// 4. The startTracking() and stopTracking() methods control the tracking state using Hypertrack's methods.
// 5. The UI updates dynamically based on the tracking status, providing feedback to the user.
```
