# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Primer Progress Bar

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **primer_progress_bar** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  primer_progress_bar: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Primer Progress Bar

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a linear progress bar.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:primer_progress_bar/primer_progress_bar.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Primer Progress Bar Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              Text('Loading...'),
              PrimerProgressBar(
                value: 0.5, // Set the progress value (0.0 to 1.0)
                backgroundColor: Colors.grey[300],
                color: Colors.blue,
                height: 10.0,
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that displays a linear progress bar indicating 50% progress. You can customize the `value`, `backgroundColor`, `color`, and `height` properties to fit your design needs.

# Complete Example of Primer Progress Bar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:primer_progress_bar/primer_progress_bar.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  double _progress = 0.0; // Initialize progress value

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _simulateLoading(); // Start simulating loading
  }

  // Simulate a loading process
  void _simulateLoading() async {
    for (int i = 0; i <= 100; i++) {
      await Future.delayed(Duration(milliseconds: 50)); // Simulate work
      setState(() {
        _progress = i / 100; // Update progress value
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Primer Progress Bar Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              Text('Loading... ${(_progress * 100).toStringAsFixed(0)}%'), // Display percentage
              PrimerProgressBar(
                value: _progress, // Set the progress value
                backgroundColor: Colors.grey[300], // Background color
                color: Colors.blue, // Progress color
                height: 10.0, // Height of the progress bar
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatefulWidget that maintains the progress state.
// 3. In the initState method, we call _simulateLoading to start the loading simulation.
// 4. The _simulateLoading method updates the progress value from 0 to 100 over time.
// 5. The build method displays the current loading percentage and the progress bar.
// 6. The PrimerProgressBar widget reflects the current progress visually, updating as the value changes.
```
