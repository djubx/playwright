# Setting Up and Using the `left_scroll_actions` Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up and using the `left_scroll_actions` package in a Flutter project. We will cover platform-specific configurations for both Android and iOS.

## Setup Process

1. **Add Dependency**

   Add the `left_scroll_actions` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     left_scroll_actions: ^1.0.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**

   Run the following command to install the new package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configurations**

   - **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

     ```gradle
     defaultConfig {
         minSdkVersion 21
     }
     ```

   - **iOS**: No additional configuration is required for iOS.

## Using the Package

To use the `left_scroll_actions` package, import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:left_scroll_actions/left_scroll_actions.dart';
```

### Basic Usage

Wrap your list items with the `LeftScroll` widget and define the actions you want to provide:

```dart
LeftScroll(
  child: ListTile(
    title: Text('Swipe me!'),
  ),
  buttons: <Widget>[
    LeftScrollItem(
      text: 'Delete',
      color: Colors.red,
      onTap: () {
        // Handle delete action
      },
    ),
    LeftScrollItem(
      text: 'Archive',
      color: Colors.blue,
      onTap: () {
        // Handle archive action
      },
    ),
  ],
)
```

This setup provides a basic swipe action functionality, allowing users to swipe left on a list item to reveal the defined actions.

# Complete Example of Using `left_scroll_actions` in Flutter

Below is a complete Flutter application demonstrating the use of the `left_scroll_actions` package. This example includes detailed comments explaining each part of the code.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:left_scroll_actions/left_scroll_actions.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Left Scroll Actions Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  final List<String> items = List<String>.generate(20, (i) => "Item $i");

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Left Scroll Actions'),
      ),
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: items.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return LeftScroll(
            // The main content of the list item
            child: ListTile(
              title: Text(items[index]),
            ),
            // Define the actions that appear when swiping left
            buttons: <Widget>[
              LeftScrollItem(
                text: 'Delete',
                color: Colors.red,
                onTap: () {
                  // Handle delete action
                  ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                    SnackBar(content: Text('Deleted ${items[index]}')),
                  );
                },
              ),
              LeftScrollItem(
                text: 'Archive',
                color: Colors.blue,
                onTap: () {
                  // Handle archive action
                  ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                    SnackBar(content: Text('Archived ${items[index]}')),
                  );
                },
              ),
            ],
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The application starts with the `main` function, which calls `runApp` with `MyApp`.
// `MyApp` is a stateless widget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// The `HomePage` widget is the main screen, displaying a list of items.
// Each item in the list is wrapped in a `LeftScroll` widget to enable swipe actions.
// The `LeftScroll` widget contains a `ListTile` as its child, displaying the item text.
// Two actions are defined: 'Delete' and 'Archive', each with its own color and tap handler.
// When an action is tapped, a SnackBar is shown to confirm the action.
