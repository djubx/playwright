# Overview of the ascii_art_tree Flutter Package

The `ascii_art_tree` package is a unique Flutter package designed to generate ASCII art representations of tree structures. This package is particularly useful for developers who want to visualize hierarchical data in a simple and text-based format. It can be used in various applications, such as command-line tools, educational apps, or even as a debugging aid to represent data structures.

## When to Use This Package
- **Data Visualization**: When you need to represent hierarchical data in a compact and readable format.
- **Debugging**: To visualize complex data structures during development.
- **Educational Tools**: For teaching concepts related to trees and data structures.

## Features
- **Tree Representation**: Easily create ASCII art trees from data structures.
- **Customizable**: Options to customize the appearance of the tree.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies, making it easy to integrate into any Flutter project.

Overall, the `ascii_art_tree` package is a handy tool for developers looking to add a unique touch to their applications by visualizing data in an ASCII format.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the ascii_art_tree Package

## Installation
To use the `ascii_art_tree` package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  ascii_art_tree: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
The `ascii_art_tree` package is designed to work seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms. There are no specific configurations required for either platform, making it easy to integrate into your Flutter application.

## Basic Usage
To use the package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:ascii_art_tree/ascii_art_tree.dart';
```

You can then create a tree structure and generate its ASCII representation. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
void main() {
  // Create a sample tree structure
  final tree = AsciiArtTree(
    root: 'Root',
    children: [
      AsciiArtTreeNode('Child 1', [
        AsciiArtTreeNode('Grandchild 1'),
        AsciiArtTreeNode('Grandchild 2'),
      ]),
      AsciiArtTreeNode('Child 2'),
    ],
  );

  // Print the ASCII representation of the tree
  print(tree.toAscii());
}
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to create a tree with a root node and two child nodes, each with their own children. The `toAscii()` method generates the ASCII art representation of the tree.

With this setup, you can easily visualize tree structures in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Using the ascii_art_tree Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ascii_art_tree/ascii_art_tree.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'ASCII Art Tree Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('ASCII Art Tree Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
            child: Column(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              children: [
                Text(
                  'ASCII Art Tree:',
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
                ),
                SizedBox(height: 20),
                // Create a sample tree structure
                Text(
                  _generateAsciiTree(),
                  style: TextStyle(fontFamily: 'Courier', fontSize: 16),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to generate the ASCII representation of the tree
  String _generateAsciiTree() {
    // Create the tree structure
    final tree = AsciiArtTree(
      root: 'Root',
      children: [
        AsciiArtTreeNode('Child 1', [
          AsciiArtTreeNode('Grandchild 1'),
          AsciiArtTreeNode('Grandchild 2'),
        ]),
        AsciiArtTreeNode('Child 2'),
      ],
    );

    // Return the ASCII representation
    return tree.toAscii();
  }
}
```

```dart
// Explanation of the application flow:

// 1. The main function starts the Flutter application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatelessWidget that builds the main UI of the app.
// 3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a title and a Scaffold.
// 4. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "ASCII Art Tree Example".
// 5. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Column widget.
// 6. The Column has a Text widget displaying "ASCII Art Tree:" and a SizedBox for spacing.
// 7. The _generateAsciiTree() function is called to create the ASCII representation of the tree.
// 8. The generated ASCII art is displayed in a Text widget with a monospace font for better readability.
// 9. The _generateAsciiTree() function constructs the tree structure using AsciiArtTree and AsciiArtTreeNode classes.
// 10. Finally, the ASCII representation is returned and displayed in the app.
