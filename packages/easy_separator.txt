# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Easy Separator

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **easy_separator** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  easy_separator: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the separator, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:easy_separator/easy_separator.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Separator

You can now use the `EasySeparator` widget in your Flutter application. Below are platform-specific details for Android and iOS:

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, make sure to enable the necessary permissions in your `Info.plist` if your app requires any specific configurations.

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the `EasySeparator` widget in your Flutter app:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:easy_separator/easy_separator.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Easy Separator Example')),
        body: Column(
          children: [
            Text('Section 1'),
            EasySeparator(
              color: Colors.blue,
              thickness: 2.0,
              length: 100.0,
            ),
            Text('Section 2'),
            EasySeparator(
              color: Colors.red,
              thickness: 1.0,
              length: 150.0,
              isDashed: true,
            ),
            Text('Section 3'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple app with three sections separated by the `EasySeparator` widget. The first separator is solid blue, while the second is a dashed red line.

# Complete Example of Easy Separator

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart'; // Importing Flutter material package
import 'package:easy_separator/easy_separator.dart'; // Importing the easy_separator package

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp()); // Running the MyApp widget
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Easy Separator Example')), // App bar with title
        body: Column(
          children: [
            Text('Section 1'), // First section text
            EasySeparator(
              color: Colors.blue, // Setting color of the separator
              thickness: 2.0, // Setting thickness of the separator
              length: 100.0, // Setting length of the separator
            ),
            Text('Section 2'), // Second section text
            EasySeparator(
              color: Colors.red, // Setting color of the second separator
              thickness: 1.0, // Setting thickness of the second separator
              length: 150.0, // Setting length of the second separator
              isDashed: true, // Making the second separator dashed
            ),
            Text('Section 3'), // Third section text
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body is a Column widget that arranges its children vertically.
// 5. Each section of text is separated by an EasySeparator widget.
// 6. The first separator is a solid blue line, while the second is a dashed red line.
// 7. This structure allows for clear visual separation between different sections of the app.
