# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Processing Camera Image Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `processing_camera_image` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `processing_camera_image` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  processing_camera_image: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version
    }
}
```

2. Add camera permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request camera access:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to capture images.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save images.</string>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple Flutter application that captures an image and processes it.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:processing_camera_image/processing_camera_image.dart';
```

2. Create a simple UI with a button to capture an image and display it.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:processing_camera_image/processing_camera_image.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Camera Processing Example',
      home: CameraScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class CameraScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CameraScreenState createState() => _CameraScreenState();
}

class _CameraScreenState extends State<CameraScreen> {
  // Variable to hold the captured image
  Image? _capturedImage;

  // Function to capture an image
  Future<void> _captureImage() async {
    // Use the processing_camera_image package to capture an image
    final image = await ProcessingCameraImage.captureImage();

    // Check if an image was captured
    if (image != null) {
      setState(() {
        // Update the state with the captured image
        _capturedImage = Image.file(image);
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Camera Processing Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the captured image if available
            _capturedImage ?? Text('No image captured yet.'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _captureImage, // Capture image on button press
              child: Text('Capture Image'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (CameraScreen).
// 3. CameraScreen is a stateful widget that manages the state of the captured image.
// 4. The _captureImage function uses the processing_camera_image package to capture an image.
// 5. If an image is captured, it updates the state to display the image.
// 6. The UI consists of a button to capture the image and a placeholder for the captured image.
```
