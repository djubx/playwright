<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cloudimage_360_view/cloudimage_360_view.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: '360 View Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('360 Image Viewer'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          // The CloudImage360View widget is used to display the 360-degree image.
          child: CloudImage360View(
            // URL of the 360-degree image.
            imageUrl: 'https://example.com/path/to/your/360image.jpg',
            // Optional: Set the height and width of the viewer.
            height: 400,
            width: 400,
            // Optional: Set the background color of the viewer.
            backgroundColor: Colors.black,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the Flutter application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title '360 Image Viewer'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains the CloudImage360View widget.
// 5. The CloudImage360View widget takes an image URL and optional parameters for height, width, and background color.
// 6. When the app runs, it displays a 360-degree image that users can interact with by dragging their finger across the screen.
