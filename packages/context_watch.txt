# Context Watch Flutter Package
================================

The `context_watch` Flutter package provides a simple and efficient way to observe and react to changes in the app's context. It allows you to watch for changes in the app's lifecycle, such as when the app is paused or resumed, and perform actions accordingly.

### When to Use

This package is useful when you need to perform actions in response to changes in the app's lifecycle, such as:

* Saving data when the app is paused or closed
* Updating the UI when the app is resumed
* Handling network requests or other asynchronous operations

### Features

* Observe changes in the app's lifecycle
* Perform actions in response to lifecycle events
* Support for both Android and iOS platforms

# Setup and Usage
================

To use the `context_watch` package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Pubspec

Add the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  context_watch: ^1.0.0
```
Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:context_watch/context_watch.dart';
```
### Step 3: Create a Context Watcher

Create a context watcher instance:
```dart
final contextWatcher = ContextWatcher();
```
### Step 4: Observe Lifecycle Events

Use the `observe` method to watch for lifecycle events:
```dart
contextWatcher.observe((event) {
  if (event == LifecycleEvent.paused) {
    // Perform actions when the app is paused
  } else if (event == LifecycleEvent.resumed) {
    // Perform actions when the app is resumed
  }
});
```
### Platform-Specific Details

* On Android, the `context_watch` package uses the `android.app.ActivityLifecycleCallbacks` API to observe lifecycle events.
* On iOS, the package uses the `UIApplicationDelegate` API to observe lifecycle events.

### Required Configurations or Optimizations

No additional configurations or optimizations are required.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:context_watch/context_watch.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Context Watch Example',
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  final contextWatcher = ContextWatcher();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    contextWatcher.observe((event) {
      if (event == LifecycleEvent.paused) {
        // Perform actions when the app is paused
        print('App paused');
      } else if (event == LifecycleEvent.resumed) {
        // Perform actions when the app is resumed
        print('App resumed');
      }
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Context Watch Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Observe lifecycle events'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application flow:
// 1. The app starts and the `MyApp` widget is built.
// 2. The `MyHomePage` widget is created and the `contextWatcher` instance is initialized.
// 3. The `observe` method is called to watch for lifecycle events.
// 4. When the app is paused or resumed, the corresponding lifecycle event is triggered.
// 5. The actions associated with the lifecycle event are performed.
// 6. The app continues to run and observe lifecycle events.

// Final summary:
// The `context_watch` package provides a simple and efficient way to observe and react to changes in the app's lifecycle.
// By using the `observe` method, you can perform actions in response to lifecycle events, such as saving data or updating the UI.
// The package supports both Android and iOS platforms and requires no additional configurations or optimizations.
