# Dynamic Height Grid View Flutter Package

The `dynamic_height_grid_view` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to create grid views with dynamic item heights. This package is particularly useful when you need to display a collection of items that vary in size, such as images with different aspect ratios or text blocks of varying lengths. By using this package, developers can ensure that their grid layouts are both aesthetically pleasing and functionally efficient.

## When to Use

- **Image Galleries**: When displaying a collection of images with different dimensions.
- **Product Listings**: For e-commerce apps where product descriptions or images vary in size.
- **Social Media Feeds**: To handle posts with varying content lengths and media types.

## Features

- **Dynamic Sizing**: Automatically adjusts the height of grid items based on their content.
- **Customizable Layouts**: Offers flexibility in defining the number of columns and spacing.
- **Efficient Rendering**: Optimized for performance, ensuring smooth scrolling even with large datasets.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Dynamic Height Grid View

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up and using the `dynamic_height_grid_view` package in a Flutter project. We will cover platform-specific configurations for both Android and iOS to ensure optimal performance.

## Setup Process

1. **Add Dependency**

   First, add the `dynamic_height_grid_view` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     dynamic_height_grid_view: ^1.0.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**

   Run the following command to install the new package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configurations**

   - **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

     ```gradle
     defaultConfig {
         minSdkVersion 21
     }
     ```

   - **iOS**: No specific configurations are required, but ensure your deployment target is set to iOS 9.0 or higher in your `ios/Podfile`:

     ```ruby
     platform :ios, '9.0'
     ```

## Using the Package

To use the `dynamic_height_grid_view`, import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:dynamic_height_grid_view/dynamic_height_grid_view.dart';
```

You can then use the `DynamicHeightGridView` widget to create a grid with dynamic item heights. Customize the number of columns and spacing as needed.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dynamic_height_grid_view/dynamic_height_grid_view.dart';

void main() => runApp(RealFlutterApp());

class RealFlutterApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dynamic Height Grid View Demo',
      home: GridDemoScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class GridDemoScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final List<String> items = List.generate(20, (index) => 'Item $index');

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Dynamic Height Grid View'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
        child: DynamicHeightGridView(
          itemCount: items.length,
          crossAxisCount: 2, // Number of columns
          builder: (context, index) {
            return Card(
              child: Center(
                child: Padding(
                  padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
                  child: Text(
                    items[index],
                    style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18),
                  ),
                ),
              ),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with RealFlutterApp.
// RealFlutterApp is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home screen.
// GridDemoScreen is the home screen, displaying a grid of items using DynamicHeightGridView.
// The grid is configured with two columns and dynamically adjusts the height of each item.
// Each grid item is a Card widget containing centered text, demonstrating dynamic sizing.
