# Setting Up and Using `colorfilter_generator`

In this section, we'll walk through the setup process for the `colorfilter_generator` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter project.

## Setup

1. **Add Dependency**

   Add the `colorfilter_generator` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     colorfilter_generator: ^1.0.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**

   Run the following command to install the new package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

No additional configuration is required for Android. Ensure your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
minSdkVersion 21
```

### iOS

Ensure your iOS deployment target is set to at least 9.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

## Using the Package

To use the `colorfilter_generator`, import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:colorfilter_generator/colorfilter_generator.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('ColorFilter Generator Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ColorFiltered(
            // Apply a sepia filter to the image
            colorFilter: ColorFilterGenerator.sepia(),
            child: Image.network(
              'https://example.com/sample-image.jpg',
              width: 300,
              height: 300,
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// Inside the Center widget, a ColorFiltered widget is used to apply a sepia filter.
// The ColorFiltered widget wraps an Image widget, which loads an image from the network.
// The ColorFilterGenerator.sepia() method is used to create a sepia color filter.
// This filter is applied to the image, altering its appearance to have a sepia tone.
