# Setting Up and Using the AdMob Flutter Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `admob_flutter` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `admob_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  admob_flutter: ^0.13.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Configure Android

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions and metadata:

```xml
<manifest>
    <application>
        <!-- Add this inside the <application> tag -->
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.google.android.gms.ads.APPLICATION_ID"
            android:value="YOUR_ADMOB_APP_ID"/> <!-- Replace with your AdMob App ID -->
    </application>
</manifest>
```

2. **Enable ProGuard** (optional): If you are using ProGuard, ensure that you add the following rules to your `proguard-rules.pro` file:

```pro
-keep class com.google.android.gms.ads.** { *; }
-keep class com.google.ads.mediation.** { *; }
```

## Step 3: Configure iOS

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>GADApplicationIdentifier</key>
<string>YOUR_ADMOB_APP_ID</string> <!-- Replace with your AdMob App ID -->
```

2. **Enable App Transport Security**: Ensure that your app can access the AdMob servers by adding the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Initialize AdMob

In your main Dart file, initialize AdMob before running your app:

```dart
import 'package:admob_flutter/admob_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  Admob.initialize();
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 5: Using AdMob Ads

You can now use various ad formats in your app. Here’s a brief overview of how to implement banner ads, interstitial ads, and rewarded ads.

### Banner Ad Example

```dart
AdmobBanner(
  adUnitId: 'YOUR_BANNER_AD_UNIT_ID', // Replace with your Banner Ad Unit ID
  adListener: (AdmobAdEvent event) {
    print("Banner Ad event: $event");
  },
)
```

### Interstitial Ad Example

```dart
AdmobInterstitial interstitialAd = AdmobInterstitial(
  adUnitId: 'YOUR_INTERSTITIAL_AD_UNIT_ID', // Replace with your Interstitial Ad Unit ID
  listener: (AdmobAdEvent event) {
    print("Interstitial Ad event: $event");
  },
);

// Load and show the ad
interstitialAd.load();
interstitialAd.show();
```

### Rewarded Ad Example

```dart
AdmobReward rewardAd = AdmobReward(
  adUnitId: 'YOUR_REWARDED_AD_UNIT_ID', // Replace with your Rewarded Ad Unit ID
  listener: (AdmobAdEvent event) {
    print("Rewarded Ad event: $event");
  },
);

// Load and show the ad
rewardAd.load();
rewardAd.show();
```

With these steps, you can successfully integrate and use the `admob_flutter` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using AdMob Flutter Package

Here’s a complete example of a Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the `admob_flutter` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:admob_flutter/admob_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize AdMob with your app ID
  Admob.initialize();
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'AdMob Flutter Example',
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  // Create an instance of the interstitial ad
  AdmobInterstitial interstitialAd;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the interstitial ad
    interstitialAd = AdmobInterstitial(
      adUnitId: 'YOUR_INTERSTITIAL_AD_UNIT_ID', // Replace with your Interstitial Ad Unit ID
      listener: (AdmobAdEvent event) {
        print("Interstitial Ad event: $event");
        // Load a new ad when the current one is closed
        if (event == AdmobAdEvent.closed) {
          interstitialAd.load();
        }
      },
    );
    // Load the interstitial ad
    interstitialAd.load();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the interstitial ad when the widget is disposed
    interstitialAd.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('AdMob Flutter Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display a banner ad
            AdmobBanner(
              adUnitId: 'YOUR_BANNER_AD_UNIT_ID', // Replace with your Banner Ad Unit ID
              adListener: (AdmobAdEvent event) {
                print("Banner Ad event: $event");
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Show the interstitial ad when the button is pressed
                interstitialAd.show();
              },
              child: Text('Show Interstitial Ad'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts by initializing AdMob with the app ID.
// 2. The main widget, RealFlutter, sets up the MaterialApp and home page.
// 3. MyHomePage is a stateful widget that manages the interstitial ad.
// 4. In initState, the interstitial ad is created and loaded.
// 5. The banner ad is displayed at the center of the screen.
// 6. When the button is pressed, the interstitial ad is shown.
// 7. The interstitial ad listener handles events, such as loading a new ad when the current one is closed.
// 8. The interstitial ad is disposed of when the widget is removed from the widget tree.
```
