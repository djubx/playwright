# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Month Picker Dialog

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the `month_picker_dialog` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  month_picker_dialog: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Importing the Package
In your Dart file where you want to use the month picker dialog, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:month_picker_dialog/month_picker_dialog.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Month Picker Dialog
You can now use the month picker dialog in your application. Below is an example of how to implement it in a Flutter widget.

### Platform-Specific Details
- **Android**: Ensure that your app's theme is set to a Material theme to maintain consistency with the dialog's design.
- **iOS**: The dialog will automatically adapt to the iOS design guidelines, providing a native look and feel.

## Example Usage
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to trigger the month picker dialog when a button is pressed:

```dart
void _selectMonth(BuildContext context) async {
  DateTime? selectedMonth = await showMonthPicker(
    context: context,
    initialDate: DateTime.now(),
    firstDate: DateTime(2020),
    lastDate: DateTime(2030),
  );

  if (selectedMonth != null) {
    // Handle the selected month
    print("Selected month: ${selectedMonth.month}/${selectedMonth.year}");
  }
}
```

In this example, the `_selectMonth` function opens the month picker dialog, allowing the user to select a month and year. The selected date is then printed to the console.

With these steps, you can easily integrate the `month_picker_dialog` package into your Flutter application and provide a seamless month selection experience for your users.

# Complete Example of Month Picker Dialog

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:month_picker_dialog/month_picker_dialog.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Month Picker Dialog Example',
      home: MonthPickerHome(),
    );
  }
}

class MonthPickerHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MonthPickerHomeState createState() => _MonthPickerHomeState();
}

class _MonthPickerHomeState extends State<MonthPickerHome> {
  DateTime? _selectedMonth; // Variable to hold the selected month

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Month Picker Dialog Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text(
              _selectedMonth == null
                  ? 'No month selected'
                  : 'Selected month: ${_selectedMonth!.month}/${_selectedMonth!.year}',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () => _selectMonth(context), // Trigger month picker
              child: Text('Select Month'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to show the month picker dialog
  void _selectMonth(BuildContext context) async {
    DateTime? selectedMonth = await showMonthPicker(
      context: context,
      initialDate: DateTime.now(), // Set the initial date to now
      firstDate: DateTime(2020), // Set the first selectable date
      lastDate: DateTime(2030), // Set the last selectable date
    );

    if (selectedMonth != null) {
      setState(() {
        _selectedMonth = selectedMonth; // Update the selected month
      });
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget.
// 3. MonthPickerHome is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the selected month.
// 4. In the build method, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget containing a Text and a Button.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the _selectMonth function is called, which opens the month picker dialog.
// 6. The user selects a month, and if a month is selected, the state is updated to display the selected month on the screen.
