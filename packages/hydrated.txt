# Hydrated Flutter Package: A Comprehensive Overview

The **hydrated** package is a powerful state management solution for Flutter applications that allows developers to persist their app's state across sessions. This package is particularly useful when you want to maintain user preferences, form data, or any other stateful information even after the app is closed or restarted.

## When to Use Hydrated

- **User Preferences**: Store user settings like themes, language preferences, etc.
- **Form Data**: Keep track of user input in forms, so they don't lose their data if they navigate away.
- **Session Management**: Maintain user session data for a seamless experience.

## Key Features

- **Automatic State Persistence**: Automatically saves and restores state without manual intervention.
- **Simple API**: Easy to integrate and use with existing Flutter applications.
- **Reactive**: Works seamlessly with Flutter's reactive framework, ensuring UI updates on state changes.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS with no additional configuration needed.

The **hydrated** package is an excellent choice for developers looking to enhance their Flutter applications with persistent state management capabilities.

# Hydrated Package Tutorial: Setup and Usage

## Installation

To get started with the **hydrated** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  hydrated_bloc: ^8.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
  flutter_bloc: ^8.0.0    # Required for bloc support
```

After adding the dependencies, run the following command to install them:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the minimum deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0' # Ensure this is set to at least 10.0
```

## Basic Usage

1. **Create a Hydrated Bloc**: Extend the `HydratedBloc` class to create your own bloc that can persist its state.

2. **Initialize Hydrated Storage**: Before using the bloc, initialize the hydrated storage in the `main` function.

3. **Use the Bloc in Your App**: Wrap your app with the `BlocProvider` to provide the bloc to your widget tree.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set up a counter app using the **hydrated** package.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_bloc/flutter_bloc.dart';
import 'package:hydrated_bloc/hydrated_bloc.dart';
import 'package:path_provider/path_provider.dart';

// Step 1: Create a CounterEvent class to define events
abstract class CounterEvent {}

class Increment extends CounterEvent {}

// Step 2: Create a CounterState class to define states
class CounterState {
  final int count;

  CounterState(this.count);
}

// Step 3: Create a HydratedCounterBloc that extends HydratedBloc
class HydratedCounterBloc extends HydratedBloc<CounterEvent, CounterState> {
  HydratedCounterBloc() : super(CounterState(0)); // Initial state

  @override
  CounterState mapEventToState(CounterEvent event) {
    if (event is Increment) {
      return CounterState(state.count + 1); // Increment the count
    }
    return state; // Return current state if no event matches
  }

  @override
  CounterState fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) {
    return CounterState(json['count'] as int); // Deserialize state
  }

  @override
  Map<String, dynamic> toJson(CounterState state) {
    return {'count': state.count}; // Serialize state
  }
}

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized(); // Ensure Flutter is initialized
  final storage = await HydratedStorage.build(
      storageDirectory: await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()); // Initialize storage
  HydratedBlocOverrides.runZoned(
    () => runApp(MyApp()),
    storage: storage,
  );
}

// Step 4: Create the main application widget
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Hydrated Counter',
      home: BlocProvider(
        create: (context) => HydratedCounterBloc(), // Provide the bloc
        child: CounterPage(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Step 5: Create a CounterPage widget to display the UI
class CounterPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Hydrated Counter')),
      body: Center(
        child: BlocBuilder<HydratedCounterBloc, CounterState>(
          builder: (context, state) {
            return Text('Count: ${state.count}', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24)); // Display count
          },
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          context.read<HydratedCounterBloc>().add(Increment()); // Increment count on button press
        },
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, initializing the HydratedStorage.
// 2. The MyApp widget is created, which provides the HydratedCounterBloc to the widget tree.
// 3. The CounterPage widget displays the current count and has a button to increment it.
// 4. When the button is pressed, an Increment event is added to the bloc.
// 5. The bloc updates the state, which triggers a rebuild of the UI to reflect the new count.
// 6. The state is automatically persisted, so even if the app is closed, the count will be restored when reopened.
