# Cross Fade Flutter Package

The `cross_fade` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to create smooth transitions between two widgets. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to animate the visibility of one widget while fading in another, providing a seamless user experience. 

## When to Use

You might consider using the `cross_fade` package in the following scenarios:
- **Image Galleries**: Transitioning between images in a gallery view.
- **Content Switching**: Smoothly switching between different content views, such as tabs or sections in an app.
- **Loading States**: Fading in a loading indicator while fading out the previous content.

## Features
- **Customizable Duration**: Control the speed of the fade transition.
- **Alignment Options**: Specify how the widgets align during the transition.
- **Flexible Widget Types**: Use any widget as the fading content, not limited to images or text.

The `cross_fade` package enhances the visual appeal of your Flutter applications by providing a simple yet effective way to manage widget transitions.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Cross Fade Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `cross_fade` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cross_fade: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure your `ios/Podfile` has the platform version set to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Cross Fade Widget

You can now use the `CrossFade` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cross_fade/cross_fade.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Cross Fade Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: CrossFade(
            firstChild: Container(color: Colors.blue, width: 200, height: 200),
            secondChild: Container(color: Colors.red, width: 200, height: 200),
            crossFadeState: CrossFadeState.showFirst,
            duration: Duration(seconds: 1),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple app that fades between a blue and a red container. You can toggle the `crossFadeState` to switch between the two widgets.

# Complete Example of Cross Fade in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cross_fade/cross_fade.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // State variable to track which widget to show
  bool _showFirst = true;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Cross Fade Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // CrossFade widget to transition between two containers
              CrossFade(
                firstChild: Container(
                  color: Colors.blue,
                  width: 200,
                  height: 200,
                  child: Center(child: Text('First Widget', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white))),
                ),
                secondChild: Container(
                  color: Colors.red,
                  width: 200,
                  height: 200,
                  child: Center(child: Text('Second Widget', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white))),
                ),
                crossFadeState: _showFirst ? CrossFadeState.showFirst : CrossFadeState.showSecond,
                duration: Duration(seconds: 1), // Duration of the fade transition
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Button to toggle between the two widgets
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  setState(() {
                    _showFirst = !_showFirst; // Toggle the state
                  });
                },
                child: Text('Toggle Fade'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of which widget to show.
// 3. The build method constructs the UI, including a CrossFade widget and a button.
// 4. The CrossFade widget displays either a blue or red container based on the _showFirst state.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the state is toggled, causing the UI to rebuild and the CrossFade to animate the transition between the two containers.
