# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Clock Loader

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **clock_loader** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **clock_loader** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  clock_loader: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 3: Using the Clock Loader

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in a Flutter widget. Below is a simple example of how to implement the clock loader in your application.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:clock_loader/clock_loader.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Clock Loader Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ClockLoader(
            duration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Duration of the loading animation
            color: Colors.blue, // Color of the clock loader
            size: 100.0, // Size of the clock loader
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays the clock loader in the center of the screen. The loader will animate for 2 seconds with a blue color and a size of 100 pixels.

# Complete Example of Clock Loader

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:clock_loader/clock_loader.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Clock Loader Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Center widget to position the clock loader in the middle of the screen
          child: ClockLoader(
            duration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Duration of the loading animation
            color: Colors.blue, // Color of the clock loader
            size: 100.0, // Size of the clock loader
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  // Entry point of the application
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the Flutter application.
// 2. The runApp function takes the RealFlutter widget and makes it the root of the widget tree.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 4. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Clock Loader Example'.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold has a Center widget that centers its child.
// 6. The child of the Center widget is the ClockLoader, which displays a loading animation.
// 7. The ClockLoader is configured to animate for 2 seconds, with a blue color and a size of 100 pixels.
// 8. When the app runs, the clock loader will be displayed in the center of the screen, providing visual feedback during loading.
```

In summary, the **clock_loader** package is a powerful tool for enhancing user experience during loading states in Flutter applications. By following the setup and usage instructions provided, you can easily integrate this package into your projects and customize it to fit your design needs. The complete example demonstrates how to implement the clock loader effectively, ensuring that users receive clear feedback during asynchronous operations.
