# Setting Up and Using `lit_starfield`

In this section, we'll walk through the process of setting up the `lit_starfield` package in a Flutter project and demonstrate how to use it effectively.

## Setup Process

### Step 1: Add Dependency

First, add the `lit_starfield` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  lit_starfield: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:lit_starfield/lit_starfield.dart';
```

### Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android

Ensure your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

#### iOS

No specific configuration is required for iOS, but ensure your deployment target is set to iOS 9.0 or higher in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
```

### Step 4: Using `lit_starfield`

To use the `lit_starfield` package, wrap your widget tree with the `RealFlutter` widget provided by the package. Customize the starfield by setting properties like `starCount` and `speed`.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:lit_starfield/lit_starfield.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Starfield Demo',
      home: StarfieldScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class StarfieldScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Starfield Animation'),
      ),
      body: Stack(
        children: [
          // RealFlutter widget creates the starfield background
          RealFlutter(
            starCount: 100, // Number of stars in the field
            speed: 2.0, // Speed of star movement
          ),
          // Centered text widget on top of the starfield
          Center(
            child: Text(
              'Welcome to the Cosmos',
              style: TextStyle(
                color: Colors.white,
                fontSize: 24,
                fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The `main` function is the entry point of the Flutter application.
// `MyApp` is the root widget of the application, setting up the MaterialApp.
// `StarfieldScreen` is a StatelessWidget that represents the main screen.
// The `Scaffold` widget provides a structure for the app with an AppBar and a body.
// The `Stack` widget layers the `RealFlutter` starfield behind a centered text.
// `RealFlutter` is configured with `starCount` and `speed` to customize the starfield effect.
// The `Center` widget positions the text in the middle of the screen, overlaying the starfield.
