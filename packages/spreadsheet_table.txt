# Exploring the `spreadsheet_table` Flutter Package

The `spreadsheet_table` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to create spreadsheet-like interfaces within their applications. This package allows you to display tabular data in a highly customizable and interactive manner, making it ideal for applications that require data manipulation, such as inventory management systems, financial applications, or any app that needs to present data in a grid format.

## Key Features
- **Customizable Cells**: You can define the appearance and behavior of each cell, including text styles, colors, and more.
- **Editable Cells**: Users can interact with the cells to edit data directly, making it suitable for applications that require user input.
- **Scrolling Support**: The package supports both horizontal and vertical scrolling, allowing for large datasets to be displayed without compromising usability.
- **Row and Column Management**: Easily add, remove, or modify rows and columns dynamically.
- **Data Formatting**: Supports various data types, including text, numbers, and dates, with formatting options available.

## When to Use
Consider using the `spreadsheet_table` package when:
- You need to display large datasets in a structured format.
- Your application requires user interaction with data (editing, adding, or deleting).
- You want to provide a familiar spreadsheet-like experience to users.

Overall, the `spreadsheet_table` package is a versatile solution for any Flutter application that needs to handle tabular data efficiently.

# Setting Up and Using the `spreadsheet_table` Package

## Installation
To get started with the `spreadsheet_table` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  spreadsheet_table: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/spreadsheet_table). After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
Once the package is installed, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a basic spreadsheet table.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:spreadsheet_table/spreadsheet_table.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Spreadsheet Table Example')),
        body: SpreadsheetTable(
          rows: [
            ['Header 1', 'Header 2', 'Header 3'],
            ['Row 1 Col 1', 'Row 1 Col 2', 'Row 1 Col 3'],
            ['Row 2 Col 1', 'Row 2 Col 2', 'Row 2 Col 3'],
          ],
          onCellTap: (row, col) {
            // Handle cell tap
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple spreadsheet table with three columns and two rows of data. The `onCellTap` callback allows you to handle user interactions with the cells.

With this setup, you are ready to start building more complex tables and integrating them into your Flutter applications.

import 'package:spreadsheet_table/spreadsheet_table.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Spreadsheet Table Example')),
        body: SpreadsheetTable(
          // Define the rows of the spreadsheet
          rows: [
            ['Name', 'Age', 'Occupation'], // Header row
            ['Alice', '30', 'Engineer'],    // Data row 1
            ['Bob', '25', 'Designer'],       // Data row 2
            ['Charlie', '35', 'Teacher'],    // Data row 3
          ],
          // Callback for when a cell is tapped
          onCellTap: (row, col) {
            // Display a dialog with the cell's content
            showDialog(
              context: context,
              builder: (context) {
                return AlertDialog(
                  title: Text('Cell Tapped'),
                  content: Text('You tapped on Row: $row, Column: $col'),
                  actions: [
                    TextButton(
                      onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                      child: Text('Close'),
                    ),
                  ],
                );
              },
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which calls runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a body.
// 3. The body contains a SpreadsheetTable widget, which is initialized with a list of rows.
// 4. The first row is the header, and the subsequent rows contain data.
// 5. The onCellTap callback is defined to show a dialog when a cell is tapped, displaying the row and column indices.
// 6. The user can interact with the table, and upon tapping a cell, a dialog will appear with the relevant information.
