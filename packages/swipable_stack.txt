# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Swipable Stack Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **swipable_stack** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  swipable_stack: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/swipable_stack).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter and the package:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:swipable_stack/swipable_stack.dart';
```

## Step 4: Basic Usage

You can now use the `SwipableStack` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
SwipableStack(
  children: [
    // Add your widgets here
  ],
  onSwipe: (index, direction) {
    // Handle swipe actions
  },
);
```

This basic setup allows you to create a stack of widgets that users can swipe through. You can customize the behavior further by exploring the package documentation.

# Complete Example of Swipable Stack

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:swipable_stack/swipable_stack.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Swipable Stack Example',
      home: SwipableStackDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class SwipableStackDemo extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Swipable Stack Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: SwipableStack(
          // Define the stack of cards
          children: [
            CardWidget(color: Colors.red, text: 'Card 1'),
            CardWidget(color: Colors.green, text: 'Card 2'),
            CardWidget(color: Colors.blue, text: 'Card 3'),
          ],
          // Handle swipe actions
          onSwipe: (index, direction) {
            // Print the index of the swiped card and the direction
            print('Swiped card index: $index, direction: $direction');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Custom widget for the cards
class CardWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  final Color color;
  final String text;

  CardWidget({required this.color, required this.text});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Card(
      color: color,
      child: Center(
        child: Text(
          text,
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.white),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets MyApp as the root widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets SwipableStackDemo as the home widget.
// 3. SwipableStackDemo creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a SwipableStack is created with three CardWidgets as children.
// 5. The onSwipe callback is defined to print the index and direction of the swiped card.
// 6. Each CardWidget displays a colored card with text in the center, enhancing the visual appeal of the stack.
