# Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `flutter_user_agentx` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_user_agentx: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_user_agentx/flutter_user_agentx.dart';
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions. Typically, no special permissions are required for this package, but it's good practice to check for any updates in the documentation.

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `Info.plist` file to ensure proper functionality:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the package in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to retrieve and display the user agent string:

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized(); // Ensure Flutter is initialized
  String userAgent = await FlutterUserAgent.getUserAgent(); // Get the user agent
  runApp(MyApp(userAgent: userAgent)); // Pass the user agent to the app
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  final String userAgent;

  MyApp({required this.userAgent});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('User Agent Example')),
        body: Center(child: Text('User Agent: $userAgent')),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code initializes the Flutter application, retrieves the user agent string, and displays it on the screen.

# Complete Example of flutter_user_agentx

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_user_agentx/flutter_user_agentx.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized(); // Ensures that Flutter is initialized before running the app
  String userAgent = await FlutterUserAgent.getUserAgent(); // Asynchronously fetches the user agent string
  runApp(MyApp(userAgent: userAgent)); // Starts the app and passes the user agent string
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  final String userAgent; // Variable to hold the user agent string

  MyApp({required this.userAgent}); // Constructor to initialize the user agent

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('User Agent Example')), // App bar with title
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center, // Center the content vertically
            children: <Widget>[
              Text('User Agent:', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20)), // Label for user agent
              SizedBox(height: 10), // Space between label and user agent
              Text(userAgent, style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16)), // Display the user agent string
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized() ensures that the Flutter framework is fully initialized.
// 3. The user agent string is fetched asynchronously using FlutterUserAgent.getUserAgent().
// 4. The MyApp widget is created and the user agent string is passed to it.
// 5. In the MyApp widget, a MaterialApp is built with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 6. The Center widget contains a Column that displays the user agent string in a user-friendly format.
```
