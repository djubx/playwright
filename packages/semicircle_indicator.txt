# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Semicircle Indicator

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `semicircle_indicator` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  semicircle_indicator: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Semicircle Indicator

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the semicircle indicator in your widget tree:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:semicircle_indicator/semicircle_indicator.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Semicircle Indicator Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: SemicircleIndicator(
          totalValue: 100,
          currentValue: 75,
          // Customize the appearance
          backgroundColor: Colors.grey[300],
          indicatorColor: Colors.blue,
          // Add more customization options as needed
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code creates a simple application with a semicircle indicator showing 75 out of 100.

# Complete Example of Semicircle Indicator

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:semicircle_indicator/semicircle_indicator.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Semicircle Indicator Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Semicircle Indicator Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: SemicircleIndicator(
          totalValue: 100, // Total value for the indicator
          currentValue: 75, // Current value to display
          backgroundColor: Colors.grey[300], // Background color of the indicator
          indicatorColor: Colors.blue, // Color of the progress indicator
          // Additional customization options can be added here
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to RealFlutter, which is the main screen of the app.
// 4. In RealFlutter, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a SemicircleIndicator is instantiated.
// 6. The SemicircleIndicator takes totalValue and currentValue to display the progress.
// 7. The backgroundColor and indicatorColor properties allow customization of the indicator's appearance.
// 8. The app displays a semicircle progress indicator showing 75 out of 100, providing a visual representation of progress.
