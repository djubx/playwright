# Webthree Flutter Package: A Comprehensive Overview

The **webthree** Flutter package is designed to facilitate the integration of Web3 functionalities into Flutter applications. It provides developers with the tools necessary to interact with blockchain networks, enabling features such as wallet connections, smart contract interactions, and decentralized application (dApp) functionalities. 

## When to Use Webthree
You should consider using the webthree package when:
- You are building a decentralized application (dApp) that requires blockchain interactions.
- You need to connect to Ethereum or other EVM-compatible networks.
- You want to implement wallet functionalities, such as connecting to MetaMask or other wallet providers.

## Key Features
- **Wallet Integration**: Easily connect to popular wallets like MetaMask.
- **Smart Contract Interaction**: Call functions and send transactions to smart contracts.
- **Event Listening**: Listen for events emitted by smart contracts.
- **Network Management**: Switch between different blockchain networks seamlessly.

The webthree package simplifies the process of building blockchain-enabled applications, making it a valuable tool for Flutter developers looking to leverage the power of decentralized technologies.

# Setting Up and Using the Webthree Package

## Installation
To get started with the webthree package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  webthree: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/webthree).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following configurations:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions to allow network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the webthree package, you will typically follow these steps:
1. Import the package in your Dart file.
2. Initialize the Web3 instance.
3. Connect to a wallet.
4. Interact with smart contracts.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set up a connection to a wallet:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:webthree/webthree.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late Web3 web3;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the Web3 instance
    web3 = Web3();
  }

  // Function to connect to the wallet
  Future<void> connectWallet() async {
    try {
      await web3.connect();
      // Wallet connected successfully
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle connection error
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Webthree Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: connectWallet,
          child: Text('Connect Wallet'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application that connects to a wallet using the webthree package. The `connectWallet` function is called when the button is pressed, initiating the wallet connection process.

# Complete Example of Webthree in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:webthree/webthree.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late Web3 web3; // Declare a Web3 instance
  String walletAddress = ''; // Variable to store the wallet address

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the Web3 instance
    web3 = Web3();
  }

  // Function to connect to the wallet
  Future<void> connectWallet() async {
    try {
      // Attempt to connect to the wallet
      await web3.connect();
      // Retrieve the connected wallet address
      walletAddress = await web3.getWalletAddress();
      setState(() {}); // Update the UI with the new wallet address
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle connection error
      print('Error connecting to wallet: $e');
    }
  }

  // Function to send a transaction
  Future<void> sendTransaction() async {
    try {
      // Define the transaction parameters
      final transaction = Transaction(
        to: '0xRecipientAddress', // Replace with the recipient's address
        value: BigInt.from(1000000000000000000), // Amount in wei
      );
      // Send the transaction
      await web3.sendTransaction(transaction);
      print('Transaction sent successfully!');
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle transaction error
      print('Error sending transaction: $e');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Webthree Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: connectWallet,
              child: Text('Connect Wallet'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(walletAddress.isNotEmpty ? 'Wallet: $walletAddress' : 'No wallet connected'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: sendTransaction,
              child: Text('Send Transaction'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation
// The application starts by initializing the Web3 instance in the initState method.
// When the user presses the "Connect Wallet" button, the connectWallet function is called.
// This function attempts to connect to the user's wallet and retrieves the wallet address.
// If successful, the wallet address is displayed on the screen.
// The user can then press the "Send Transaction" button to initiate a transaction.
// The sendTransaction function defines the transaction parameters and sends the transaction to the specified address.
// Any errors during connection or transaction sending are caught and printed to the console.
