# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Flutter Profile Picture Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_profile_picture` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_profile_picture` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_profile_picture: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is an example of how to implement the `flutter_profile_picture` package in your app.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_profile_picture/flutter_profile_picture.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Profile Picture Example',
      home: ProfilePictureDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class ProfilePictureDemo extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Profile Picture Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display a profile picture with initials
            ProfilePicture(
              name: 'John Doe', // User's name for initials
              radius: 50, // Radius of the profile picture
              fontsize: 24, // Font size of the initials
              backgroundColor: Colors.blue, // Background color
              initialsBackgroundColor: Colors.grey, // Color for initials background
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between profile pictures
            // Display a profile picture with a custom image
            ProfilePicture(
              image: NetworkImage('https://example.com/profile.jpg'), // User's profile image URL
              radius: 50, // Radius of the profile picture
              backgroundColor: Colors.blue, // Background color
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets ProfilePictureDemo as the home widget.
// 3. ProfilePictureDemo builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange two ProfilePicture widgets vertically.
// 5. The first ProfilePicture displays initials for 'John Doe' with a blue background.
// 6. The second ProfilePicture displays an image from a network URL with a blue background.
// 7. The app demonstrates how to use both initials and images for user profiles.
```
