# Tutorial: Setting Up the Counter Button Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To use the **counter_button** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  counter_button: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install the Package
Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Import the Package
In your Dart file where you want to use the counter button, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:counter_button/counter_button.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Counter Button
You can now use the `CounterButton` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
CounterButton(
  onTap: (int val) {
    print(val); // This will print the current value of the counter
  },
  count: 0, // Initial count
  step: 1, // Step value for increment/decrement
  buttonColor: Colors.blue, // Button color
  iconSize: 30, // Size of the icons
  // Additional customization options can be added here
)
```

With these steps, you are now ready to use the **counter_button** package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Using the Counter Button Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:counter_button/counter_button.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Counter Button Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Counter Button Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: CounterExample(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class CounterExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CounterExampleState createState() => _CounterExampleState();
}

class _CounterExampleState extends State<CounterExample> {
  int _count = 0; // Initialize the counter value

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Text(
          'Current Count: $_count', // Display the current count
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20), // Add some space
        CounterButton(
          onTap: (int val) {
            setState(() {
              _count = val; // Update the count when the button is tapped
            });
          },
          count: _count, // Pass the current count
          step: 1, // Increment/decrement by 1
          buttonColor: Colors.blue, // Set button color
          iconSize: 30, // Set icon size
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds the CounterExample.
// 4. CounterExample is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the counter.
// 5. The _count variable is initialized to 0 and displayed in a Text widget.
// 6. The CounterButton widget is used to create the counter button.
// 7. When the button is tapped, the onTap callback updates the _count variable.
// 8. The UI is rebuilt to reflect the updated count.
```
