# Setting Up and Using the Flutter Shimmer Package
=====================================================

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_shimmer/flutter_shimmer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Shimmer Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),

  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  bool _isLoading = true;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Simulate loading data
    Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3), () {
      setState(() {
        _isLoading = false;
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Shimmer Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: _isLoading
            ? Shimmer(
                color: Colors.grey,
                duration: Duration(milliseconds: 1000),
                direction: ShimmerDirection.ltr,
                child: Text('Loading...'),
              )
            : Text('Data loaded!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application flow:
// 1. The app starts and displays a shimmering effect on the screen.
// 2. The app simulates loading data for 3 seconds.
// 3. After 3 seconds, the app sets the `_isLoading` flag to `false`.
// 4. The app rebuilds the UI and displays the "Data loaded!" text instead of the shimmering effect.
