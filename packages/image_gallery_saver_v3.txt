# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Image Gallery Saver V3

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `image_gallery_saver_v3` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  image_gallery_saver_v3: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/image_gallery_saver_v3).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request permission to access the photo library:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save images.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need permission to save images to your photo library.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that the package is set up, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to save an image:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:image_gallery_saver_v3/image_gallery_saver_v3.dart';
import 'package:flutter/services.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Image Gallery Saver Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Load an image from assets
              ByteData bytes = await rootBundle.load('assets/sample_image.png');
              List<int> imageData = bytes.buffer.asUint8List();

              // Save the image to the gallery
              final result = await ImageGallerySaver.saveImage(Uint8List.fromList(imageData));
              print(result); // Log the result
            },
            child: Text('Save Image'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, an image is loaded from the assets and saved to the gallery.

# Complete Example: RealFlutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:image_gallery_saver_v3/image_gallery_saver_v3.dart';
import 'package:flutter/services.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Image Gallery Saver Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Load an image from assets
              ByteData bytes = await rootBundle.load('assets/sample_image.png');
              List<int> imageData = bytes.buffer.asUint8List();

              // Save the image to the gallery
              final result = await ImageGallerySaver.saveImage(Uint8List.fromList(imageData));
              print(result); // Log the result
            },
            child: Text('Save Image'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. An AppBar is created with the title 'Image Gallery Saver Example'.
// 4. The body contains a Center widget with an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, it loads an image from the assets using rootBundle.
// 6. The image data is converted to a Uint8List and saved to the gallery using ImageGallerySaver.
// 7. The result of the save operation is printed to the console for debugging.
```
