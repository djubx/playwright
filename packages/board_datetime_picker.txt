# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Board Datetime Picker

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `board_datetime_picker` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  board_datetime_picker: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if your app requires access to the user's calendar or reminders. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSCalendarsUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your calendar.</string>
<key>NSRemindersUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your reminders.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `board_datetime_picker` in your app.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:board_datetime_picker/board_datetime_picker.dart'; // Import the package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the main app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Board Datetime Picker Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: DateTimePickerScreen(), // Set the home screen
    );
  }
}

class DateTimePickerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DateTimePickerScreenState createState() => _DateTimePickerScreenState();
}

class _DateTimePickerScreenState extends State<DateTimePickerScreen> {
  DateTime? selectedDate; // Variable to hold the selected date
  TimeOfDay? selectedTime; // Variable to hold the selected time

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('DateTime Picker Example'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display selected date
            Text(
              selectedDate != null
                  ? 'Selected Date: ${selectedDate!.toLocal()}'.split(' ')[0]
                  : 'No Date Selected',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Display selected time
            Text(
              selectedTime != null
                  ? 'Selected Time: ${selectedTime!.hour}:${selectedTime!.minute}'
                  : 'No Time Selected',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to pick date
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () async {
                // Show date picker
                DateTime? date = await showDatePicker(
                  context: context,
                  initialDate: selectedDate ?? DateTime.now(),
                  firstDate: DateTime(2000),
                  lastDate: DateTime(2101),
                );
                if (date != null) {
                  setState(() {
                    selectedDate = date; // Update selected date
                  });
                }
              },
              child: Text('Pick Date'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to pick time
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () async {
                // Show time picker
                TimeOfDay? time = await showTimePicker(
                  context: context,
                  initialTime: selectedTime ?? TimeOfDay.now(),
                );
                if (time != null) {
                  setState(() {
                    selectedTime = time; // Update selected time
                  });
                }
              },
              child: Text('Pick Time'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application using the board_datetime_picker package.
// 
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter class.
// 2. The RealFlutter class sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The DateTimePickerScreen is the main screen where users can select a date and time.
// 4. The selectedDate and selectedTime variables hold the user's selections.
// 5. The build method constructs the UI, displaying the selected date and time, and providing buttons to pick them.
// 6. When the user presses the "Pick Date" button, a date picker dialog appears, allowing them to select a date.
// 7. Similarly, pressing the "Pick Time" button opens a time picker dialog.
// 8. The selected date and time are displayed on the screen, updating dynamically as the user makes selections.
// 
// This flow provides a straightforward way for users to select dates and times, enhancing the app's functionality.
