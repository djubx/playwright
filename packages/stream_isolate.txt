# Stream Isolate: A Flutter Package for Efficient Data Processing

The `stream_isolate` package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who need to handle heavy computations or data processing without blocking the main UI thread. By leveraging Dart's isolate feature, this package allows you to run tasks in a separate thread, ensuring that your app remains responsive even during intensive operations.

## When to Use `stream_isolate`

- **Heavy Computation**: When your application requires complex calculations that could freeze the UI.
- **Data Processing**: For tasks like parsing large JSON files or processing images.
- **Real-time Data Handling**: When you need to handle streams of data efficiently without impacting the user experience.

## Key Features

- **Isolate Management**: Simplifies the creation and management of isolates.
- **Stream Support**: Allows you to work with streams of data, making it easier to handle asynchronous operations.
- **Error Handling**: Provides mechanisms to catch and handle errors that occur in isolates.

Overall, `stream_isolate` is an excellent choice for Flutter developers looking to improve the performance of their applications by offloading heavy tasks to separate threads.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `stream_isolate`

## Installation

To add the `stream_isolate` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  stream_isolate: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/stream_isolate).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, no specific configurations are required for using isolates. However, ensure that your deployment target is set appropriately in your `ios/Podfile`.

## Using the Package

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the `stream_isolate` package in your Flutter application:

1. Import the package:

```dart
import 'package:stream_isolate/stream_isolate.dart';
```

2. Create a function that will run in the isolate:

```dart
Future<String> computeHeavyTask(String input) async {
  // Simulate a heavy computation
  await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));
  return 'Processed: $input';
}
```

3. Use the `StreamIsolate` to run the function:

```dart
void startIsolate() async {
  final isolate = StreamIsolate<String, String>(
    computeHeavyTask,
  );

  // Listen for results
  isolate.stream.listen((result) {
    print(result); // Handle the result from the isolate
  });

  // Send data to the isolate
  isolate.send('Hello, World!');
}
```

This setup allows you to offload the `computeHeavyTask` function to a separate isolate, keeping your UI responsive while the computation is performed.

# Complete Example of Using `stream_isolate`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:stream_isolate/stream_isolate.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Stream Isolate Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Stream Isolate Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              startIsolate(); // Start the isolate when the button is pressed
            },
            child: Text('Start Heavy Task'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Function to run a heavy task in an isolate
Future<String> computeHeavyTask(String input) async {
  // Simulate a heavy computation
  await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2)); // Simulate delay
  return 'Processed: $input'; // Return the processed result
}

// Function to start the isolate and handle data
void startIsolate() async {
  // Create a StreamIsolate instance with the heavy task function
  final isolate = StreamIsolate<String, String>(
    computeHeavyTask,
  );

  // Listen for results from the isolate
  isolate.stream.listen((result) {
    print(result); // Print the result received from the isolate
  });

  // Send data to the isolate for processing
  isolate.send('Hello, World!'); // Send input to the isolate
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The app starts with a button labeled "Start Heavy Task".
2. When the button is pressed, the `startIsolate` function is called.
3. Inside `startIsolate`, a new `StreamIsolate` is created, passing the `computeHeavyTask` function.
4. The app listens for results from the isolate using `isolate.stream.listen`.
5. The input string 'Hello, World!' is sent to the isolate for processing.
6. The `computeHeavyTask` function simulates a heavy computation by delaying for 2 seconds.
7. After the delay, it returns the processed result, which is then printed to the console.
8. The UI remains responsive throughout the process, demonstrating the effectiveness of using isolates for heavy tasks.
