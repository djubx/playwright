# Clear All Notifications Flutter Package

The `clear_all_notifications` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to help developers manage notifications in their Flutter applications. This package provides a simple and efficient way to clear all notifications from the notification tray, enhancing user experience by allowing users to reset their notification state easily.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the `clear_all_notifications` package in scenarios such as:
- **User Logout**: When a user logs out of your application, you may want to clear all notifications related to that user.
- **Notification Management**: In applications where notifications are frequently updated or changed, clearing old notifications can help keep the notification tray clean and relevant.
- **User Preferences**: Allowing users to clear notifications manually can be a useful feature in apps that rely heavily on notifications.

## Features
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Simple API**: Easy to integrate with minimal setup.
- **Customizable**: You can extend its functionality based on your app's requirements.

This package is particularly useful for applications that require dynamic notification management and want to provide a clean user interface.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Clear All Notifications Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `clear_all_notifications` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  clear_all_notifications: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Ensure you have the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to request permission for notifications:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>fetch</string>
    <string>remote-notification</string>
</array>
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:clear_all_notifications/clear_all_notifications.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the `clear_all_notifications` package in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to clear notifications:

```dart
void clearNotifications() async {
  await ClearAllNotifications.clearAll();
}
```

This function can be called whenever you want to clear the notifications, such as on a button press or during a specific event in your app.

# Complete Example of Using Clear All Notifications

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:clear_all_notifications/clear_all_notifications.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Clear All Notifications Example',
      home: NotificationHome(),
    );
  }
}

class NotificationHome extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Clear Notifications Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Call the function to clear all notifications
            clearNotifications();
          },
          child: Text('Clear All Notifications'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to clear all notifications
  void clearNotifications() async {
    // Await the clearAll method from the package
    await ClearAllNotifications.clearAll();
    // Show a snackbar to inform the user
    ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
      SnackBar(content: Text('All notifications cleared!')),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget NotificationHome.
// 3. NotificationHome contains a button that, when pressed, calls the clearNotifications function.
// 4. The clearNotifications function uses the clearAll method from the clear_all_notifications package to clear notifications.
// 5. After clearing notifications, a snackbar is displayed to inform the user that all notifications have been cleared.
