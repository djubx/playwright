# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Formatted Text Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `formatted_text` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  formatted_text: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the `formatted_text` package to display styled text.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:formatted_text/formatted_text.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Formatted Text Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: FormattedText(
            text: 'This is [bold]bold[/bold] and this is [italic]italic[/italic].',
            styles: {
              'bold': TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
              'italic': TextStyle(fontStyle: FontStyle.italic),
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that displays formatted text. The `FormattedText` widget takes a string with special markers (like `[bold]` and `[italic]`) and applies the corresponding styles defined in the `styles` map.

# Complete Example of Using the Formatted Text Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:formatted_text/formatted_text.dart';

// Main class of the Flutter application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Formatted Text Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: FormattedText(
            // The text to be displayed with formatting
            text: 'This is [bold]bold[/bold] and this is [italic]italic[/italic].',
            styles: {
              // Defining styles for bold and italic text
              'bold': TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
              'italic': TextStyle(fontStyle: FontStyle.italic),
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp().
// 2. The RealFlutter class is instantiated, which builds the MaterialApp widget.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, the FormattedText widget is used to display text.
// 5. The text contains markers for bold and italic styles, which are defined in the styles map.
// 6. The formatted text is rendered on the screen with the specified styles applied.
```

In summary, the `formatted_text` package provides a straightforward way to display rich text in Flutter applications. By following the setup and usage instructions, you can easily integrate formatted text into your projects, enhancing the user experience with visually appealing text presentations.
