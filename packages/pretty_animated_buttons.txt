# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Pretty Animated Buttons

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **pretty_animated_buttons** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **pretty_animated_buttons** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  pretty_animated_buttons: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a pretty animated button.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pretty_animated_buttons/pretty_animated_buttons.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Pretty Animated Buttons Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: PrettyAnimatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Action to perform on button press
              print('Button Pressed!');
            },
            child: Text('Click Me'),
            // Customize the button style
            color: Colors.blue,
            textColor: Colors.white,
            borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(30),
            duration: Duration(milliseconds: 300),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with a single animated button. The button changes its appearance when pressed, providing visual feedback to the user.

# Complete Example of Pretty Animated Buttons

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pretty_animated_buttons/pretty_animated_buttons.dart';

// Main class for the Flutter application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Pretty Animated Buttons Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: PrettyAnimatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Action to perform on button press
              print('Button Pressed!');
            },
            child: Text('Click Me'),
            // Customize the button style
            color: Colors.blue,
            textColor: Colors.white,
            borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(30),
            duration: Duration(milliseconds: 300),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp().
// 2. The RealFlutter class is instantiated, which builds the MaterialApp widget.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a PrettyAnimatedButton is created.
// 5. When the button is pressed, it triggers the onPressed callback, printing 'Button Pressed!' to the console.
// 6. The button has a blue background, white text, and rounded corners, with a smooth animation duration of 300 milliseconds.
