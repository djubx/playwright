# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Pix Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **pix_flutter** package and demonstrate how to use its features effectively.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **pix_flutter** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  pix_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/pix_flutter).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions to allow image access:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to edit images.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to take photos.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to load an image, apply a filter, and display the result.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pix_flutter/pix_flutter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: ImageEditor(),
    );
  }
}

class ImageEditor extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ImageEditorState createState() => _ImageEditorState();
}

class _ImageEditorState extends State<ImageEditor> {
  // Variable to hold the original image
  Image? originalImage;
  // Variable to hold the processed image
  Image? processedImage;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Load an image from assets
    loadImage();
  }

  void loadImage() {
    // Load the image from assets
    originalImage = Image.asset('assets/sample_image.jpg');
    // Process the image with a filter
    applyFilter();
  }

  void applyFilter() {
    // Apply a filter to the original image
    processedImage = Pix.applyFilter(originalImage, FilterType.sepia);
    // Update the UI
    setState(() {});
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Image Editor')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the original image
            originalImage ?? Container(),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Display the processed image
            processedImage ?? Container(),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Pix Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pix_flutter/pix_flutter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: ImageEditor(),
    );
  }
}

class ImageEditor extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ImageEditorState createState() => _ImageEditorState();
}

class _ImageEditorState extends State<ImageEditor> {
  // Variable to hold the original image
  Image? originalImage;
  // Variable to hold the processed image
  Image? processedImage;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Load an image from assets
    loadImage();
  }

  void loadImage() {
    // Load the image from assets
    originalImage = Image.asset('assets/sample_image.jpg');
    // Process the image with a filter
    applyFilter();
  }

  void applyFilter() {
    // Apply a filter to the original image
    processedImage = Pix.applyFilter(originalImage, FilterType.sepia);
    // Update the UI
    setState(() {});
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Image Editor')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the original image
            originalImage ?? Container(),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Display the processed image
            processedImage ?? Container(),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The ImageEditor widget is created, which manages the state of the images.
// 3. In the initState method, loadImage() is called to load the original image from assets.
// 4. The applyFilter() method is called to apply a sepia filter to the original image.
// 5. The UI is updated to display both the original and processed images.
// 6. The images are displayed in a column layout, with a space in between.
```
