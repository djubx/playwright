# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Files Uploader Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **files_uploader** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  files_uploader: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request permission for file access:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to upload files.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to upload files.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio uploads.</string>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that you have configured your project, you can start using the **files_uploader** package in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement file uploading.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:files_uploader/files_uploader.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Files Uploader Example')),
        body: FileUploaderWidget(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class FileUploaderWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _FileUploaderWidgetState createState() => _FileUploaderWidgetState();
}

class _FileUploaderWidgetState extends State<FileUploaderWidget> {
  List<File> _files = [];

  void _uploadFiles() {
    // Implement the upload logic here
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Trigger file selection
          },
          child: Text('Select Files'),
        ),
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _uploadFiles,
          child: Text('Upload Files'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple UI with buttons to select and upload files. The `_uploadFiles` method will contain the logic for handling the file upload process.

# Complete Example of Files Uploader

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:files_uploader/files_uploader.dart';
import 'dart:io';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Files Uploader Example')),
        body: FileUploaderWidget(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class FileUploaderWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _FileUploaderWidgetState createState() => _FileUploaderWidgetState();
}

class _FileUploaderWidgetState extends State<FileUploaderWidget> {
  List<File> _files = []; // List to hold selected files
  double _progress = 0.0; // Variable to track upload progress

  // Method to handle file selection
  void _selectFiles() async {
    // Use file picker to select files
    // Add selected files to _files list
  }

  // Method to upload files
  void _uploadFiles() {
    // Loop through each file and upload
    for (var file in _files) {
      // Call the upload function from files_uploader package
      FilesUploader.upload(file).then((response) {
        // Handle successful upload
        setState(() {
          _progress = response.progress; // Update progress
        });
      }).catchError((error) {
        // Handle upload error
        print('Error uploading file: $error');
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _selectFiles, // Trigger file selection
          child: Text('Select Files'),
        ),
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _uploadFiles, // Trigger file upload
          child: Text('Upload Files'),
        ),
        LinearProgressIndicator(value: _progress), // Show upload progress
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which sets up the MaterialApp and the main UI.
// 2. The FileUploaderWidget is created, which contains the logic for file selection and uploading.
// 3. When the user clicks 'Select Files', the _selectFiles method is called to allow file selection.
// 4. The selected files are stored in the _files list.
// 5. When the user clicks 'Upload Files', the _uploadFiles method is called.
// 6. Each file in the _files list is uploaded using the FilesUploader.upload method.
// 7. The upload progress is tracked and displayed using a LinearProgressIndicator.
// 8. Any errors during the upload process are caught and printed to the console.
```
