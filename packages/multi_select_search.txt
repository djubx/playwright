# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Multi Select Search

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `multi_select_search` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `multi_select_search` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  multi_select_search: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/multi_select_search).

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:multi_select_search/multi_select_search.dart';
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` if you are accessing any device features. However, for basic usage of the `multi_select_search` package, no additional configurations are typically required.

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the `MultiSelectSearch` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
MultiSelectSearch(
  items: [
    'Apple',
    'Banana',
    'Cherry',
    'Date',
    'Elderberry',
    'Fig',
    'Grape',
  ],
  onChanged: (selectedItems) {
    // Handle the selected items
    print(selectedItems);
  },
  label: 'Select Fruits',
  hint: 'Search for fruits',
),
```

This widget will display a searchable dropdown where users can select multiple fruits from the list.

## Step 5: Customization

You can customize the appearance of the dropdown and the selected items by using various properties provided by the `MultiSelectSearch` widget. Check the package documentation for more details on customization options.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the `multi_select_search` package into your Flutter application seamlessly.

# Complete Example of Multi Select Search

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:multi_select_search/multi_select_search.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Multi Select Search Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Multi Select Search Example'),
        ),
        body: MultiSelectSearchExample(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MultiSelectSearchExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MultiSelectSearchExampleState createState() => _MultiSelectSearchExampleState();
}

class _MultiSelectSearchExampleState extends State<MultiSelectSearchExample> {
  List<String> selectedItems = []; // List to hold selected items

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
      child: Column(
        children: [
          // MultiSelectSearch widget for selecting fruits
          MultiSelectSearch(
            items: [
              'Apple',
              'Banana',
              'Cherry',
              'Date',
              'Elderberry',
              'Fig',
              'Grape',
            ],
            onChanged: (items) {
              setState(() {
                selectedItems = items; // Update selected items
              });
            },
            label: 'Select Fruits',
            hint: 'Search for fruits',
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20),
          // Display selected items
          Text('Selected Fruits: ${selectedItems.join(', ')}'),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home scaffold containing an AppBar and the MultiSelectSearchExample widget.
// 3. MultiSelectSearchExample is a stateful widget that maintains a list of selected items.
// 4. The MultiSelectSearch widget is displayed, allowing users to search and select multiple fruits.
// 5. When items are selected, the onChanged callback updates the selectedItems list and triggers a rebuild to display the selected fruits below the dropdown.
