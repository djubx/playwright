# Tutorial: Setting Up the Dog Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **dog** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **dog** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dog: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the **dog** package to start using its features:

```dart
import 'package:dog/dog.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the **dog** package to fetch dog breeds and images. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to fetch and display a random dog image:

```dart
void fetchRandomDogImage() async {
  final dogImage = await Dog.getRandomImage();
  print(dogImage);
}
```

This function fetches a random dog image and prints the URL to the console.

With these steps, you are now ready to integrate the **dog** package into your Flutter application!

# Complete Example: Using the Dog Package

Below is a complete Flutter application that demonstrates the key features of the **dog** package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dog/dog.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dog App',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: DogHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class DogHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DogHomePageState createState() => _DogHomePageState();
}

class _DogHomePageState extends State<DogHomePage> {
  String _dogImageUrl = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _fetchRandomDogImage(); // Fetch a random dog image when the app starts
  }

  // Function to fetch a random dog image
  void _fetchRandomDogImage() async {
    final dogImage = await Dog.getRandomImage(); // Call the package method
    setState(() {
      _dogImageUrl = dogImage; // Update the state with the new image URL
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Random Dog Image'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: _dogImageUrl.isNotEmpty
            ? Column(
                mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
                children: [
                  Image.network(_dogImageUrl), // Display the dog image
                  SizedBox(height: 20),
                  ElevatedButton(
                    onPressed: _fetchRandomDogImage, // Fetch a new image on button press
                    child: Text('Get Another Dog Image'),
                  ),
                ],
              )
            : CircularProgressIndicator(), // Show loading indicator while fetching
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme, and sets DogHomePage as the home widget.
// 3. DogHomePage is a stateful widget that fetches a random dog image in its initState method.
// 4. The _fetchRandomDogImage method calls the Dog package to get a random image and updates the state.
// 5. The build method displays the dog image and a button to fetch another image.
// 6. When the button is pressed, it calls _fetchRandomDogImage again to get a new image.
```
