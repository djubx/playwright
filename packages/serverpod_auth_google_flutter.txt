# Tutorial: Setting Up serverpod_auth_google_flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `serverpod_auth_google_flutter` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

First, add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  serverpod_auth_google_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Configure Google Cloud Console

### For Android

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create a new project or select an existing one.
3. Navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
4. Click on **Create Credentials** and select **OAuth 2.0 Client IDs**.
5. Configure the consent screen and add your app's package name and SHA-1 certificate fingerprint.
6. Save the generated Client ID.

### For iOS

1. In the same project, navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
2. Create another OAuth 2.0 Client ID for iOS.
3. Set the bundle identifier to match your Flutter app's bundle identifier.
4. Save the generated Client ID.

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and add the following to the `defaultConfig` section:

```groovy
manifestPlaceholders = [
    'appAuthRedirectScheme': 'your.package.name'
]
```

Replace `your.package.name` with your actual package name.

2. Ensure you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
  <dict>
    <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
    <array>
      <string>com.googleusercontent.apps.YOUR_CLIENT_ID</string>
    </array>
  </dict>
</array>
```

Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` with your actual iOS Client ID.

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a complete example demonstrating how to implement Google authentication.

# Complete Example of serverpod_auth_google_flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:serverpod_auth_google_flutter/serverpod_auth_google_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Google Auth Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: AuthHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class AuthHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _AuthHomePageState createState() => _AuthHomePageState();
}

class _AuthHomePageState extends State<AuthHomePage> {
  String? _userEmail;

  // Function to handle Google Sign-In
  Future<void> _signInWithGoogle() async {
    try {
      // Initiate Google Sign-In
      final user = await ServerpodAuthGoogleFlutter.signIn();
      setState(() {
        _userEmail = user?.email; // Store user email after sign-in
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle error
      print('Error signing in: $e');
    }
  }

  // Function to handle Sign-Out
  Future<void> _signOut() async {
    await ServerpodAuthGoogleFlutter.signOut();
    setState(() {
      _userEmail = null; // Clear user email on sign-out
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Google Auth Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: _userEmail == null
            ? Column(
                mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
                children: [
                  Text('You are not signed in.'),
                  SizedBox(height: 20),
                  ElevatedButton(
                    onPressed: _signInWithGoogle,
                    child: Text('Sign in with Google'),
                  ),
                ],
              )
            : Column(
                mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
                children: [
                  Text('Signed in as: $_userEmail'),
                  SizedBox(height: 20),
                  ElevatedButton(
                    onPressed: _signOut,
                    child: Text('Sign out'),
                  ),
                ],
              ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme, setting AuthHomePage as the home.
// 3. AuthHomePage maintains the user's email state and provides methods for signing in and out.
// 4. When the user taps the "Sign in with Google" button, _signInWithGoogle is called.
// 5. This method uses the ServerpodAuthGoogleFlutter package to initiate Google Sign-In.
// 6. Upon successful sign-in, the user's email is displayed, and the option to sign out is provided.
// 7. If the user taps "Sign out," the _signOut method is called, clearing the user's email and updating the UI.
```
