class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to hold the selected image
  String? _imagePath;

  // Function to pick an image
  Future<void> _pickImage() async {
    final pickedFile = await ChristianPickerImage.pickImage(source: ImageSource.gallery);
    if (pickedFile != null) {
      setState(() {
        _imagePath = pickedFile.path; // Update the state with the selected image path
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Image Picker Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the selected image if available
            _imagePath != null
                ? Image.file(File(_imagePath!))
                : Text('No image selected.'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _pickImage, // Call the image picking function
              child: Text('Pick Image'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),

# Complete Example of Christian Picker Image

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:christian_picker_image/christian_picker_image.dart';
import 'dart:io'; // Import for File handling

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to hold the selected image
  String? _imagePath;

  // Function to pick an image from the gallery
  Future<void> _pickImage() async {
    // Use the ChristianPickerImage to pick an image
    final pickedFile = await ChristianPickerImage.pickImage(source: ImageSource.gallery);
    if (pickedFile != null) {
      setState(() {
        _imagePath = pickedFile.path; // Update the state with the selected image path
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Image Picker Example')), // App bar title
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the selected image if available
            _imagePath != null
                ? Image.file(File(_imagePath!)) // Show the image
                : Text('No image selected.'), // Placeholder text
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between elements
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _pickImage, // Call the image picking function
              child: Text('Pick Image'), // Button text
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The main function to run the app
void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    home: RealFlutter(), // Set the home widget
  ));
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MaterialApp.
2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which is a StatefulWidget.
3. Inside the _RealFlutterState, a variable _imagePath is defined to hold the path of the selected image.
4. The _pickImage function is defined to handle image selection using the ChristianPickerImage package.
5. When the user taps the "Pick Image" button, the _pickImage function is called.
6. If an image is selected, the state is updated with the image path, and the image is displayed on the screen.
7. If no image is selected, a placeholder text is shown.
