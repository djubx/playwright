# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Solar Calculator Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **solar_calculator** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  solar_calculator: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if your application requires location services:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your location to calculate solar energy potential.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the **solar_calculator** package to calculate solar energy potential.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:solar_calculator/solar_calculator.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Solar Calculator',
      home: SolarCalculatorScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class SolarCalculatorScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SolarCalculatorScreenState createState() => _SolarCalculatorScreenState();
}

class _SolarCalculatorScreenState extends State<SolarCalculatorScreen> {
  double _solarEnergy = 0.0;

  void _calculateSolarEnergy() {
    // Example coordinates for New York City
    double latitude = 40.7128;
    double longitude = -74.0060;

    // Calculate solar energy potential
    _solarEnergy = SolarCalculator.calculateSolarEnergy(latitude, longitude);
    setState(() {});
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Solar Energy Calculator'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Estimated Solar Energy: $_solarEnergy kWh'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _calculateSolarEnergy,
              child: Text('Calculate Solar Energy'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Solar Calculator

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:solar_calculator/solar_calculator.dart';

// Main entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Main application widget
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Solar Calculator',
      home: SolarCalculatorScreen(),
    );
  }
}

// Screen widget for solar energy calculations
class SolarCalculatorScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SolarCalculatorScreenState createState() => _SolarCalculatorScreenState();
}

class _SolarCalculatorScreenState extends State<SolarCalculatorScreen> {
  double _solarEnergy = 0.0; // Variable to hold calculated solar energy

  // Method to calculate solar energy based on location
  void _calculateSolarEnergy() {
    // Example coordinates for New York City
    double latitude = 40.7128; // Latitude for NYC
    double longitude = -74.0060; // Longitude for NYC

    // Calculate solar energy potential using the solar_calculator package
    _solarEnergy = SolarCalculator.calculateSolarEnergy(latitude, longitude);
    setState(() {}); // Update the UI with the new solar energy value
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Solar Energy Calculator'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display the estimated solar energy
            Text('Estimated Solar Energy: $_solarEnergy kWh'),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Add space between elements
            // Button to trigger solar energy calculation
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _calculateSolarEnergy,
              child: Text('Calculate Solar Energy'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The SolarCalculatorScreen widget is created, which manages the state of the solar energy calculation.
// 4. When the user presses the "Calculate Solar Energy" button, the _calculateSolarEnergy method is called.
// 5. This method uses the SolarCalculator class to calculate the solar energy based on predefined coordinates (New York City).
// 6. The calculated solar energy value is stored in the _solarEnergy variable and the UI is updated to display this value.
```
