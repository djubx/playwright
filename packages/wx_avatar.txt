// This is the main entry point of the app.
// We create a MaterialApp with a title and a theme.
// The home property is set to MyHomePage, which is a stateful widget.

// In MyHomePage, we create a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// The body is a Center widget with a Column child.
// The Column contains two WxAvatar widgets: a basic one and a customized one.

// The basic avatar has a blue background and the text "Hello" inside.
// The customized avatar has a circular shape, a custom image background, an icon, and the text "Hello" inside.

// The SizedBox widget is used to add some space between the two avatars.

// This demo showcases the basic usage and customization options of the WxAvatar package.
