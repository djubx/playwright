# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Fan Side Drawer Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **fan_side_drawer** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  fan_side_drawer: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file, depending on your app's requirements. However, the **fan_side_drawer** package does not require any specific configurations beyond the standard Flutter setup.

## Step 3: Using the Package

To use the **fan_side_drawer** package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:fan_side_drawer/fan_side_drawer.dart';
```

You can then create a simple Flutter application that utilizes the fan side drawer. Below is a complete example demonstrating how to implement the fan side drawer in your app.

# Complete Example of Using the Fan Side Drawer

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fan_side_drawer/fan_side_drawer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Fan Side Drawer Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to control the drawer state
  bool _isDrawerOpen = false;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Fan Side Drawer Example'),
        // Button to toggle the drawer
        leading: IconButton(
          icon: Icon(Icons.menu),
          onPressed: () {
            setState(() {
              _isDrawerOpen = !_isDrawerOpen; // Toggle drawer state
            });
          },
        ),
      ),
      body: Stack(
        children: [
          // Main content of the app
          Center(
            child: Text(
              'Main Content Area',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
          ),
          // Fan side drawer
          FanSideDrawer(
            isOpen: _isDrawerOpen, // Control the drawer's open state
            onClose: () {
              setState(() {
                _isDrawerOpen = false; // Close the drawer
              });
            },
            items: [
              // List of items in the drawer
              DrawerItem(
                icon: Icons.home,
                title: 'Home',
                onTap: () {
                  // Handle Home tap
                  print('Home tapped');
                },
              ),
              DrawerItem(
                icon: Icons.settings,
                title: 'Settings',
                onTap: () {
                  // Handle Settings tap
                  print('Settings tapped');
                },
              ),
              DrawerItem(
                icon: Icons.info,
                title: 'About',
                onTap: () {
                  // Handle About tap
                  print('About tapped');
                },
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is the main screen containing the AppBar and body.
// 3. The AppBar has a menu button that toggles the state of the fan side drawer.
// 4. The body contains a Stack widget, which allows layering of the main content and the drawer.
// 5. The FanSideDrawer widget is used to create the drawer, which opens and closes based on the _isDrawerOpen variable.
// 6. The drawer contains a list of DrawerItem widgets, each representing a menu option.
// 7. Tapping on a menu item triggers the corresponding onTap function, which can be customized to navigate or perform actions.
```
