# Delta to PDF Flutter Package

The `delta_to_pdf` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to convert Delta documents (often used in rich text editors) into PDF format. This package is particularly useful for applications that require exporting formatted text, such as notes, reports, or any content created in a rich text editor. 

## When to Use This Package
You might consider using the `delta_to_pdf` package in scenarios such as:
- **Exporting User Content**: If your app allows users to create rich text content, you can provide an option to export this content as a PDF.
- **Generating Reports**: For applications that generate reports or documents based on user input, converting the content to PDF can enhance usability and sharing capabilities.
- **Creating Printable Documents**: If your application needs to create documents that users can print or share, converting to PDF is a standard approach.

## Features
- **Delta Document Support**: Directly converts Delta documents to PDF format.
- **Customizable Output**: Allows customization of the PDF output, including page size and margins.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

With these features, the `delta_to_pdf` package simplifies the process of generating PDF documents from rich text content, making it an essential tool for Flutter developers.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Delta to PDF Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the `delta_to_pdf` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  delta_to_pdf: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Installing the Package
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration
For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you plan to save the PDF to the device. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to save PDFs to your photo library.</string>
```

## Step 4: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to convert a Delta document to a PDF.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:delta_to_pdf/delta_to_pdf.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Delta to PDF Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Create a sample Delta document
              final delta = Delta()..insert('Hello, World!\n');
              
              // Convert Delta to PDF
              final pdfFile = await DeltaToPdf.convert(delta);
              
              // Save or share the PDF file
              // Implement your file handling logic here
            },
            child: Text('Convert to PDF'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with a button that converts a Delta document to a PDF when pressed.

# Complete Example of Delta to PDF

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:delta_to_pdf/delta_to_pdf.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Delta to PDF Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Step 1: Create a sample Delta document
              final delta = Delta()..insert('Hello, World!\n');

              // Step 2: Convert Delta to PDF
              final pdfFile = await DeltaToPdf.convert(delta);

              // Step 3: Save or share the PDF file
              // Implement your file handling logic here
              // For example, you can use the path_provider package to get the directory
              // and save the PDF file to the device.
            },
            child: Text('Convert to PDF'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The MaterialApp widget is created, providing a basic structure for the app.
// 3. A Scaffold widget is used to create the app's visual layout, including an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 5. When the button is pressed, a sample Delta document is created with the text "Hello, World!".
// 6. The Delta document is then converted to a PDF using the DeltaToPdf.convert method.
// 7. Finally, you can implement logic to save or share the generated PDF file, which is not included in this example but can be done using packages like path_provider or share.
