# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Inapp Flutter KYC Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `inapp_flutter_kyc` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `inapp_flutter_kyc` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  inapp_flutter_kyc: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

3. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request camera and photo library access:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera for KYC verification.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library for KYC verification.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the KYC process.

# Complete Example of Using Inapp Flutter KYC Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:inapp_flutter_kyc/inapp_flutter_kyc.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'KYC Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: KYCPage(),
    );
  }
}

class KYCPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _KYCPageState createState() => _KYCPageState();
}

class _KYCPageState extends State<KYCPage> {
  // This function will be called to start the KYC process
  void startKYC() async {
    try {
      // Initialize the KYC process
      final result = await InappFlutterKyc.startKYC();

      // Check the result of the KYC process
      if (result.isSuccess) {
        // Handle successful KYC verification
        ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
          SnackBar(content: Text('KYC Verification Successful!')),
        );
      } else {
        // Handle KYC failure
        ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
          SnackBar(content: Text('KYC Verification Failed: ${result.errorMessage}')),
        );
      }
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during the KYC process
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Error: $e')),
      );
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('KYC Verification'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: startKYC, // Start KYC process on button press
          child: Text('Start KYC'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and displays a button labeled "Start KYC".
// 2. When the button is pressed, the startKYC function is called.
// 3. The KYC process is initiated using InappFlutterKyc.startKYC().
// 4. If the KYC is successful, a success message is shown.
// 5. If the KYC fails, an error message is displayed.
// 6. Any exceptions during the KYC process are caught and displayed as error messages.
```
