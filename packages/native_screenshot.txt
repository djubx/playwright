# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Native Screenshot Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `native_screenshot` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  native_screenshot: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/native_screenshot).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request permission for saving images:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save screenshots.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save screenshots.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to capture a screenshot.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:native_screenshot/native_screenshot.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Native Screenshot Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Capture the screenshot
              final imagePath = await NativeScreenshot.takeScreenshot();
              // Display the path of the saved screenshot
              print('Screenshot saved at: $imagePath');
            },
            child: Text('Take Screenshot'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, a screenshot of the current screen is taken and saved to the device. The path of the saved screenshot is printed to the console.

# Complete Example of Using the Native Screenshot Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:native_screenshot/native_screenshot.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Native Screenshot Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Capture the screenshot
              final imagePath = await NativeScreenshot.takeScreenshot();
              // Display the path of the saved screenshot
              print('Screenshot saved at: $imagePath');
            },
            child: Text('Take Screenshot'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the onPressed callback is triggered.
// 5. The NativeScreenshot.takeScreenshot() method is called to capture the current screen.
// 6. The path of the saved screenshot is returned and printed to the console.
// 7. Users can find the screenshot in the specified path on their device.
```
