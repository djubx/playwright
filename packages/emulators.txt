# Flutter Package: emulators

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
## Description

The `emulators` Flutter package is designed to facilitate the creation and management of emulator instances for testing and development purposes. This package is particularly useful for developers who want to simulate various device environments without needing physical devices. It allows for the quick setup of emulators, making it easier to test applications across different screen sizes, operating systems, and hardware configurations.

### Key Features:
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Customizable Configurations**: Allows developers to specify various parameters for the emulator, such as device type, screen size, and OS version.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that integrates well with existing Flutter applications.
- **Real-Time Testing**: Enables developers to test their applications in real-time, providing immediate feedback on performance and UI behavior.

### When to Use:
- When you need to test your Flutter application on multiple devices without having physical access to them.
- For simulating different operating system versions and screen sizes to ensure compatibility.
- When developing applications that require specific hardware features, such as GPS or camera, and you want to test these features in a controlled environment.

## Tutorial

### Installation

To get started with the `emulators` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  emulators: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Platform-Specific Setup

#### Android
1. Ensure that you have the Android SDK installed and configured.
2. You may need to set up an Android Virtual Device (AVD) using Android Studio. This can be done by navigating to the AVD Manager and creating a new virtual device.

#### iOS
1. Make sure you have Xcode installed and configured.
2. You can create a simulator instance using Xcode's Simulator app. Open Xcode, go to the menu bar, and select `Xcode > Open Developer Tool > Simulator`.

### Basic Usage

Once the package is installed and your emulators are set up, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initialize and run an emulator:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:emulators/emulators.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Emulators Example',
      home: EmulatorHome(),
    );
  }
}

class EmulatorHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _EmulatorHomeState createState() => _EmulatorHomeState();
}

class _EmulatorHomeState extends State<EmulatorHome> {
  // Variable to hold the emulator instance
  Emulator? _emulator;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the emulator
    _initializeEmulator();
  }

  void _initializeEmulator() async {
    // Create a new emulator instance
    _emulator = await Emulators.createEmulator(
      device: 'Pixel_4', // Specify the device type
      osVersion: '11.0', // Specify the OS version
    );
    // Start the emulator
    await _emulator?.start();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Emulator Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Emulator is running!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:emulators/emulators.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Emulators Example',
      home: EmulatorHome(),
    );
  }
}

class EmulatorHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _EmulatorHomeState createState() => _EmulatorHomeState();
}

class _EmulatorHomeState extends State<EmulatorHome> {
  // Variable to hold the emulator instance
  Emulator? _emulator;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the emulator
    _initializeEmulator();
  }

  void _initializeEmulator() async {
    // Create a new emulator instance
    _emulator = await Emulators.createEmulator(
      device: 'Pixel_4', // Specify the device type
      osVersion: '11.0', // Specify the OS version
    );
    // Start the emulator
    await _emulator?.start();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Emulator Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Emulator is running!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The home of the MaterialApp is set to EmulatorHome, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 4. In the _EmulatorHomeState class, we initialize the emulator in the initState method.
// 5. The _initializeEmulator method creates a new emulator instance with specified device and OS version.
// 6. After creating the emulator, we start it.
// 7. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget displaying a message indicating that the emulator is running.
