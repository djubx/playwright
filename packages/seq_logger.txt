# seq_logger Flutter Package

The `seq_logger` package is a powerful logging tool for Flutter applications that allows developers to send structured log data to Seq, a popular log server. This package is particularly useful for applications that require robust logging capabilities, enabling developers to monitor application behavior, diagnose issues, and analyze performance in real-time.

## When to Use seq_logger
- **Debugging**: When you need to track down bugs or performance issues in your Flutter application.
- **Monitoring**: For applications in production where you want to keep an eye on logs and user interactions.
- **Structured Logging**: When you want to send logs in a structured format that can be easily queried and analyzed.

## Features
- **Structured Logging**: Send logs with structured data, making it easier to filter and search.
- **Asynchronous Logging**: Logs are sent asynchronously, ensuring that logging does not block the main thread.
- **Custom Log Levels**: Support for various log levels (e.g., Information, Warning, Error) to categorize logs effectively.
- **Integration with Seq**: Directly integrates with Seq, allowing for easy setup and configuration.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using seq_logger

## Installation
To add the `seq_logger` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  seq_logger: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/seq_logger).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following key to allow network requests:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `seq_logger` package, you need to initialize it with your Seq server URL. Hereâ€™s how you can do that:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:seq_logger/seq_logger.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the logger with your Seq server URL
  SeqLogger.init('http://your-seq-server:5341');
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Seq Logger Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Seq Logger Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Log an information message
              SeqLogger.info('Button pressed!');
            },
            child: Text('Press Me'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize the `SeqLogger` with the URL of the Seq server and log a message when the button is pressed.

# Complete Example of seq_logger in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:seq_logger/seq_logger.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the logger with your Seq server URL
  SeqLogger.init('http://your-seq-server:5341');
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Seq Logger Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Seq Logger Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Log an information message
              SeqLogger.info('Button pressed!');
            },
            child: Text('Press Me'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the SeqLogger with the URL of the Seq server.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 3. The MaterialApp widget is set up with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 4. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget with an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, an info log is sent to the Seq server with the message 'Button pressed!'.

### Summary
In this blog post, we explored the `seq_logger` Flutter package, which provides structured logging capabilities for Flutter applications. We covered the installation process, platform-specific configurations, and provided a complete example demonstrating how to use the package effectively. The application flow was explained step-by-step, highlighting how logs are sent to the Seq server when the button is pressed. This package is an excellent choice for developers looking to enhance their logging capabilities in Flutter applications.
