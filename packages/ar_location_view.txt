# Overview of the `ar_location_view` Flutter Package

The `ar_location_view` package is a powerful tool for integrating augmented reality (AR) features into Flutter applications, specifically focusing on location-based AR experiences. This package allows developers to create immersive applications that overlay digital content onto the real world, enhancing user interaction and engagement.

## When to Use `ar_location_view`

You should consider using the `ar_location_view` package in scenarios such as:

- **Tourism Applications**: Providing users with AR-guided tours, displaying historical information or points of interest in real-time.
- **Navigation Apps**: Enhancing navigation experiences by overlaying directions and information on the user's view of the real world.
- **Educational Tools**: Creating interactive learning experiences where users can visualize concepts in a real-world context.
- **Gaming**: Developing location-based games that utilize AR to create engaging gameplay experiences.

## Key Features

- **Location-Based AR**: Integrates GPS and AR to display content based on the user's location.
- **Customizable Overlays**: Allows developers to create and customize AR overlays, including 3D models and text.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup and usage within existing Flutter applications.

With these features, the `ar_location_view` package opens up a wide range of possibilities for developers looking to create innovative AR experiences in their applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `ar_location_view`

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `ar_location_view` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `ar_location_view` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ar_location_view: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/ar_location_view).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
```

2. **Enable AR Features**: Ensure that your app's `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 24 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 24
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request location and camera permissions:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show AR content.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera for AR features.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to implement the `ar_location_view` package.

# Complete Example of Using `ar_location_view`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ar_location_view/ar_location_view.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'AR Location View Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: ARLocationViewScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ARLocationViewScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ARLocationViewScreenState createState() => _ARLocationViewScreenState();
}

class _ARLocationViewScreenState extends State<ARLocationViewScreen> {
  // Initialize AR location view controller
  late ARLocationViewController arLocationViewController;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the AR location view controller
    arLocationViewController = ARLocationViewController();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('AR Location View'),
      ),
      body: ARLocationView(
        controller: arLocationViewController,
        onARViewCreated: _onARViewCreated,
      ),
    );
  }

  // Callback when AR view is created
  void _onARViewCreated(ARLocationViewController controller) {
    // Set the AR location view controller
    arLocationViewController = controller;

    // Add a marker at a specific location
    arLocationViewController.addMarker(
      latitude: 37.7749, // Example latitude
      longitude: -122.4194, // Example longitude
      title: 'San Francisco',
      description: 'This is San Francisco!',
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the AR location view controller
    arLocationViewController.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` widget.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home screen is set to `ARLocationViewScreen`, which is a stateful widget.
// 4. In the `initState` method, we initialize the `ARLocationViewController`.
// 5. The `build` method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and the ARLocationView widget.
// 6. The `onARViewCreated` callback is triggered when the AR view is created, allowing us to add markers.
// 7. We add a marker at the specified latitude and longitude with a title and description.
// 8. Finally, we dispose of the AR location view controller when the widget is removed from the widget tree.
```
