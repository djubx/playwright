# Complete Example of Circular Bottom Navigation

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:circular_bottom_navigation/circular_bottom_navigation.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Circular Bottom Navigation Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  // Initialize the current index for the selected item
  int _currentIndex = 0;

  // List of pages to navigate to
  final List<Widget> _pages = [
    Center(child: Text('Home Page')),
    Center(child: Text('Search Page')),
    Center(child: Text('Profile Page')),
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Circular Bottom Navigation'),
      ),
      body: _pages[_currentIndex], // Display the current page based on the index
      bottomNavigationBar: CircularBottomNavigation(
        // Define the items for the circular navigation
        items: <CircularBottomNavigationItem>[
          CircularBottomNavigationItem(
            icon: Icons.home,
            title: 'Home',
            activeColor: Colors.blue,
            inactiveColor: Colors.grey,
          ),
          CircularBottomNavigationItem(
            icon: Icons.search,
            title: 'Search',
            activeColor: Colors.blue,
            inactiveColor: Colors.grey,
          ),
          CircularBottomNavigationItem(
            icon: Icons.person,
            title: 'Profile',
            activeColor: Colors.blue,
            inactiveColor: Colors.grey,
          ),
        ],
        // Set the current index
        currentIndex: _currentIndex,
        // Callback when an item is tapped
        onTap: (index) {
          setState(() {
            _currentIndex = index; // Update the current index
          });
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home screen.
// 3. HomeScreen is a StatefulWidget that maintains the current index of the selected navigation item.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold displays the current page based on the selected index from the _pages list.
// 5. The CircularBottomNavigation widget is used to create the circular navigation bar.
// 6. Each item in the navigation bar is defined with an icon, title, and colors for active/inactive states.
// 7. When an item is tapped, the onTap callback updates the current index, causing the body to display the corresponding page.
```
