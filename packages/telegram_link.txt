# Tutorial: Setting Up the Telegram Link Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `telegram_link` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  telegram_link: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/telegram_link).

## Step 2: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:telegram_link/telegram_link.dart';
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `Info.plist` file to allow opening external links:

```xml
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
    <string>tg</string>
</array>
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the package to create Telegram links. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a link to a Telegram user:

```dart
void openTelegramUser(String username) {
  final telegramLink = TelegramLink(username: username);
  telegramLink.launch();
}
```

This function will open the Telegram app and direct the user to the specified username.

## Step 5: Testing

Run your application on an emulator or a physical device to test the functionality. Ensure that the Telegram app is installed on the device to see the link in action.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the `telegram_link` package into your Flutter application successfully.

# Complete Example of Using the Telegram Link Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:telegram_link/telegram_link.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Telegram Link Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Telegram Link Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Call the function to open Telegram with a specific username
              openTelegramUser('your_username'); // Replace with your Telegram username
            },
            child: Text('Open Telegram User'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to open a Telegram user link
  void openTelegramUser(String username) {
    // Create a TelegramLink instance with the provided username
    final telegramLink = TelegramLink(username: username);
    // Launch the Telegram app with the link
    telegramLink.launch();
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title "Telegram Link Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget with an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the openTelegramUser function is called with a specified username.
// 6. The openTelegramUser function creates a TelegramLink instance and launches it, opening the Telegram app with the specified user.
```

// The application flow is straightforward: it initializes a Flutter app with a button that, when pressed, opens the Telegram app to a specific user. The user can replace 'your_username' with their actual Telegram username to test the functionality. The app demonstrates how to integrate the `telegram_link` package effectively, providing a seamless user experience for Telegram interactions.
