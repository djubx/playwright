# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_app_icons

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_app_icons` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_app_icons` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_app_icons: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Configuring the Package

### Android Configuration

1. Navigate to your Android project directory: `android/app/src/main/`.
2. Open the `AndroidManifest.xml` file and ensure that the following permissions are included:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

3. Ensure that your app's `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your iOS project in Xcode by navigating to `ios/Runner.xcworkspace`.
2. In the `Info.plist` file, ensure that you have the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to set custom app icons.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have configured the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Hereâ€™s how to implement it:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_app_icons/flutter_app_icons.dart';
```

2. Use the `AppIcon` class to set your custom app icon. You can specify the path to your icon image and the desired icon sizes.

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter App Icons Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter App Icons Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Set the app icon
              FlutterAppIcons.setAppIcon('assets/icon.png');
            },
            child: Text('Set App Icon'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Make sure to replace `'assets/icon.png'` with the path to your custom icon image.

## Step 4: Running the App

After completing the above steps, you can run your app on an emulator or a physical device. When you press the "Set App Icon" button, the app icon will be updated to your custom icon.

# Complete Example of flutter_app_icons

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_app_icons/flutter_app_icons.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter App Icons Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter App Icons Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Set the app icon using the FlutterAppIcons package
              FlutterAppIcons.setAppIcon('assets/icon.png');
            },
            child: Text('Set App Icon'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Flutter App Icons Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold has a Center widget that centers its child.
// 5. The child is an ElevatedButton that, when pressed, calls the setAppIcon method from the FlutterAppIcons package.
// 6. The setAppIcon method takes the path to the custom icon image ('assets/icon.png') and updates the app icon accordingly.
```

// Final Summary:
// The application starts by initializing the RealFlutter widget, which sets up the MaterialApp and its UI components. The user can press the button to change the app icon to a custom image specified in the assets folder. This demonstrates the core functionality of the `flutter_app_icons` package, allowing for easy customization of app icons in Flutter applications.
