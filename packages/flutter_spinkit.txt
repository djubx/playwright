# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `flutter_spinkit`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use `flutter_spinkit`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_spinkit: ^5.1.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` in your terminal to install the package.

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the `flutter_spinkit` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_spinkit/flutter_spinkit.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Loading Indicators

You can use the loading indicators in your widget tree. Here’s how to implement a simple loading spinner:

### Example for Android and iOS

The implementation is the same for both Android and iOS. Here’s a basic example:

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(
      title: Text('Flutter SpinKit Example'),
    ),
    body: Center(
      child: SpinKitCircle(
        color: Colors.blue,
        size: 50.0,
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

### Platform-Specific Details

- **Android**: Ensure that your Android project is set up with the latest Flutter SDK. The `flutter_spinkit` package does not require any additional configuration for Android.
- **iOS**: Similarly, for iOS, ensure that your project is using the latest version of Flutter. No additional configurations are needed.

## Step 4: Customizing the Spinner

You can customize the spinner by changing its color, size, and animation type. Here’s an example of a customized spinner:

```dart
SpinKitFadingCircle(
  color: Colors.red,
  size: 70.0,
);
```

This will create a fading circle spinner with a red color and a size of 70.0.

With these steps, you can easily integrate and customize loading indicators in your Flutter application using the `flutter_spinkit` package.

# Complete Example: Flutter Application Using `flutter_spinkit`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_spinkit/flutter_spinkit.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter SpinKit Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: LoadingScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class LoadingScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Loading Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        // Displaying a loading spinner while data is being fetched
        child: SpinKitFadingCircle(
          color: Colors.blue,
          size: 100.0,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to LoadingScreen, which is another StatelessWidget.
// 4. In LoadingScreen, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. The Center widget contains a SpinKitFadingCircle spinner, which is displayed while the app is loading.
// 6. The spinner is blue and has a size of 100.0, providing a visual indication that the app is processing data.
