Here's a detailed technical blog on the "desktop_window" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Desktop Window Flutter Package

The `desktop_window` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to enhance the desktop experience of Flutter applications. It allows developers to manipulate the window properties of their applications, such as resizing, minimizing, maximizing, and setting window positions. This package is particularly useful for applications that require a more native desktop feel, enabling features that are typically available in desktop applications but not in mobile apps.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `desktop_window` package when:
- You are developing a Flutter application that targets desktop platforms (Windows, macOS, and Linux).
- You need to customize the window behavior, such as setting a fixed size or allowing the user to resize the window.
- You want to create a more immersive user experience by controlling the window's appearance and behavior.

## Key Features
- **Window Resizing**: Control whether the window can be resized by the user.
- **Window Positioning**: Set the initial position of the window on the screen.
- **Minimize/Maximize**: Programmatically minimize or maximize the window.
- **Full-Screen Mode**: Enable full-screen mode for a more immersive experience.
- **Custom Window Frame**: Create a custom window frame for a unique look and feel.

With these features, the `desktop_window` package provides a robust solution for developers looking to enhance their Flutter desktop applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Desktop Window Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `desktop_window` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  desktop_window: ^0.3.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### For Windows
1. Ensure you have the necessary Windows SDK installed.
2. In your `windows/runner/runner.cpp`, include the `desktop_window` header:
   ```cpp
   #include <desktop_window/desktop_window.h>
   ```

3. Initialize the desktop window in the `main` function:
   ```cpp
   DesktopWindow::SetWindowSize(800, 600);
   ```

### For macOS
1. Open your `macos/Runner/AppDelegate.swift`.
2. Import the `desktop_window` package:
   ```swift
   import desktop_window
   ```

3. Set the window size in the `applicationDidFinishLaunching` method:
   ```swift
   DesktopWindow.setWindowSize(width: 800, height: 600)
   ```

### For Linux
1. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed.
2. In your `linux/main.cc`, include the `desktop_window` header:
   ```cpp
   #include <desktop_window/desktop_window.h>
   ```

3. Set the window size in the `main` function:
   ```cpp
   DesktopWindow::SetWindowSize(800, 600);
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package in Your Flutter App

Once you have added the package and configured it for your platform, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the `desktop_window` package to control the window properties.

<!-- END_TUTORIAL -->

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:desktop_window/desktop_window.dart';

void main() async {
  // Ensure that the window size is set before running the app
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await DesktopWindow.setWindowSize(Size(800, 600)); // Set initial window size
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Desktop Window Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Desktop Window Example'),
          actions: [
            IconButton(
              icon: Icon(Icons.minimize),
              onPressed: () {
                // Minimize the window
                DesktopWindow.minimize();
              },
            ),
            IconButton(
              icon: Icon(Icons.fullscreen),
              onPressed: () {
                // Maximize the window
                DesktopWindow.maximize();
              },
            ),
            IconButton(
              icon: Icon(Icons.close),
              onPressed: () {
                // Close the application
                DesktopWindow.close();
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text('Welcome to the Desktop Window Example!'),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () async {
                  // Set the window to a fixed size
                  await DesktopWindow.setWindowSize(Size(800, 600));
                  await DesktopWindow.setWindowMinSize(Size(800, 600));
                },
                child: Text('Set Fixed Size'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter binding and sets the initial window size to 800x600 pixels.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is the main widget of the application, which builds the UI.
// 3. The AppBar contains buttons to minimize, maximize, and close the window.
// 4. The body of the application displays a welcome message and a button to set a fixed window size.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the window size is set to 800x600 pixels, and the minimum size is also set to prevent resizing below this size.
