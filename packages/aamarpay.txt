# Tutorial: Setting Up Aamarpay in Your Flutter Application

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the Aamarpay Flutter package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the Aamarpay package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  aamarpay: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/aamarpay).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the correct minSdkVersion. It should be at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. **CocoaPods**: Ensure you have the latest version of CocoaPods installed. Run the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   pod install
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Aamarpay Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your Flutter application.

1. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the Aamarpay package:

   ```dart
   import 'package:aamarpay/aamarpay.dart';
   ```

2. **Initialize the Payment**: You can initialize the payment process by creating an instance of the `RealFlutter` class and calling the appropriate methods to handle payments.

3. **Handle Payment Response**: Implement the logic to handle the payment response and update the UI accordingly.

By following these steps, you can successfully integrate the Aamarpay package into your Flutter application and start processing payments.

# Complete Example: Aamarpay Integration in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:aamarpay/aamarpay.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Aamarpay Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: PaymentScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PaymentScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PaymentScreenState createState() => _PaymentScreenState();
}

class _PaymentScreenState extends State<PaymentScreen> {
  // Function to initiate payment
  void initiatePayment() {
    // Create a payment request
    Aamarpay.startPayment(
      amount: '100', // Amount to be paid
      orderId: 'order123', // Unique order ID
      currency: 'BDT', // Currency code
      successUrl: 'https://your-success-url.com', // URL to redirect on success
      failUrl: 'https://your-fail-url.com', // URL to redirect on failure
      onSuccess: (response) {
        // Handle successful payment response
        print('Payment Successful: $response');
        ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
          SnackBar(content: Text('Payment Successful!')),
        );
      },
      onFailure: (error) {
        // Handle payment failure response
        print('Payment Failed: $error');
        ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
          SnackBar(content: Text('Payment Failed!')),
        );
      },
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Aamarpay Payment'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: initiatePayment, // Call initiatePayment on button press
          child: Text('Pay Now'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The home screen is set to PaymentScreen, where the payment process will be initiated.
// 3. When the "Pay Now" button is pressed, the initiatePayment function is called.
// 4. The initiatePayment function creates a payment request using Aamarpay.startPayment.
// 5. The payment request includes the amount, order ID, currency, and success/failure URLs.
// 6. On successful payment, the onSuccess callback is triggered, displaying a success message.
// 7. On payment failure, the onFailure callback is triggered, displaying a failure message.
