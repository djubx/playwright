# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the App Launcher Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the app_launcher package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  app_launcher: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/app_launcher).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following entry to allow your app to open URLs:

```xml
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
    <string>http</string>
    <string>https</string>
    <string>your_custom_scheme</string> <!-- Add any custom schemes you plan to use -->
</array>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to launch an external application.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:app_launcher/app_launcher.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('App Launcher Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Launching a URL
              const url = 'https://www.google.com';
              if (await AppLauncher.canLaunch(url)) {
                await AppLauncher.launch(url);
              } else {
                // Handle the error
                print('Could not launch $url');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Open Google'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, it checks if the URL can be launched and then opens it in the default web browser.

# Complete Example of Using the App Launcher Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:app_launcher/app_launcher.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('App Launcher Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Define the URL to launch
              const url = 'https://www.google.com';
              
              // Check if the URL can be launched
              if (await AppLauncher.canLaunch(url)) {
                // Launch the URL
                await AppLauncher.launch(url);
              } else {
                // Handle the error if the URL cannot be launched
                print('Could not launch $url');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Open Google'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The MaterialApp widget is created, providing the app structure.
// 3. A Scaffold widget is used to create the basic visual layout with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the onPressed callback is triggered.
// 6. The app checks if the specified URL can be launched using AppLauncher.canLaunch().
// 7. If the URL can be launched, it is opened using AppLauncher.launch().
// 8. If the URL cannot be launched, an error message is printed to the console.
