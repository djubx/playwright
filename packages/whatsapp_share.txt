# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the WhatsApp Share Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `whatsapp_share` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  whatsapp_share: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/whatsapp_share).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following entries to allow sharing:

```xml
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
    <string>whatsapp</string>
</array>
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:whatsapp_share/whatsapp_share.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the package to share content. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to share a text message:

```dart
WhatsAppShare.share(
  phone: '1234567890', // Optional: phone number without '+' sign
  text: 'Hello from my Flutter app!',
);
```

This will open WhatsApp with the specified text ready to be sent.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that WhatsApp is installed on the device for the sharing functionality to work.
- Test the sharing feature on both Android and iOS devices to ensure compatibility.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the `whatsapp_share` package into your Flutter application successfully.

# Complete Example of WhatsApp Share in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:whatsapp_share/whatsapp_share.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'WhatsApp Share Example',
      home: SharePage(),
    );
  }
}

class SharePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('WhatsApp Share Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Trigger the WhatsApp share functionality
            WhatsAppShare.share(
              phone: '1234567890', // Optional: phone number without '+' sign
              text: 'Hello from my Flutter app!',
            );
          },
          child: Text('Share on WhatsApp'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home page.
// 3. The SharePage widget is displayed as the home page, containing an AppBar and a centered button.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the WhatsAppShare.share method is called, which opens WhatsApp with the specified text.
// 5. The user can then choose a contact and send the message directly from WhatsApp.
