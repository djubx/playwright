    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Using the Package
To use the `rating_and_feedback_collector`, you can create a simple feedback form in your app. Hereâ€™s how to implement it:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:rating_and_feedback_collector/rating_and_feedback_collector.dart';
```

2. Initialize the feedback collector in your main widget:

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: FeedbackScreen(),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Create a feedback screen that utilizes the package:

```dart
class FeedbackScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Feedback')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Show the feedback collector
            showDialog(
              context: context,
              builder: (context) => RatingAndFeedbackCollector(
                title: 'Rate Us',
                message: 'Please rate your experience',
                onSubmit: (rating, feedback) {
                  // Handle the submitted rating and feedback
                  print('Rating: $rating, Feedback: $feedback');
                },
              ),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Give Feedback'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This setup will allow users to provide feedback when they press the "Give Feedback" button.

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: FeedbackScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class FeedbackScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Feedback')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Show the feedback collector dialog when the button is pressed
            showDialog(
              context: context,
              builder: (context) => RatingAndFeedbackCollector(
                title: 'Rate Us', // Title of the feedback dialog
                message: 'Please rate your experience', // Message prompting for feedback
                onSubmit: (rating, feedback) {
                  // Handle the submitted rating and feedback
                  print('Rating: $rating, Feedback: $feedback');
                  // You can also send this data to your server or analytics tool
                },
              ),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Give Feedback'), // Button text
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The FeedbackScreen widget is displayed as the home screen.
// 3. When the user taps the "Give Feedback" button, a dialog is shown.
// 4. The dialog contains the RatingAndFeedbackCollector, prompting the user to rate and provide feedback.
// 5. Upon submission, the rating and feedback are printed to the console, and you can handle them as needed.
