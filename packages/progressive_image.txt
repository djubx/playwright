# Progressive Image Flutter Package

The `progressive_image` Flutter package is designed to enhance the user experience by loading images progressively. This means that instead of waiting for a high-resolution image to load completely, users can see a lower-resolution version first, which improves perceived performance and provides a smoother experience, especially on slower networks.

## When to Use

You should consider using the `progressive_image` package in scenarios such as:
- **Image-heavy applications**: Apps that display a lot of images, like galleries or social media platforms, can benefit from progressive loading.
- **Slow network conditions**: In areas with poor connectivity, showing a low-resolution image first can keep users engaged while the high-resolution image loads.
- **User experience enhancement**: Any application where user experience is a priority can leverage this package to provide a more responsive interface.

## Features

- **Progressive Loading**: Load images in stages, starting with a low-resolution version and progressively enhancing to a high-resolution version.
- **Caching**: Efficiently caches images to reduce loading times on subsequent views.
- **Customizable**: Allows customization of the loading indicators and error handling.

Overall, the `progressive_image` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to improve image loading performance and user experience.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Progressive Image Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `progressive_image` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  progressive_image: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install Packages

Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to add permissions for network access in your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the `ProgressiveImage` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:progressive_image/progressive_image.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Progressive Image Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ProgressiveImage(
            placeholder: AssetImage('assets/placeholder.png'), // Low-res placeholder
            thumbnail: NetworkImage('https://example.com/thumbnail.jpg'), // Low-res image
            image: NetworkImage('https://example.com/highres.jpg'), // High-res image
            height: 300.0,
            width: 300.0,
            fit: BoxFit.cover,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a simple Flutter application that displays a progressive image. The `ProgressiveImage` widget takes three parameters: a placeholder image, a thumbnail image, and the final high-resolution image.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we covered how to set up the `progressive_image` package in your Flutter project, including platform-specific configurations for Android and iOS. We also demonstrated how to use the `ProgressiveImage` widget to load images progressively, enhancing the user experience.

# Complete Example of Progressive Image in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:progressive_image/progressive_image.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Progressive Image Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ProgressiveImage(
            // Placeholder image shown while loading
            placeholder: AssetImage('assets/placeholder.png'), // Low-res placeholder
            // Thumbnail image that loads first
            thumbnail: NetworkImage('https://example.com/thumbnail.jpg'), // Low-res image
            // High-resolution image that loads last
            image: NetworkImage('https://example.com/highres.jpg'), // High-res image
            height: 300.0, // Set height of the image
            width: 300.0, // Set width of the image
            fit: BoxFit.cover, // Fit the image within the specified dimensions
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The AppBar displays the title "Progressive Image Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 5. The ProgressiveImage widget is used to load images progressively:
//    - The placeholder image is displayed while the thumbnail and high-res images are loading.
//    - The thumbnail image is loaded first, providing a quick visual feedback.
//    - Once the thumbnail is loaded, the high-resolution image is fetched and displayed.
// 6. The image dimensions are set to 300x300 pixels, and the BoxFit.cover ensures the image covers the entire area without distortion.
