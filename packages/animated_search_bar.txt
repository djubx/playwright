# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Animated Search Bar

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `animated_search_bar` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  animated_search_bar: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/animated_search_bar).

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Animated Search Bar

Now that you have set up the package, you can use the `AnimatedSearchBar` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_search_bar/animated_search_bar.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String searchText = '';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Animated Search Bar Example'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          AnimatedSearchBar(
            onChanged: (value) {
              setState(() {
                searchText = value; // Update the search text
              });
            },
            onSubmitted: (value) {
              // Handle search submission
              print('Search submitted: $value');
            },
          ),
          // Display search results or other content based on searchText
          Expanded(
            child: ListView.builder(
              itemCount: 100, // Example item count
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text('Item $index'),
                );
              },
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with an animated search bar. The search bar updates the `searchText` state variable whenever the user types in it. You can further enhance this by filtering the displayed list based on the `searchText`.

# Complete Example of Animated Search Bar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_search_bar/animated_search_bar.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String searchText = ''; // Variable to hold the search text

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Animated Search Bar Example'), // App title
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          AnimatedSearchBar(
            onChanged: (value) {
              setState(() {
                searchText = value; // Update the search text
              });
            },
            onSubmitted: (value) {
              // Handle search submission
              print('Search submitted: $value');
            },
          ),
          // Display search results or other content based on searchText
          Expanded(
            child: ListView.builder(
              itemCount: 100, // Example item count
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text('Item $index'), // Display item
                );
              },
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 2. The _RealFlutterState class manages the state of the search text.
// 3. The Scaffold widget provides the basic structure of the app, including the AppBar and body.
// 4. The AnimatedSearchBar widget is used to create a search bar with animation.
// 5. The onChanged callback updates the searchText variable whenever the user types in the search bar.
// 6. The onSubmitted callback can be used to handle search submissions, such as making API calls or filtering data.
// 7. The ListView.builder displays a list of items, which can be filtered based on the searchText variable.
