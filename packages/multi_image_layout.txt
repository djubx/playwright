# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Multi Image Layout

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `multi_image_layout` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  multi_image_layout: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:multi_image_layout/multi_image_layout.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package

You can now use the `MultiImageLayout` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
MultiImageLayout(
  images: [
    'https://example.com/image1.jpg',
    'https://example.com/image2.jpg',
    'https://example.com/image3.jpg',
  ],
  layoutType: LayoutType.grid, // Choose between grid, list, etc.
  crossAxisCount: 3, // Number of columns in grid layout
)
```

This will create a grid layout displaying the specified images. You can customize the layout type and other parameters as needed.

# Complete Example of Multi Image Layout

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:multi_image_layout/multi_image_layout.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Multi Image Layout Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Multi Image Layout'),
        ),
        body: MultiImageLayout(
          images: [
            'https://example.com/image1.jpg',
            'https://example.com/image2.jpg',
            'https://example.com/image3.jpg',
            'https://example.com/image4.jpg',
            'https://example.com/image5.jpg',
            'https://example.com/image6.jpg',
          ],
          layoutType: LayoutType.grid, // Set the layout type to grid
          crossAxisCount: 3, // Number of columns in the grid
          imageFit: BoxFit.cover, // Fit the images to cover the space
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the Flutter application by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body uses the MultiImageLayout widget to display a grid of images.
// 5. The images are fetched from the provided URLs and displayed in a grid layout with 3 columns.
// 6. The BoxFit.cover property ensures that the images cover the allocated space without distortion.
```
