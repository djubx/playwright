# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Swiping Card Deck Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the **swiping_card_deck** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  swiping_card_deck: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the swiping card deck.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:swiping_card_deck/swiping_card_deck.dart';
```

2. Create a StatefulWidget to manage the card deck state.

3. Use the `SwipingCardDeck` widget to display your cards.

### Example Code Snippet
Hereâ€™s a basic implementation:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  final List<String> items = ["Card 1", "Card 2", "Card 3"]; // Sample data

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Swiping Card Deck Example")),
      body: SwipingCardDeck(
        items: items,
        onSwipe: (item) {
          // Handle swipe action
          print("Swiped: $item");
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic swiping card deck with three cards. The `onSwipe` callback allows you to handle swipe actions.

## Conclusion
You have now set up the **swiping_card_deck** package in your Flutter application. You can customize the card appearance and behavior further based on your app's requirements.

# Complete Example of Swiping Card Deck

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:swiping_card_deck/swiping_card_deck.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Swiping Card Deck Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Sample data for the card deck
  final List<String> items = ["Card 1", "Card 2", "Card 3", "Card 4", "Card 5"];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Swiping Card Deck Example")),
      body: SwipingCardDeck(
        items: items,
        onSwipe: (item) {
          // Handle swipe action
          print("Swiped: $item"); // Log the swiped item
        },
        cardBuilder: (context, item) {
          // Build each card
          return Card(
            elevation: 4,
            child: Center(
              child: Text(
                item,
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
            ),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets the home widget to RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that manages the state of the card deck.
// 3. The items list contains the data to be displayed on the cards.
// 4. The SwipingCardDeck widget is used to create the card deck interface.
// 5. The onSwipe callback is triggered when a card is swiped, logging the swiped item.
// 6. The cardBuilder function defines how each card is built, allowing for customization.
