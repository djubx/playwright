# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Animated Reorderable List

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `animated_reorderable_list` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  animated_reorderable_list: ^0.3.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that you have the package installed, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement an animated reorderable list.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:animated_reorderable_list/animated_reorderable_list.dart';
```

2. Create a stateful widget to manage the list:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  List<String> items = ["Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3", "Item 4"];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Animated Reorderable List")),
      body: AnimatedReorderableList(
        items: items,
        onReorder: (oldIndex, newIndex) {
          setState(() {
            if (newIndex > oldIndex) newIndex--;
            final item = items.removeAt(oldIndex);
            items.insert(newIndex, item);
          });
        },
        itemBuilder: (context, item, index) {
          return ListTile(
            key: ValueKey(item),
            title: Text(item),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic reorderable list where users can drag and drop items to rearrange them.

# Complete Example of Animated Reorderable List

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_reorderable_list/animated_reorderable_list.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // List of items to display in the reorderable list
  List<String> items = ["Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3", "Item 4"];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Animated Reorderable List")),
      body: AnimatedReorderableList(
        // The items to be displayed
        items: items,
        // Callback function to handle reordering
        onReorder: (oldIndex, newIndex) {
          setState(() {
            // Adjust newIndex if the item is moved down
            if (newIndex > oldIndex) newIndex--;
            // Remove the item from the old position and insert it at the new position
            final item = items.removeAt(oldIndex);
            items.insert(newIndex, item);
          });
        },
        // Builder function to create each item in the list
        itemBuilder: (context, item, index) {
          return ListTile(
            key: ValueKey(item), // Unique key for each item
            title: Text(item), // Display the item text
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 2. The _RealFlutterState class manages the state of the reorderable list.
// 3. A list of items is defined, which will be displayed in the AnimatedReorderableList.
// 4. The AnimatedReorderableList widget is built with the items list and an onReorder callback.
// 5. When an item is dragged and dropped, the onReorder callback is triggered, updating the items list.
// 6. The UI is rebuilt with the new order of items, and the animations are handled by the package.
```
