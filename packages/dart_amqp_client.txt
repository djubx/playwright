# Overview of the dart_amqp_client Package

The `dart_amqp_client` package is a Dart client for interacting with RabbitMQ, a popular message broker that facilitates communication between different parts of an application. This package is particularly useful for Flutter developers who need to implement message queuing, publish/subscribe patterns, or any asynchronous communication in their applications.

## When to Use This Package
- **Microservices Architecture**: When building applications that follow a microservices architecture, where different services need to communicate asynchronously.
- **Real-time Applications**: For applications that require real-time data updates, such as chat applications or live notifications.
- **Decoupled Systems**: When you want to decouple different parts of your application to improve scalability and maintainability.

## Key Features
- **Connection Management**: Handles connections to RabbitMQ servers, including automatic reconnection.
- **Message Publishing**: Allows for easy publishing of messages to queues.
- **Message Consumption**: Supports consuming messages from queues with callback functions.
- **Exchange Types**: Supports various exchange types (direct, topic, fanout, etc.) for flexible message routing.
- **Error Handling**: Provides mechanisms for handling errors and connection issues gracefully.

Overall, `dart_amqp_client` is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to implement robust messaging solutions in their applications.

# Setting Up and Using dart_amqp_client

## Installation
To use the `dart_amqp_client` package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  dart_amqp_client: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/dart_amqp_client).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21.
2. Add the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` if you plan to use network features.

### iOS
1. Ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` for network access.
2. You may need to enable App Transport Security (ATS) if you are connecting to a non-secure RabbitMQ server.

## Basic Usage
Hereâ€™s how to set up a simple connection to a RabbitMQ server and publish/consume messages.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:dart_amqp_client/dart_amqp_client.dart';
```

2. Create a connection and channel:

```dart
final client = RealFlutter();
client.connect('amqp://user:password@localhost:5672');
```

3. Publish a message:

```dart
client.publish('my_queue', 'Hello, RabbitMQ!');
```

4. Consume messages:

```dart
client.consume('my_queue', (message) {
  print('Received: ${message.payloadAsString}');
});
```

This setup allows you to connect to a RabbitMQ server, publish messages to a queue, and consume messages from that queue.

# Complete Example of Using dart_amqp_client

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dart_amqp_client/dart_amqp_client.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'RabbitMQ Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late Client client; // Declare the RabbitMQ client
  late Channel channel; // Declare the channel for communication
  final String queueName = 'my_queue'; // Define the queue name

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _setupRabbitMQ(); // Set up RabbitMQ connection on initialization
  }

  // Function to set up RabbitMQ connection
  void _setupRabbitMQ() async {
    client = Client(); // Initialize the client
    await client.connect('amqp://user:password@localhost:5672'); // Connect to RabbitMQ
    channel = await client.channel(); // Create a channel

    // Declare a queue
    await channel.queue(queueName).declare();

    // Publish a message
    channel.queue(queueName).publish('Hello, RabbitMQ!'); // Send a message to the queue

    // Consume messages
    channel.queue(queueName).consume((message) {
      print('Received: ${message.payloadAsString}'); // Print received message
      message.ack(); // Acknowledge the message
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    channel.close(); // Close the channel
    client.close(); // Close the client
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('RabbitMQ Client Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Check your console for messages!'), // Inform user to check console
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts and initializes the MyApp widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter state, the _setupRabbitMQ function is called during initState.
// 3. A connection to RabbitMQ is established, and a channel is created.
// 4. A queue named 'my_queue' is declared.
// 5. A message "Hello, RabbitMQ!" is published to the queue.
// 6. The application listens for messages from the queue and prints them to the console.
// 7. When a message is received, it is acknowledged to remove it from the queue.
// 8. The channel and client are closed when the widget is disposed.
