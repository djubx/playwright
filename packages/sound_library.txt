# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Sound Library Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the **sound_library** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  sound_library: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access audio files. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located in `android/app/src/main/` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration
For iOS, you need to add the following key to your `Info.plist` file located in `ios/Runner/` to allow audio playback:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio playback.</string>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to play a sound:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sound_library/sound_library.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Sound Library Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              SoundLibrary.play('assets/sound.mp3'); // Play sound
            },
            child: Text('Play Sound'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, the sound file located at `assets/sound.mp3` will play.

## Step 4: Advanced Features
You can also control playback with methods like `pause()`, `stop()`, and adjust the volume using `setVolume(double volume)`.

```dart
SoundLibrary.pause(); // Pause the currently playing sound
SoundLibrary.stop(); // Stop the currently playing sound
SoundLibrary.setVolume(0.5); // Set volume to 50%
```

With these steps, you can effectively integrate the **sound_library** package into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using the Sound Library Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sound_library/sound_library.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Initialize the sound library
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    SoundLibrary.initialize(); // Initialize the sound library
  }

  // Function to play sound
  void playSound() {
    SoundLibrary.play('assets/sound.mp3'); // Play the sound file
  }

  // Function to pause sound
  void pauseSound() {
    SoundLibrary.pause(); // Pause the currently playing sound
  }

  // Function to stop sound
  void stopSound() {
    SoundLibrary.stop(); // Stop the currently playing sound
  }

  // Function to set volume
  void setVolume(double volume) {
    SoundLibrary.setVolume(volume); // Set the volume level
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Sound Library Example')),
        body: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: playSound, // Play sound on button press
              child: Text('Play Sound'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: pauseSound, // Pause sound on button press
              child: Text('Pause Sound'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: stopSound, // Stop sound on button press
              child: Text('Stop Sound'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () => setVolume(0.5), // Set volume to 50%
              child: Text('Set Volume to 50%'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which initializes the sound library.
// 2. The UI consists of four buttons: Play, Pause, Stop, and Set Volume.
// 3. When the "Play Sound" button is pressed, the sound file located at 'assets/sound.mp3' is played.
// 4. The "Pause Sound" button pauses the currently playing sound.
// 5. The "Stop Sound" button stops the sound playback completely.
// 6. The "Set Volume to 50%" button adjusts the volume of the sound playback to 50%.
// 7. The app provides a simple interface to demonstrate the functionalities of the sound_library package.
