# Flutter Line LIFF Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_line_liff` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_line_liff` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_line_liff: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_line_liff).

## Step 2: Configuring for Android

For Android, you need to ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file is configured correctly. Add the following permissions and metadata:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.yourapp">

    <application
        android:label="Your App"
        android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher">
        
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.linecorp.lineapp.LIFF_ID"
            android:value="YOUR_LIFF_ID" />
        
        <activity
            android:name=".MainActivity"
            android:launchMode="singleTask">
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
                <data android:scheme="yourapp" android:host="liff" />
            </intent-filter>
        </activity>
    </application>
</manifest>
```

Replace `YOUR_LIFF_ID` with your actual LIFF ID and adjust the `android:scheme` and `android:host` values as needed.

## Step 3: Configuring for iOS

For iOS, you need to modify the `Info.plist` file to include the following:

```xml
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
    <string>line</string>
</array>
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
    <dict>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
        <array>
            <string>yourapp</string>
        </array>
    </dict>
</array>
```

Make sure to replace `yourapp` with the appropriate scheme you defined in your Android configuration.

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that we have configured the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initialize and use the `flutter_line_liff` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_line_liff/flutter_line_liff.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('LINE LIFF Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initialize the LIFF SDK
              await LineLiff.init('YOUR_LIFF_ID');

              // Get the user's profile
              final profile = await LineLiff.getProfile();
              print('User ID: ${profile.userId}');
              print('Display Name: ${profile.displayName}');
            },
            child: Text('Get Profile'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize the LIFF SDK and retrieve the user's profile when the button is pressed.

# Complete Example of Flutter Line LIFF Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_line_liff/flutter_line_liff.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('LINE LIFF Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initialize the LIFF SDK with your LIFF ID
              await LineLiff.init('YOUR_LIFF_ID');

              // Get the user's profile information
              final profile = await LineLiff.getProfile();
              print('User ID: ${profile.userId}'); // Print the user's ID
              print('Display Name: ${profile.displayName}'); // Print the user's display name
            },
            child: Text('Get Profile'), // Button to trigger profile retrieval
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which builds a MaterialApp.
// 2. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, there is an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the LIFF SDK is initialized with the provided LIFF ID.
// 5. After initialization, the app retrieves the user's profile information using LineLiff.getProfile().
// 6. The user's ID and display name are printed to the console for verification.
```
