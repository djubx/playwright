Here's a detailed technical blog on the "native_toast" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Native Toast Flutter Package

The `native_toast` package is a Flutter plugin that allows developers to display native toast messages on both Android and iOS platforms. Toast messages are brief notifications that appear at the bottom of the screen, providing feedback to users without interrupting their workflow. This package is particularly useful for showing transient messages such as success notifications, error alerts, or informational prompts.

## When to Use `native_toast`

You should consider using the `native_toast` package in scenarios such as:
- Displaying success messages after a user action (e.g., form submission).
- Notifying users of errors or warnings without requiring user interaction.
- Providing feedback on background processes (e.g., file uploads).

## Features
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Customizable Duration**: Control how long the toast message is displayed.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API for quick implementation in your Flutter applications.

With these features, `native_toast` enhances user experience by providing timely feedback in a non-intrusive manner.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Native Toast

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `native_toast` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  native_toast: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following permissions if you plan to show toasts that require user interaction:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to show toasts.</string>
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:native_toast/native_toast.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the `NativeToast` class to display toast messages. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
NativeToast.showToast(
  message: "This is a native toast message!",
  duration: ToastDuration.short, // or ToastDuration.long
);
```

### Example Usage in a Flutter App

You can integrate the toast functionality into your Flutter app as follows:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Native Toast Example")),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              NativeToast.showToast(
                message: "Button Pressed!",
                duration: ToastDuration.short,
              );
            },
            child: Text("Show Toast"),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a simple Flutter application with a button that, when pressed, displays a native toast message.

# Complete Example of Native Toast in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:native_toast/native_toast.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Native Toast Example")),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Show a toast message when the button is pressed
              NativeToast.showToast(
                message: "Button Pressed!",
                duration: ToastDuration.short, // Display for a short duration
              );
            },
            child: Text("Show Toast"),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Native Toast Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold has a Center widget that centers its child.
// 5. The child is an ElevatedButton that, when pressed, triggers the onPressed callback.
// 6. Inside the onPressed callback, the NativeToast.showToast method is called to display a toast message.
// 7. The toast message "Button Pressed!" appears at the bottom of the screen for a short duration, providing feedback to the user.
```
