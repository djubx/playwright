# Tutorial: Setting Up Elastic Drawer in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up and using the `elastic_drawer` package in a Flutter application. We will cover platform-specific configurations for both Android and iOS to ensure smooth operation.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

First, add the `elastic_drawer` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  elastic_drawer: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Basic Setup

Create a new Flutter project or open an existing one. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:elastic_drawer/elastic_drawer.dart';
```

## Step 3: Implementing Elastic Drawer

### Android Configuration

Ensure your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, ensure you have the following configuration in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Elastic Drawer

In your main Dart file, use the `ElasticDrawer` widget to wrap your main application widget:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ElasticDrawer(
      mainChild: MainScreen(),
      drawerChild: DrawerScreen(),
    );
  }
}
```

### Customization

You can customize the drawer by modifying properties such as `drawerWidth`, `drawerColor`, and more.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:elastic_drawer/elastic_drawer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Elastic Drawer Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ElasticDrawer(
      // Main content of the app
      mainChild: MainScreen(),
      // Content of the drawer
      drawerChild: DrawerScreen(),
      // Width of the drawer
      drawerWidth: 250.0,
      // Color of the drawer
      drawerColor: Colors.blueGrey,
    );
  }
}

class MainScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Elastic Drawer Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Swipe from the left to open the drawer!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DrawerScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      color: Colors.blueGrey,
      child: ListView(
        children: <Widget>[
          DrawerHeader(
            child: Text('Drawer Header', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white)),
            decoration: BoxDecoration(
              color: Colors.blue,
            ),
          ),
          ListTile(
            title: Text('Item 1'),
            onTap: () {
              // Handle the tap
            },
          ),
          ListTile(
            title: Text('Item 2'),
            onTap: () {
              // Handle the tap
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow:
// 1. The `MyApp` class initializes the application and sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. `RealFlutter` is the main widget that uses `ElasticDrawer` to create a drawer with elastic effect.
// 3. `ElasticDrawer` takes two children: `MainScreen` for the main content and `DrawerScreen` for the drawer content.
// 4. `MainScreen` displays a simple message and an AppBar.
// 5. `DrawerScreen` contains a header and a list of items, which can be customized further.
// 6. The drawer can be opened by swiping from the left, revealing the `DrawerScreen` content with an elastic animation.
