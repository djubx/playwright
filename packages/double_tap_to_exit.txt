# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Double Tap to Exit Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `double_tap_to_exit` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  double_tap_to_exit: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:double_tap_to_exit/double_tap_to_exit.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Wrap your main application widget with `DoubleTapToExit` widget. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: DoubleTapToExit(
        child: HomeScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the correct permissions set. Typically, no additional permissions are required for this package, but ensure your app is set up correctly for Flutter.

#### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your app's deployment target is set to a version that supports the package. You may also need to configure your app's Info.plist if you are using any specific features that require permissions.

## Step 4: Customizing the Exit Duration

You can customize the duration within which the second tap must occur by using the `duration` parameter:

```dart
DoubleTapToExit(
  duration: Duration(seconds: 1), // Customize the duration
  child: HomeScreen(),
)
```

This allows you to tailor the user experience based on your app's needs.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the `double_tap_to_exit` package into your Flutter application seamlessly.

# Complete Example of Using Double Tap to Exit

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:double_tap_to_exit/double_tap_to_exit.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Double Tap to Exit Example',
      home: DoubleTapToExit(
        child: HomeScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Double tap to exit the app',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The home screen is wrapped in the DoubleTapToExit widget, which listens for double taps.
// 4. When the user double taps within the specified duration, the app will exit.
// 5. The HomeScreen widget displays a simple message instructing the user to double tap to exit.
// 6. This setup ensures that users have a clear understanding of how to exit the app intentionally.
