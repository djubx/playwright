# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Capped Progress Indicator

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `capped_progress_indicator` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  capped_progress_indicator: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Capped Progress Indicator

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the `CappedProgressIndicator` in your widget tree:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:capped_progress_indicator/capped_progress_indicator.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Capped Progress Indicator Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: CappedProgressIndicator(
            value: 0.7, // Progress value between 0.0 and 1.0
            capSize: 20.0, // Size of the cap
            backgroundColor: Colors.grey[300], // Background color
            valueColor: AlwaysStoppedAnimation<Color>(Colors.blue), // Progress color
            strokeWidth: 10.0, // Width of the progress line
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays a capped progress indicator in the center of the screen. You can customize the `value`, `capSize`, `backgroundColor`, `valueColor`, and `strokeWidth` to fit your design needs.

# Complete Example of Capped Progress Indicator

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:capped_progress_indicator/capped_progress_indicator.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Capped Progress Indicator Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          // Center widget to align the progress indicator
          child: CappedProgressIndicator(
            value: 0.7, // Set the progress value (70% completed)
            capSize: 20.0, // Set the size of the cap
            backgroundColor: Colors.grey[300], // Background color of the indicator
            valueColor: AlwaysStoppedAnimation<Color>(Colors.blue), // Color of the progress
            strokeWidth: 10.0, // Width of the progress line
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Capped Progress Indicator Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered using the Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a CappedProgressIndicator is created.
// 6. The progress indicator is set to 70% completion (value: 0.7) with a cap size of 20.0.
// 7. The background color is set to a light grey, and the progress color is set to blue.
// 8. The stroke width of the progress line is set to 10.0, making it visually appealing.
// 9. The application displays the capped progress indicator in the center of the screen.
