# Tutorial: Setting Up the ContactUs Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the ContactUs package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, you need to add the ContactUs package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  contactus: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to access the internet. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following line inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration
For iOS, you need to ensure that your app has the appropriate permissions set in the `Info.plist` file. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the ContactUs widget.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:contactus/contactus.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Contact Us Example'),
        ),
        body: ContactUs(
          logo: AssetImage('assets/logo.png'), // Your app logo
          email: 'support@example.com',
          phoneNumber: '123-456-7890',
          companyName: 'Your Company',
          githubUserName: 'your_github_username',
          linkedinURL: 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/yourprofile',
          facebookURL: 'https://www.facebook.com/yourprofile',
          twitterHandle: 'your_twitter_handle',
          instagramURL: 'https://www.instagram.com/yourprofile',
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that includes a contact form. The `ContactUs` widget is configured with various parameters such as email, phone number, and social media links.

# Complete Example of ContactUs Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:contactus/contactus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Contact Us Example'), // Title of the app
        ),
        body: ContactUs(
          logo: AssetImage('assets/logo.png'), // Your app logo
          email: 'support@example.com', // Support email
          phoneNumber: '123-456-7890', // Support phone number
          companyName: 'Your Company', // Company name
          githubUserName: 'your_github_username', // GitHub username
          linkedinURL: 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/yourprofile', // LinkedIn profile
          facebookURL: 'https://www.facebook.com/yourprofile', // Facebook profile
          twitterHandle: 'your_twitter_handle', // Twitter handle
          instagramURL: 'https://www.instagram.com/yourprofile', // Instagram profile
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the main UI.
// 3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// 4. The AppBar displays the title of the application.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains the ContactUs widget.
// 6. The ContactUs widget is configured with various parameters such as logo, email, phone number, and social media links.
// 7. When the app runs, users can see the contact form and reach out via the provided methods.
```
