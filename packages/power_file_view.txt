# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Power File View

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **power_file_view** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  power_file_view: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/power_file_view).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions to read files:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file to request permission for accessing files:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to display images.</string>
<key>NSDocumentsFolderUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your documents to display files.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the file viewer.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:power_file_view/power_file_view.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Power File View Example',
      home: FileViewerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class FileViewerScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('File Viewer'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Replace with the path to your file
            String filePath = 'path/to/your/file.pdf';
            Navigator.push(
              context,
              MaterialPageRoute(
                builder: (context) => PowerFileView(filePath: filePath),
              ),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Open File'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app with a button that opens a file viewer when pressed. The `PowerFileView` widget takes the file path as an argument and displays the file accordingly.

# Complete Example of Power File View

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:power_file_view/power_file_view.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Power File View Example',
      home: FileViewerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class FileViewerScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('File Viewer'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Replace with the path to your file
            String filePath = 'path/to/your/file.pdf';
            // Navigate to the PowerFileView screen with the file path
            Navigator.push(
              context,
              MaterialPageRoute(
                builder: (context) => PowerFileView(filePath: filePath),
              ),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Open File'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The home screen is set to FileViewerScreen, which contains a button.
// 3. When the button is pressed, it triggers the onPressed callback.
// 4. Inside the callback, we define the file path to the PDF file we want to view.
// 5. We then navigate to the PowerFileView screen, passing the file path.
// 6. The PowerFileView widget takes care of rendering the file based on the provided path.
```
