# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Square Percent Indicator

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `square_percent_indicator` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  square_percent_indicator: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `SquarePercentIndicator` in your app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:square_percent_indicator/square_percent_indicator.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Square Percent Indicator Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: SquarePercentIndicator(
            percent: 0.75, // 75% completion
            width: 200.0,
            height: 200.0,
            color: Colors.blue,
            backgroundColor: Colors.grey[300],
            animation: true,
            animationDuration: 1200,
            center: Text(
              '75%',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

This code creates a simple Flutter application that displays a square percent indicator showing 75% completion. You can customize the `percent`, `width`, `height`, `color`, and other properties to fit your design needs.

With these steps, you should be able to successfully integrate and use the `square_percent_indicator` package in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Square Percent Indicator

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:square_percent_indicator/square_percent_indicator.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Square Percent Indicator Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          // Centering the SquarePercentIndicator widget
          child: SquarePercentIndicator(
            percent: 0.75, // Setting the completion percentage to 75%
            width: 200.0, // Width of the indicator
            height: 200.0, // Height of the indicator
            color: Colors.blue, // Color of the progress indicator
            backgroundColor: Colors.grey[300], // Background color of the indicator
            animation: true, // Enabling animation
            animationDuration: 1200, // Duration of the animation in milliseconds
            center: Text(
              '75%', // Center text showing the percentage
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold), // Text style
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the RealFlutter application
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application, which calls runApp().
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the UI.
// 3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// 4. The AppBar displays the title of the application.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 6. The SquarePercentIndicator widget is created with a 75% completion rate.
// 7. The indicator has customizable properties like width, height, colors, and animation.
// 8. The center of the indicator displays the text '75%' in a bold style.
