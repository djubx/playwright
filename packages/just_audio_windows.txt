# Tutorial: Setting Up Just Audio Windows

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **just_audio_windows** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the **just_audio_windows** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the new dependencies.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Windows Configuration

1. **Enable Windows Desktop Support**: Ensure that your Flutter environment is set up for Windows development. You can check this by running:
   ```bash
   flutter doctor
   ```

2. **Add Required Permissions**: If your application requires internet access for streaming audio, ensure that your `pubspec.yaml` includes the necessary permissions.

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in a Flutter application.

1. **Import the Package**:
   ```dart
   import 'package:just_audio/just_audio.dart';
   ```

2. **Create an Instance of the AudioPlayer**:
   ```dart
   final AudioPlayer player = AudioPlayer();
   ```

3. **Load an Audio Source**:
   ```dart
   await player.setUrl('https://www.example.com/audio.mp3');
   ```

4. **Control Playback**:
   ```dart
   player.play(); // Start playback
   player.pause(); // Pause playback
   player.stop(); // Stop playback
   ```

5. **Listen for Events**:
   ```dart
   player.playerStateStream.listen((state) {
     // Handle playback state changes
   });
   ```

With these steps, you can easily integrate audio playback into your Flutter application using the **just_audio_windows** package.

# Complete Example of Just Audio Windows

Hereâ€™s a complete example of a Flutter application using the **just_audio_windows** package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:just_audio/just_audio.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Create an instance of AudioPlayer
  final AudioPlayer _player = AudioPlayer();
  bool _isPlaying = false;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Load an audio source when the app starts
    _loadAudio();
  }

  Future<void> _loadAudio() async {
    try {
      // Set the audio source to a URL
      await _player.setUrl('https://www.example.com/audio.mp3');
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors during loading
      print("Error loading audio: $e");
    }
  }

  void _togglePlayback() {
    // Toggle play/pause based on current state
    if (_isPlaying) {
      _player.pause();
    } else {
      _player.play();
    }
    setState(() {
      _isPlaying = !_isPlaying; // Update the playing state
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the player when the widget is removed
    _player.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Just Audio Windows Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: _togglePlayback, // Toggle playback on button press
            child: Text(_isPlaying ? 'Pause' : 'Play'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the initState method, we load the audio from a specified URL.
// 3. The user can toggle playback by pressing the button, which calls _togglePlayback.
// 4. The button's label changes based on whether the audio is currently playing or paused.
// 5. When the widget is disposed, we ensure to clean up the AudioPlayer instance.
```
