# Overview of the chatgpt_completions Flutter Package

The `chatgpt_completions` package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who want to integrate OpenAI's ChatGPT capabilities into their applications. This package allows developers to easily access the ChatGPT API, enabling them to generate text completions based on user input. 

## When to Use This Package
- **Chat Applications**: If you're building a chat application that requires intelligent responses, this package is ideal.
- **Content Generation**: Use it for applications that need to generate content dynamically based on user prompts.
- **Interactive Learning Tools**: Perfect for educational apps that provide explanations or answers to user queries.

## Key Features
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API calls to interact with ChatGPT.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Control the behavior of the model with parameters like temperature and max tokens.
- **Asynchronous Support**: Built-in support for asynchronous operations, making it suitable for real-time applications.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling to manage API response issues gracefully.

This package is a great choice for developers looking to leverage AI capabilities in their Flutter applications.

# Setting Up the chatgpt_completions Package

## Installation
To get started with the `chatgpt_completions` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  chatgpt_completions: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to allow network requests:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Usage
To use the package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:chatgpt_completions/chatgpt_completions.dart';
```

You will also need to initialize the API with your OpenAI API key:

```dart
final chatGpt = ChatGptCompletions(apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY');
```

Now you can call the API to get completions based on user input.

# Complete Example of Using chatgpt_completions

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:chatgpt_completions/chatgpt_completions.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController();
  final ChatGptCompletions chatGpt = ChatGptCompletions(apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY');
  String _response = '';

  // Function to get response from ChatGPT
  Future<void> _getResponse() async {
    // Clear previous response
    setState(() {
      _response = '';
    });

    // Call the ChatGPT API
    try {
      final result = await chatGpt.complete(prompt: _controller.text);
      // Update the response state with the result
      setState(() {
        _response = result;
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during the API call
      setState(() {
        _response = 'Error: $e';
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('ChatGPT Flutter Example')),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Column(
            children: [
              TextField(
                controller: _controller,
                decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter your question'),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 10),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _getResponse,
                child: Text('Get Response'),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              Text('Response: $_response'),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the user input and the response.
// 3. A TextEditingController is used to capture user input from the TextField.
// 4. When the user presses the "Get Response" button, the _getResponse function is called.
// 5. This function clears any previous response and makes an API call to ChatGPT with the user's input.
// 6. If the API call is successful, the response is displayed; if there's an error, it shows an error message.
// 7. The UI updates automatically to reflect the new state.
```
