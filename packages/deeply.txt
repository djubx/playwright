# Deeply Flutter Package: A Comprehensive Overview

The **Deeply** Flutter package is designed to simplify the management of deeply nested data structures in Flutter applications. It provides a powerful and flexible way to handle complex data models, making it easier for developers to work with hierarchical data without getting bogged down in boilerplate code.

## When to Use Deeply

You might consider using the Deeply package in scenarios such as:
- Managing complex JSON data from APIs that have nested structures.
- Building applications that require dynamic forms with nested fields.
- Handling state management for deeply nested widgets in a clean and efficient manner.

## Key Features

- **Deep Data Access**: Easily access and manipulate deeply nested data structures.
- **Reactive Updates**: Automatically update UI components when the underlying data changes.
- **Type Safety**: Leverage Dart's strong typing to ensure data integrity.
- **Custom Serialization**: Support for custom serialization and deserialization of nested data.

With these features, Deeply helps streamline the development process, allowing developers to focus on building features rather than managing data complexity.

# Deeply Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation

To get started with the Deeply package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  deeply: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage

To use the Deeply package, you will typically start by defining your data model. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a nested data structure and access it using the Deeply package.

```dart
import 'package:deeply/deeply.dart';

class User {
  String name;
  Address address;

  User({required this.name, required this.address});
}

class Address {
  String street;
  String city;

  Address({required this.street, required this.city});
}

// Example of creating a user with nested address
User user = User(
  name: 'John Doe',
  address: Address(street: '123 Main St', city: 'Anytown'),
);

// Accessing nested data
String userCity = user.address.city; // 'Anytown'
```

This example demonstrates how to create a user with a nested address and access the city property.

# Complete Example of Using the Deeply Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:deeply/deeply.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Deeply Example',
      home: UserProfile(),
    );
  }
}

class UserProfile extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _UserProfileState createState() => _UserProfileState();
}

class _UserProfileState extends State<UserProfile> {
  // Creating a user with nested address
  User user = User(
    name: 'John Doe',
    address: Address(street: '123 Main St', city: 'Anytown'),
  );

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('User Profile'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
          children: [
            // Displaying user name
            Text('Name: ${user.name}', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20)),
            SizedBox(height: 10),
            // Displaying user address
            Text('Address: ${user.address.street}, ${user.address.city}', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16)),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets UserProfile as the home widget.
// 3. UserProfile is a StatefulWidget that maintains the user data.
// 4. In the _UserProfileState, a User object is created with nested Address data.
// 5. The build method constructs the UI, displaying the user's name and address in a column.
// 6. The UI updates reactively if the user data changes, thanks to the Deeply package's capabilities.
