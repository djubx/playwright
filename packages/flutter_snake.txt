In summary, the code flows as follows:

1.  The user runs the app, and the `RealFlutter` widget is created.
2.  The `RealFlutter` widget builds the `MaterialApp` with a `Scaffold` as its home.
3.  The `Scaffold` contains an `AppBar` with a title and a `Center` widget as its body.
4.  The `Center` widget contains a `Snake` widget with a `Container` as its child.
5.  The `Snake` widget creates a snake animation around the `Container`.
6.  The user can adjust the animation speed and thickness by modifying the `speed` and `thickness` properties of the `Snake` widget.
