# Complete Example of Using the Flutter Snake Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_snake/flutter_snake.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Snake Game',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.green,
      ),
      home: SnakeGameScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class SnakeGameScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SnakeGameScreenState createState() => _SnakeGameScreenState();
}

class _SnakeGameScreenState extends State<SnakeGameScreen> {
  // Create an instance of the SnakeGame
  late SnakeGame _snakeGame;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the SnakeGame with desired parameters
    _snakeGame = SnakeGame(
      onGameOver: _onGameOver, // Callback for game over
      speed: 300, // Set the speed of the snake
      gridSize: 20, // Set the grid size for the game
    );
  }

  void _onGameOver() {
    // Show a dialog when the game is over
    showDialog(
      context: context,
      builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
        title: Text('Game Over'),
        content: Text('Your score: ${_snakeGame.score}'),
        actions: [
          TextButton(
            onPressed: () {
              Navigator.of(context).pop();
              setState(() {
                _snakeGame.reset(); // Reset the game
              });
            },
            child: Text('Play Again'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Snake Game'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: _snakeGame, // Display the SnakeGame widget
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home screen is set to SnakeGameScreen.
// 4. In SnakeGameScreen, we initialize the SnakeGame instance in initState.
// 5. The SnakeGame widget is displayed in the center of the screen.
// 6. When the game is over, the _onGameOver method is called, showing a dialog with the score.
// 7. The user can choose to play again, which resets the game state.
