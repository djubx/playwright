# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Icon Font Generator

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **icon_font_generator** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency
First, add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  icon_font_generator: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/icon_font_generator).

## Step 2: Create Icon Font
You can create your custom icon font using various online tools like [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/) or [Fontello](http://fontello.com/). Once you have your icon font, download the `.ttf` file and the associated CSS or JSON file.

## Step 3: Configure for Android
1. Place the `.ttf` file in the `assets/fonts/` directory of your Flutter project.
2. Update your `pubspec.yaml` to include the font:

```yaml
flutter:
  fonts:
    - family: YourIconFont
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/your_icon_font.ttf
```

## Step 4: Configure for iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following entry to include your font:

```xml
<key>UIAppFonts</key>
<array>
  <string>your_icon_font.ttf</string>
</array>
```

## Step 5: Using the Icon Font
Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s how to use the `RealFlutter` class to display icons.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:icon_font_generator/icon_font_generator.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Icon Font Generator Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: IconFont(
            icon: 'your_icon_name', // Replace with your icon name
            size: 50.0,
            color: Colors.blue,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, replace `'your_icon_name'` with the actual name of the icon you want to display from your custom font.

# Complete Example of Icon Font Generator

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:icon_font_generator/icon_font_generator.dart';

// Main class for the Flutter application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Icon Font Generator Example'), // Title of the app
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying the custom icon using IconFont widget
              IconFont(
                icon: 'your_icon_name', // Replace with your icon name
                size: 50.0, // Size of the icon
                color: Colors.blue, // Color of the icon
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between icons
              Text(
                'Custom Icon', // Text below the icon
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the RealFlutter app
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
3. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the IconFont and Text widgets vertically.
4. The IconFont widget displays a custom icon specified by 'your_icon_name' with a size of 50.0 and a blue color.
5. Below the icon, a Text widget displays the label "Custom Icon".
6. The app is structured to be simple and demonstrates how to integrate and display a custom icon using the icon_font_generator package.
