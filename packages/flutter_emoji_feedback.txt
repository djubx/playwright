# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_emoji_feedback

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_emoji_feedback` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_emoji_feedback: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you plan to use any features that require user permissions. However, for basic emoji feedback, no special permissions are required.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement emoji feedback in your app.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_emoji_feedback/flutter_emoji_feedback.dart';
```

2. Create a widget that utilizes the `EmojiFeedback` widget:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Emoji Feedback Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: EmojiFeedback(
          onFeedback: (emoji) {
            // Handle the emoji feedback here
            print('User selected: $emoji');
          },
          emojis: ['üòÄ', 'üò¢', 'üò°', 'üòç', 'üòé'], // Custom emoji list
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Run your application:

```bash
flutter run
```

This will display a simple app with emoji feedback functionality. Users can select an emoji, and the selected emoji will be printed to the console.

With these steps, you have successfully integrated the `flutter_emoji_feedback` package into your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of flutter_emoji_feedback

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_emoji_feedback/flutter_emoji_feedback.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Emoji Feedback Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Emoji Feedback Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: EmojiFeedback(
          onFeedback: (emoji) {
            // This callback is triggered when an emoji is selected
            print('User selected: $emoji'); // Log the selected emoji
          },
          emojis: ['üòÄ', 'üò¢', 'üò°', 'üòç', 'üòé'], // List of emojis to display
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to RealFlutter, which is the main screen of the app.
// 4. RealFlutter builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, the EmojiFeedback widget is used to display emoji options.
// 6. When a user selects an emoji, the onFeedback callback is triggered, logging the selected emoji to the console.
