# Overview of the get_mac_address Flutter Package

The `get_mac_address` Flutter package is a simple yet powerful tool that allows developers to retrieve the MAC address of the device on which their Flutter application is running. This can be particularly useful for applications that require device identification, network management, or any functionality that relies on unique device identification.

## When to Use This Package
- **Device Identification**: When you need to uniquely identify devices for user authentication or tracking.
- **Network Management**: Useful in applications that manage network connections or require device-specific configurations.
- **IoT Applications**: Essential for Internet of Things (IoT) applications where device identification is crucial.

## Key Features
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Simple API**: Easy to use with a straightforward API for fetching the MAC address.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Utilizes asynchronous programming to ensure smooth performance without blocking the UI.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using get_mac_address

## Installation
To use the `get_mac_address` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  get_mac_address: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Then, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, you need to ensure that your app has the necessary permissions to access network state. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permission:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you do not need to add any specific permissions to access the MAC address. However, ensure that your app's deployment target is set to at least iOS 9.0 in your `ios/Podfile`.

## Using the Package
Once you have installed the package and configured your project, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to retrieve the MAC address.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:get_mac_address/get_mac_address.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _macAddress = 'Unknown';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _getMacAddress();
  }

  Future<void> _getMacAddress() async {
    String macAddress;
    try {
      macAddress = await GetMacAddress.getMacAddress;
    } catch (e) {
      macAddress = 'Failed to get MAC address: $e';
    }

    setState(() {
      _macAddress = macAddress;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Get MAC Address Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('MAC Address: $_macAddress'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Using get_mac_address

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:get_mac_address/get_mac_address.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _macAddress = 'Unknown'; // Variable to hold the MAC address

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState(); // Call the superclass's initState
    _getMacAddress(); // Call the method to get the MAC address
  }

  // Asynchronous method to fetch the MAC address
  Future<void> _getMacAddress() async {
    String macAddress; // Variable to store the fetched MAC address
    try {
      macAddress = await GetMacAddress.getMacAddress; // Fetch the MAC address
    } catch (e) {
      macAddress = 'Failed to get MAC address: $e'; // Handle any errors
    }

    setState(() {
      _macAddress = macAddress; // Update the state with the fetched MAC address
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Get MAC Address Example'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('MAC Address: $_macAddress'), // Display the MAC address
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget being created.
// 2. In the initState method, _getMacAddress is called to fetch the MAC address.
// 3. The _getMacAddress method attempts to retrieve the MAC address asynchronously.
// 4. If successful, the MAC address is stored in the _macAddress variable.
// 5. If an error occurs, an error message is stored instead.
// 6. The setState method is called to update the UI with the new MAC address.
// 7. The build method constructs the UI, displaying the MAC address in the center of the screen.
