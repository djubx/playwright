# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Equalizer Flutter

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `equalizer_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  equalizer_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request microphone access:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio processing.</string>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the equalizer.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:equalizer_flutter/equalizer_flutter.dart';
```

2. Initialize the equalizer and set the desired frequency bands.

```dart
// Initialize the equalizer
Equalizer equalizer = Equalizer();

// Set the frequency bands
equalizer.setBandLevel(0, 0.5); // Set the first band to 50%
equalizer.setBandLevel(1, 0.7); // Set the second band to 70%
```

3. Apply the equalizer settings to your audio player.

This basic setup allows you to start manipulating audio frequencies in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Equalizer Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:equalizer_flutter/equalizer_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Equalizer Flutter Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: EqualizerDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class EqualizerDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _EqualizerDemoState createState() => _EqualizerDemoState();
}

class _EqualizerDemoState extends State<EqualizerDemo> {
  Equalizer equalizer = Equalizer();
  List<double> bandLevels = List.filled(5, 0.5); // Initialize 5 bands at 50%

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the equalizer
    equalizer.init();
  }

  void setBandLevel(int band, double level) {
    // Set the level for the specified band
    equalizer.setBandLevel(band, level);
    setState(() {
      bandLevels[band] = level; // Update the UI
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    equalizer.release(); // Release resources when done
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Equalizer Flutter Demo'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          for (int i = 0; i < bandLevels.length; i++)
            Slider(
              value: bandLevels[i],
              min: 0.0,
              max: 1.0,
              divisions: 10,
              label: 'Band ${i + 1}: ${bandLevels[i].toStringAsFixed(2)}',
              onChanged: (value) {
                setBandLevel(i, value); // Update band level on slider change
              },
            ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home as EqualizerDemo.
// 3. EqualizerDemo initializes the Equalizer instance and sets up a list of band levels.
// 4. The initState method initializes the equalizer when the widget is created.
// 5. The setBandLevel method updates the equalizer's band level and refreshes the UI.
// 6. The build method creates a slider for each band, allowing users to adjust the levels.
// 7. When a slider is moved, it calls setBandLevel to update the equalizer settings.
// 8. Finally, the dispose method releases the equalizer resources when the widget is removed.
```
