# Fluxivity Flutter Package: A Comprehensive Overview

## Description
Fluxivity is a powerful state management package for Flutter that leverages the Flux architecture to provide a unidirectional data flow. It is designed to simplify the management of application state, making it easier to build scalable and maintainable applications. 

### When to Use Fluxivity
- **Complex State Management**: When your application has complex state interactions that require a clear flow of data.
- **Large Applications**: Ideal for larger applications where managing state can become cumbersome with traditional methods.
- **Reactive Programming**: If you prefer a reactive programming model that allows for easy updates to the UI based on state changes.

### Key Features
- **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Ensures that data flows in one direction, making it easier to track changes and debug.
- **Centralized State Management**: Provides a single source of truth for your application's state.
- **Easy Integration**: Can be easily integrated into existing Flutter applications without significant refactoring.
- **Support for Middleware**: Allows for the addition of middleware to handle side effects, such as API calls or logging.

# Fluxivity Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with Fluxivity, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  fluxivity: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No specific configurations are required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use Fluxivity, you need to create a store, actions, and a dispatcher. Hereâ€™s a simple example to illustrate the setup:

1. **Create a Store**: This will hold your application state.
2. **Define Actions**: These are the events that will modify the state.
3. **Create a Dispatcher**: This will handle the flow of actions to the store.

### Example Setup
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fluxivity/fluxivity.dart';

// Define your application state
class AppState {
  int counter;

  AppState({this.counter = 0});
}

// Define actions
class IncrementAction {}

// Create a store
class AppStore extends Store<AppState> {
  AppStore() : super(AppState());

  @override
  void onAction(action) {
    if (action is IncrementAction) {
      state.counter++;
      notifyListeners(); // Notify listeners of state change
    }
  }
}

// Create a dispatcher
final AppStore appStore = AppStore();

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: CounterPage(),
    );
  }
}

class CounterPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Fluxivity Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the counter value
            ValueListenableBuilder<AppState>(
              valueListenable: appStore,
              builder: (context, state, child) {
                return Text('Counter: ${state.counter}');
              },
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                appStore.dispatch(IncrementAction()); // Dispatch action
              },
              child: Text('Increment'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Fluxivity in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fluxivity/fluxivity.dart';

// Define your application state
class AppState {
  int counter; // Counter variable to hold the state

  AppState({this.counter = 0}); // Initialize counter to 0
}

// Define actions
class IncrementAction {} // Action to increment the counter

// Create a store
class AppStore extends Store<AppState> {
  AppStore() : super(AppState()); // Initialize the store with the initial state

  @override
  void onAction(action) {
    if (action is IncrementAction) {
      state.counter++; // Increment the counter
      notifyListeners(); // Notify listeners of state change
    }
  }
}

// Create a dispatcher
final AppStore appStore = AppStore(); // Instantiate the store

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp()); // Run the application
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: CounterPage(), // Set the home page to CounterPage
    );
  }
}

class CounterPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Fluxivity Example')), // App bar title
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the counter value
            ValueListenableBuilder<AppState>(
              valueListenable: appStore, // Listen to the store
              builder: (context, state, child) {
                return Text('Counter: ${state.counter}'); // Show current counter
              },
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                appStore.dispatch(IncrementAction()); // Dispatch action to increment
              },
              child: Text('Increment'), // Button text
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which runs MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds the MaterialApp and sets CounterPage as the home widget.
// 3. CounterPage builds a UI with a Text widget to display the current counter value.
// 4. The ValueListenableBuilder listens to changes in the appStore.
// 5. When the button is pressed, an IncrementAction is dispatched to the store.
// 6. The store updates the state and notifies listeners, causing the UI to rebuild with the new counter value.
