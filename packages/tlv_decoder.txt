# TLV Decoder Flutter Package

The `tlv_decoder` package is a specialized Flutter library designed for decoding TLV (Tag-Length-Value) encoded data. TLV is a common data encoding scheme used in various protocols, especially in telecommunications and networking. This package simplifies the process of parsing TLV data structures, making it easier for developers to work with such data formats in their Flutter applications.

## When to Use This Package
You might consider using the `tlv_decoder` package in scenarios such as:
- Parsing data from smart cards or RFID tags.
- Handling network protocols that utilize TLV encoding.
- Interfacing with APIs that return TLV formatted responses.

## Features
- **Easy Decoding**: Simplifies the process of decoding TLV data into usable Dart objects.
- **Customizable**: Allows for the definition of custom tags and their corresponding data types.
- **Error Handling**: Provides mechanisms to handle errors during the decoding process.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead, making it suitable for performance-sensitive applications.

Overall, the `tlv_decoder` package is a powerful tool for developers needing to work with TLV encoded data in their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Using the TLV Decoder Package

## Installation
To use the `tlv_decoder` package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  tlv_decoder: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
The `tlv_decoder` package is designed to work seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms. There are no additional platform-specific configurations required for basic usage. However, ensure that your Flutter environment is set up correctly for both platforms.

## Basic Usage
To use the `tlv_decoder` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:tlv_decoder/tlv_decoder.dart';
```

You can then create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class (or any class you choose) to start decoding TLV data. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to decode a TLV encoded byte array:

```dart
void main() {
  // Sample TLV data
  List<int> tlvData = [0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04]; // Example TLV data
  RealFlutter decoder = RealFlutter();

  // Decode the TLV data
  var decodedData = decoder.decode(tlvData);
  print(decodedData);
}
```

This example demonstrates the basic decoding functionality of the `tlv_decoder` package. You can expand upon this by defining custom tags and handling more complex TLV structures as needed.

# Complete Example of TLV Decoder in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tlv_decoder/tlv_decoder.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'TLV Decoder Example',
      home: TLVDecoderScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class TLVDecoderScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _TLVDecoderScreenState createState() => _TLVDecoderScreenState();
}

class _TLVDecoderScreenState extends State<TLVDecoderScreen> {
  String _decodedOutput = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _decodeTLVData();
  }

  void _decodeTLVData() {
    // Sample TLV data
    List<int> tlvData = [0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04]; // Example TLV data
    RealFlutter decoder = RealFlutter();

    // Decode the TLV data
    var decodedData = decoder.decode(tlvData);
    
    // Update the state with the decoded data
    setState(() {
      _decodedOutput = decodedData.toString();
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('TLV Decoder Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Decoded Output: $_decodedOutput',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app and sets MyApp as the root widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (TLVDecoderScreen).
// 3. TLVDecoderScreen is a stateful widget that manages the state of the decoded output.
// 4. In the initState method, _decodeTLVData is called to decode the sample TLV data.
// 5. The _decodeTLVData method creates an instance of RealFlutter and decodes the TLV data.
// 6. The decoded data is then set to the _decodedOutput state variable.
// 7. The build method displays the decoded output in the center of the screen.
