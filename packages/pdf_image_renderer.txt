# pdf_image_renderer Flutter Package

The `pdf_image_renderer` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to render PDF documents as images. This package is particularly useful in applications that require displaying PDF content without the need for a full PDF viewer. It allows developers to convert PDF pages into images, which can then be displayed in various widgets, making it ideal for applications like document viewers, e-book readers, or any app that needs to showcase PDF content in a more user-friendly format.

## When to Use This Package
- **Document Viewing**: When you want to display PDF documents in a Flutter app without using a full-fledged PDF viewer.
- **Image Generation**: If you need to convert PDF pages into images for further processing or display.
- **Custom PDF Rendering**: When you want to customize how PDF content is displayed in your app.

## Features
- **Page Rendering**: Render specific pages of a PDF document as images.
- **High-Quality Output**: Generate high-resolution images from PDF pages.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that integrates well with existing Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using pdf_image_renderer

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `pdf_image_renderer` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the `pdf_image_renderer` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  pdf_image_renderer: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/pdf_image_renderer).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration
For iOS, you may need to add the following permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you are accessing files from the device:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to select PDF files.</string>
<key>NSDocumentsFolderUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your documents to select PDF files.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to render a PDF page as an image.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pdf_image_renderer/pdf_image_renderer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'PDF Image Renderer Example',
      home: PDFViewer(),
    );
  }
}

class PDFViewer extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PDFViewerState createState() => _PDFViewerState();
}

class _PDFViewerState extends State<PDFViewer> {
  // Variable to hold the rendered image
  Image? pdfImage;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Load the PDF and render the first page as an image
    _loadPDF();
  }

  Future<void> _loadPDF() async {
    // Load the PDF document from assets
    final pdfDocument = await PdfImageRendererPdf.createFromAsset('assets/sample.pdf');
    
    // Render the first page of the PDF as an image
    final pdfPage = await pdfDocument.getPage(0);
    final image = await pdfPage.render(width: 300, height: 400);
    
    // Update the state with the rendered image
    setState(() {
      pdfImage = Image.memory(image);
    });
    
    // Dispose of the page and document to free resources
    pdfPage.dispose();
    pdfDocument.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('PDF Image Renderer'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        // Display the rendered PDF image or a loading indicator
        child: pdfImage ?? CircularProgressIndicator(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
 
// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application that uses the pdf_image_renderer package to render a PDF document as an image.
// 
// 1. **Main Function**: The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` widget.
// 2. **RealFlutter Widget**: This is the root widget of the application, which sets up the MaterialApp and the home page as `PDFViewer`.
// 3. **PDFViewer Widget**: This stateful widget is responsible for loading and displaying the PDF image.
// 4. **initState Method**: When the widget is initialized, it calls `_loadPDF` to load the PDF document and render the first page.
// 5. **_loadPDF Method**: This asynchronous method loads the PDF from the assets, renders the first page as an image, and updates the state to display the image.
// 6. **Build Method**: The `build` method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget that displays either the rendered image or a loading indicator while the image is being processed.

In summary, the `pdf_image_renderer` package provides a straightforward way to render PDF documents as images in Flutter applications. By following the setup and usage instructions outlined in this blog, developers can easily integrate PDF rendering capabilities into their apps, enhancing the user experience with visually appealing document displays.
