# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `ai_progress`

## Installation
To add the `ai_progress` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ai_progress: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No specific configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your app requires network access or other capabilities.

## Using the Package
To use the `ai_progress` package, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:ai_progress/ai_progress.dart';
```

You can then create a simple progress indicator using the `RealFlutter` class. Below is a basic example of how to implement it in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of `ai_progress`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ai_progress/ai_progress.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  double _progress = 0.0; // Variable to hold the progress value

  // Function to simulate a long-running task
  void _simulateProgress() async {
    for (int i = 0; i <= 100; i++) {
      await Future.delayed(Duration(milliseconds: 50)); // Simulate work
      setState(() {
        _progress = i / 100; // Update progress
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _simulateProgress(); // Start the progress simulation when the widget is initialized
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('AI Progress Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Display the progress indicator
              AiProgress(
                progress: _progress, // Pass the current progress
                width: 200, // Width of the progress indicator
                height: 20, // Height of the progress indicator
                backgroundColor: Colors.grey[300], // Background color
                progressColor: Colors.blue, // Progress color
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              Text('${(_progress * 100).toStringAsFixed(0)}%'), // Display percentage
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatefulWidget that maintains the progress state.
// 3. In the initState method, the _simulateProgress function is called to start updating the progress.
// 4. The _simulateProgress function simulates a long-running task by incrementing the progress value every 50 milliseconds.
// 5. The progress value is updated using setState, which triggers a rebuild of the widget.
// 6. The build method returns a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 7. Inside the Center widget, an AiProgress widget displays the current progress visually, and a Text widget shows the percentage.
