# Geometry Kit: A Comprehensive Overview

The **geometry_kit** Flutter package is a powerful tool designed for developers who need to work with geometric shapes and calculations in their applications. This package simplifies the process of creating and manipulating various geometric forms, making it an excellent choice for applications that require custom graphics, animations, or spatial calculations.

## When to Use Geometry Kit
- **Custom Graphics**: When you need to draw complex shapes or patterns.
- **Game Development**: For calculating positions, collisions, and movements of objects.
- **Data Visualization**: To create charts or graphs that require geometric calculations.

## Key Features
- **Shape Creation**: Easily create shapes like circles, rectangles, polygons, and more.
- **Transformations**: Apply transformations such as translation, rotation, and scaling to shapes.
- **Collision Detection**: Built-in methods for detecting collisions between shapes.
- **Path Drawing**: Create paths for animations or custom drawing.

The geometry_kit package is ideal for developers looking to enhance their Flutter applications with advanced geometric capabilities.

# Geometry Kit: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To add the geometry_kit package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  geometry_kit: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run the following command to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No specific configurations are required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the geometry_kit package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:geometry_kit/geometry_kit.dart';
```

You can then create shapes and perform operations on them. Hereâ€™s a simple example of creating a circle and a rectangle:

```dart
void main() {
  Circle circle = Circle(radius: 50);
  Rectangle rectangle = Rectangle(width: 100, height: 50);
  
  // Perform operations
  double areaCircle = circle.area();
  double areaRectangle = rectangle.area();
  
  print('Area of Circle: $areaCircle');
  print('Area of Rectangle: $areaRectangle');
}
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to create basic shapes and calculate their areas using the geometry_kit package.

# Complete Example of Geometry Kit in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:geometry_kit/geometry_kit.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Geometry Kit Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Geometry Kit Demo'),
        ),
        body: GeometryDemo(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class GeometryDemo extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a circle and a rectangle
    Circle circle = Circle(radius: 50);
    Rectangle rectangle = Rectangle(width: 100, height: 50);
    
    // Calculate areas
    double areaCircle = circle.area();
    double areaRectangle = rectangle.area();

    return Center(
      child: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: [
          Text('Area of Circle: $areaCircle'),
          Text('Area of Rectangle: $areaRectangle'),
          // Draw the shapes using custom painter
          CustomPaint(
            size: Size(200, 200),
            painter: ShapePainter(circle, rectangle),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

class ShapePainter extends CustomPainter {
  final Circle circle;
  final Rectangle rectangle;

  ShapePainter(this.circle, this.rectangle);

  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    // Draw the circle
    Paint circlePaint = Paint()..color = Colors.blue;
    canvas.drawCircle(Offset(100, 100), circle.radius, circlePaint);

    // Draw the rectangle
    Paint rectPaint = Paint()..color = Colors.red;
    canvas.drawRect(Rect.fromLTWH(50, 150, rectangle.width, rectangle.height), rectPaint);
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(covariant CustomPainter oldDelegate) {
    return false;
  }
}

// Explanation of the application flow:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The GeometryDemo widget is created, which contains the logic for shape creation and area calculation.
// 4. Inside GeometryDemo, a Circle and a Rectangle are instantiated.
// 5. The areas of both shapes are calculated and displayed in the center of the screen.
// 6. A CustomPaint widget is used to draw the shapes on the canvas.
// 7. The ShapePainter class handles the actual drawing of the circle and rectangle using the Canvas API.
```
