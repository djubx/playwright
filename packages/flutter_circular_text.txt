# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_circular_text

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `flutter_circular_text` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_circular_text: ^0.2.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement circular text in your app.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_circular_text/flutter_circular_text.dart';
```

2. Create a widget that uses `CircularText` to display text in a circular format:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Circular Text Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: CircularText(
          children: [
            TextItem(
              text: Text('Hello, Flutter!'),
              space: 20,
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.blue),
            ),
            TextItem(
              text: Text('Circular Text'),
              space: 20,
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.red),
            ),
          ],
          radius: 100,
          position: CircularTextPosition.inside,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Run your application to see the circular text in action.

# Complete Example of flutter_circular_text

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_circular_text/flutter_circular_text.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Circular Text Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Circular Text Example'), // Title of the app
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: CircularText(
          children: [
            TextItem(
              text: Text('Hello, Flutter!'), // First text item
              space: 20, // Space between text items
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.blue), // Style for the first text
            ),
            TextItem(
              text: Text('Circular Text'), // Second text item
              space: 20, // Space between text items
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.red), // Style for the second text
            ),
          ],
          radius: 100, // Radius of the circular text
          position: CircularTextPosition.inside, // Positioning of the text
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with MyApp().
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme, and specifies RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, CircularText is used to display two text items in a circular layout.
// 5. Each TextItem has its own text, space, and style, and they are arranged in a circle with a specified radius.
// 6. The app displays the circular text in the center of the screen, showcasing the features of the flutter_circular_text package.
