# Overview of the `blurhash_dart` Flutter Package

The `blurhash_dart` package is a Flutter implementation of the BlurHash algorithm, which allows developers to create a placeholder for images that are being loaded. This is particularly useful in applications where images may take time to load, providing a smooth user experience by displaying a blurred version of the image instead of a blank space.

## When to Use `blurhash_dart`

- **Image Loading**: When displaying images from the network, you can use BlurHash to show a blurred placeholder while the actual image is being fetched.
- **Performance Optimization**: It helps in reducing the perceived loading time of images, enhancing the overall user experience.
- **Aesthetic Appeal**: The blurred placeholders can be visually appealing and can maintain the layout of your application while images are loading.

## Features

- **Easy Integration**: Simple to add to your Flutter project.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Customizable**: You can adjust the size and quality of the generated blurhash.

In summary, `blurhash_dart` is an excellent choice for Flutter developers looking to improve the user experience of their applications by providing smooth image loading experiences.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `blurhash_dart`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with `blurhash_dart`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  blurhash_dart: ^0.6.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the `blurhash_dart` package in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:blurhash_dart/blurhash_dart.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('BlurHash Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: BlurHash(
            hash: 'LEHV6nWB2yk8pyo0adR*.7kCMdnj', // Example hash
            image: 'https://example.com/image.jpg', // Actual image URL
            imageFit: BoxFit.cover,
            duration: Duration(milliseconds: 500),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `BlurHash` widget takes a `hash` and an `image` URL. The `hash` is a string representation of the blurred image, while the `image` is the actual image that will be displayed once it is loaded.

## Conclusion

You are now ready to use the `blurhash_dart` package in your Flutter applications. This package will help you create a better user experience by providing smooth image loading with blurred placeholders.

# Complete Example of Using `blurhash_dart`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:blurhash_dart/blurhash_dart.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('BlurHash Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: BlurHash(
            hash: 'LEHV6nWB2yk8pyo0adR*.7kCMdnj', // Example hash for the blurred image
            image: 'https://example.com/image.jpg', // URL of the actual image
            imageFit: BoxFit.cover, // Fit the image to cover the widget
            duration: Duration(milliseconds: 500), // Duration for the fade-in effect
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the `RealFlutter` class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The `MaterialApp` widget is created, providing the basic structure of the app.
// 3. A `Scaffold` widget is used to create the app's visual structure, including an AppBar and a body.
// 4. In the body, a `Center` widget is used to center the `BlurHash` widget.
// 5. The `BlurHash` widget takes a `hash` string that represents the blurred image and an `image` URL for the actual image.
// 6. The `imageFit` property is set to `BoxFit.cover` to ensure the image covers the entire widget area.
// 7. The `duration` property is set to 500 milliseconds, which controls how long it takes for the image to fade in once loaded.
// 8. When the app runs, the blurred placeholder will be displayed first, and once the actual image is loaded, it will fade in smoothly.
