# Nanodart Flutter Package: A Comprehensive Overview

The **nanodart** package is a lightweight and efficient Dart library designed for handling data serialization and deserialization. It is particularly useful for Flutter developers who need to manage data in a structured format, such as JSON, while ensuring optimal performance and minimal overhead. 

## When to Use Nanodart
- **Data Serialization**: When you need to convert Dart objects to JSON and vice versa.
- **API Integration**: Ideal for applications that interact with RESTful APIs, where data exchange is frequent.
- **Performance-Critical Applications**: When you want to minimize the performance impact of data handling in your Flutter app.

## Key Features
- **Lightweight**: Minimal footprint, making it suitable for mobile applications.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple API for serialization and deserialization.
- **Type Safety**: Ensures that the data types are preserved during the conversion process.
- **Customizable**: Allows for custom serialization logic if needed.

Overall, nanodart is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to streamline their data handling processes while maintaining performance and type safety.

# Nanodart Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To add the nanodart package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  nanodart: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run the following command to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your application requires network access for API calls.

## Basic Usage
To use the nanodart package, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create a Dart model class** that represents the data structure you want to serialize.
2. **Use the nanodart methods** to convert between your Dart objects and JSON.

Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:nanodart/nanodart.dart';

class User {
  String name;
  int age;

  User({required this.name, required this.age});

  // Convert a User object into a Map object
  Map<String, dynamic> toJson() => {
        'name': name,
        'age': age,
      };

  // Extract a User object from a Map object
  static User fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) {
    return User(
      name: json['name'],
      age: json['age'],
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we define a `User` class with methods to convert to and from JSON. You can now use these methods to serialize and deserialize your data easily.

# Complete Example of Using Nanodart in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:nanodart/nanodart.dart';

// Define the User class with serialization methods
class User {
  String name;
  int age;

  User({required this.name, required this.age});

  // Convert a User object into a Map object
  Map<String, dynamic> toJson() => {
        'name': name,
        'age': age,
      };

  // Extract a User object from a Map object
  static User fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) {
    return User(
      name: json['name'],
      age: json['age'],
    );
  }
}

// Main application class
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Nanodart Example',
      home: UserScreen(),
    );
  }
}

// UserScreen widget to display user information
class UserScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a User object
    User user = User(name: 'Alice', age: 30);

    // Serialize the User object to JSON
    String userJson = user.toJson().toString();

    // Deserialize the JSON back to a User object
    User newUser = User.fromJson({'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30});

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Nanodart Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('User JSON: $userJson'), // Display serialized JSON
            Text('User Name: ${newUser.name}'), // Display deserialized User name
            Text('User Age: ${newUser.age}'), // Display deserialized User age
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets UserScreen as the home widget.
// 3. UserScreen creates a User object and serializes it to JSON using toJson() method.
// 4. The JSON string is displayed on the screen.
// 5. The JSON is then deserialized back into a User object using fromJson() method.
// 6. The deserialized User's name and age are displayed on the screen.
