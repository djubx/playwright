# Tutorial: Using the Focused Menu Custom Flutter Package
=====================================================

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up and using the `focused_menu_custom` Flutter package.

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

To use the `focused_menu_custom` package, you need to add it to your project's `pubspec.yaml` file. You can do this by adding the following line to the `dependencies` section:

```yml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  focused_menu_custom: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

To use the package, you need to import it into your Dart file. You can do this by adding the following line at the top of your file:

```dart
import 'package:focused_menu_custom/focused_menu_custom.dart';
```

### Step 3: Create a Menu

To create a menu, you need to create a `FocusedMenu` widget and pass it a list of `FocusedMenuItem` widgets. Here is an example:

```dart
FocusedMenu(
  items: [
    FocusedMenuItem(
      title: Text('Item 1'),
      onPressed: () {
        print('Item 1 pressed');
      },
    ),
    FocusedMenuItem(
      title: Text('Item 2'),
      onPressed: () {
        print('Item 2 pressed');
      },
    ),
  ],
)
```

### Step 4: Customize the Menu

You can customize the menu by passing various properties to the `FocusedMenu` widget. For example, you can change the menu's layout by passing a `FlexDirection` value:

```dart
FocusedMenu(
  direction: FlexDirection.column,
  items: [
    // ...
  ],
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details

The `focused_menu_custom` package is compatible with various platforms, including Android and iOS. However, you may need to make some platform-specific adjustments to get the best results.

For example, on Android, you may need to adjust the menu's elevation to ensure that it appears above other widgets:

```dart
FocusedMenu(
  elevation: 10,
  items: [
    // ...
  ],
)
```

On iOS, you may need to adjust the menu's shadow to ensure that it appears correctly:

```dart
FocusedMenu(
  shadowColor: Colors.black,
  shadowBlurRadius: 10,
  items: [
    // ...
  ],
)
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:focused_menu_custom/focused_menu_custom.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Focused Menu Custom Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Focused Menu Custom Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: FocusedMenu(
          // Create a menu with three items
          items: [
            FocusedMenuItem(
              title: Text('Item 1'),
              onPressed: () {
                print('Item 1 pressed');
              },
            ),
            FocusedMenuItem(
              title: Text('Item 2'),
              onPressed: () {
                print('Item 2 pressed');
              },
            ),
            FocusedMenuItem(
              title: Text('Item 3'),
              onPressed: () {
                print('Item 3 pressed');
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a screen containing a menu.
// 2. The menu is created using the FocusedMenu widget and contains three items.
// 3. When the user presses an item, the corresponding onPressed callback is called.
// 4. The onPressed callback prints a message to the console indicating which item was pressed.
// 5. The user can continue to interact with the menu by pressing different items.
// 6. The app continues to run until the user closes it.

// In summary, this code creates a simple menu using the FocusedMenu widget and handles user input by printing messages to the console.
