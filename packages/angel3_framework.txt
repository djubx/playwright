# Setting Up the Angel3 Framework in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the Angel3 Framework in a Flutter application. We will cover platform-specific details for both Android and iOS.

## Step 1: Add Dependencies

To get started, add the `angel3_framework` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  angel3_framework: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Configure Android

For Android, you need to ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21. Open the `android/app/build.gradle` file and modify the `defaultConfig` section:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Configure iOS

For iOS, you need to enable the necessary permissions in your `Info.plist` file. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Initialize the Angel3 Framework

In your Flutter application, you will need to initialize the Angel3 Framework. Hereâ€™s how you can do it in your `main.dart` file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:angel3_framework/angel3_framework.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Angel3 Framework Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Angel3 Framework Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to Angel3 Framework!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Run Your Application

Now that you have set up everything, you can run your application using:

```bash
flutter run
```

This will launch your Flutter application, and you should see the welcome message on the screen.

# Complete Example of Angel3 Framework in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:angel3_framework/angel3_framework.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Angel3 Framework Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  // Create an instance of the Angel3 server
  final Angel app = Angel();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Start the server when the widget is initialized
    startServer();
  }

  void startServer() async {
    // Define a simple route
    app.get('/api/message', (req, res) {
      res.write('Hello from Angel3 Framework!');
      res.close();
    });

    // Start the server on port 3000
    await app.startServer('localhost', 3000);
    print('Server running on http://localhost:3000');
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Angel3 Framework Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: fetchMessage,
          child: Text('Fetch Message from Server'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void fetchMessage() async {
    // Make a GET request to the server
    final response = await http.get(Uri.parse('http://localhost:3000/api/message'));
    // Show the response in a dialog
    showDialog(
      context: context,
      builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
        title: Text('Server Response'),
        content: Text(response.body),
        actions: [
          TextButton(
            onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
            child: Text('Close'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds the MaterialApp and sets the HomeScreen as the home widget.
// 3. In the HomeScreen, an instance of the Angel server is created.
// 4. The server is started in the initState method, defining a simple route that responds with a message.
// 5. When the user taps the button, the fetchMessage method is called, which makes a GET request to the server.
// 6. The server responds with a message, which is displayed in a dialog box.
```
