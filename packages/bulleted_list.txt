# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Bulleted List Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started with the **bulleted_list** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  bulleted_list: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:bulleted_list/bulleted_list.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Bulleted List Widget
You can now use the `BulletedList` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
BulletedList(
  items: [
    'Item 1',
    'Item 2',
    'Item 3',
  ],
)
```

This will create a simple bulleted list with three items.

# Complete Example of Using the Bulleted List Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bulleted_list/bulleted_list.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Bulleted List Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Bulleted List Example'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Column(
            crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
            children: [
              Text(
                'Features of the Bulleted List Package:',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 10),
              // Using the BulletedList widget to display a list of features
              BulletedList(
                items: [
                  'Customizable bullet points',
                  'Flexible layout options',
                  'Easy integration with Flutter',
                  'Supports vertical and horizontal lists',
                ],
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Bulleted List Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold has a Padding widget to provide space around the content.
// 5. Inside the body, a Column widget is used to arrange the text and bulleted list vertically.
// 6. A Text widget displays the title 'Features of the Bulleted List Package'.
// 7. A SizedBox is added for spacing.
// 8. The BulletedList widget is used to display a list of features, each item represented as a bullet point.
