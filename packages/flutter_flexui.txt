# Setting Up and Using the Flutter FlexUI Package

## Installation
To get started with the `flutter_flexui` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_flexui: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version of the package. After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, make sure your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
Once the package is installed, you can start using its features. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a responsive layout using `flutter_flexui`:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_flexui/flutter_flexui.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('FlexUI Example')),
      body: FlexUI(
        direction: Axis.vertical,
        children: [
          Container(color: Colors.red, height: 100),
          Container(color: Colors.green, height: 100),
          Container(color: Colors.blue, height: 100),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a vertical layout with three colored containers. The `FlexUI` widget automatically adjusts the layout based on the available screen space.

With these steps, you are now ready to leverage the `flutter_flexui` package in your Flutter applications!

# Complete Example of Flutter FlexUI

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_flexui/flutter_flexui.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter FlexUI Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('FlexUI Example')),
        body: FlexUI(
          direction: Axis.vertical, // Set the direction of the FlexUI
          children: [
            Container(
              color: Colors.red, // First child container
              height: 100, // Fixed height
              child: Center(child: Text('Red Container')),
            ),
            Container(
              color: Colors.green, // Second child container
              height: 100, // Fixed height
              child: Center(child: Text('Green Container')),
            ),
            Container(
              color: Colors.blue, // Third child container
              height: 100, // Fixed height
              child: Center(child: Text('Blue Container')),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body uses the FlexUI widget to create a vertical layout.
// 5. Inside the FlexUI, three containers are defined with different colors.
// 6. Each container has a fixed height and contains centered text.
// 7. The FlexUI automatically arranges the containers vertically, adapting to the screen size.
