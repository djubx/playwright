        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a screen displaying three country flags.
// 2. The flags are displayed using the `Flag` widget, which takes the country code, width, and height as parameters.
// 3. The country codes are used to determine which flag to display.
// 4. The flags are displayed in a column, with a SizedBox widget used to add space between each flag.
// 5. The user can view the flags and close the app when finished.
