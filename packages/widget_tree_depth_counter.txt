# Overview of the `widget_tree_depth_counter` Flutter Package

The `widget_tree_depth_counter` package is a useful tool for Flutter developers who want to analyze the depth of their widget trees. Understanding the depth of widget trees can help in optimizing performance and debugging layout issues. This package provides a simple way to count the depth of the widget tree, which can be particularly beneficial in large applications where widget nesting can become complex.

## When to Use This Package
- **Performance Optimization**: If you notice performance issues in your Flutter app, analyzing the widget tree depth can help identify overly nested widgets.
- **Debugging Layout Issues**: When dealing with layout problems, knowing the depth of your widget tree can provide insights into potential issues.
- **Educational Purposes**: For developers learning Flutter, this package can help visualize and understand how widget trees are structured.

## Key Features
- **Depth Counting**: Easily count the depth of the widget tree.
- **Real-time Updates**: The package can provide real-time updates on the widget tree depth as the UI changes.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead added to your application, making it suitable for production use.

# Setting Up and Using the `widget_tree_depth_counter` Package

## Installation
To use the `widget_tree_depth_counter` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  widget_tree_depth_counter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/widget_tree_depth_counter).

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No specific configurations are required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`.

## Usage
After installing the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Import the package at the top of your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:widget_tree_depth_counter/widget_tree_depth_counter.dart';
```

You can then use the `WidgetTreeDepthCounter` widget to wrap your main application widget. This will allow you to monitor the depth of your widget tree.

```dart
WidgetTreeDepthCounter(
  child: MyApp(),
)
```

This setup will enable the depth counter and display the current depth of the widget tree in your application.

# Complete Example of Using `widget_tree_depth_counter`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:widget_tree_depth_counter/widget_tree_depth_counter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Wrapping the main app with WidgetTreeDepthCounter
    return WidgetTreeDepthCounter(
      child: MaterialApp(
        title: 'Widget Tree Depth Counter Example',
        home: HomeScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Scaffold provides a basic material design visual layout structure
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Widget Tree Depth Counter'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Press the button to add more widgets:',
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // This button adds more nested widgets to the tree
                Navigator.push(
                  context,
                  MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => NestedScreen()),
                );
              },
              child: Text('Add Nested Widget'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class NestedScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // This screen adds additional depth to the widget tree
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Nested Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('You are now in a nested screen!'),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Navigating back to the previous screen
                Navigator.pop(context);
              },
              child: Text('Go Back'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that wraps the MaterialApp with WidgetTreeDepthCounter.
// 3. The HomeScreen is displayed, which contains a button to navigate to NestedScreen.
// 4. When the button is pressed, it pushes NestedScreen onto the navigation stack, increasing the widget tree depth.
// 5. NestedScreen displays a message and a button to go back, which pops the screen off the stack, reducing the depth.
