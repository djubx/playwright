Here’s a detailed technical blog on the "lint_staged" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Lint Staged Flutter Package

The `lint_staged` package is a powerful tool designed to help Flutter developers enforce code quality and consistency by running linting and formatting checks on staged files before they are committed to version control. This package integrates seamlessly with Git, allowing developers to automate the process of ensuring that only code that meets specified quality standards is committed.

## When to Use `lint_staged`

You should consider using `lint_staged` in the following scenarios:

- **Team Projects**: When working in a team, it’s crucial to maintain a consistent code style. `lint_staged` helps enforce this by running checks on files that are about to be committed.
- **Continuous Integration**: Integrating `lint_staged` into your CI/CD pipeline ensures that only code that passes linting checks is merged into the main branch.
- **Preventing Bad Commits**: It acts as a safeguard against committing code that does not meet your project's coding standards.

## Features

- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automatically runs linting and formatting tools on staged files.
- **Customizable**: You can configure which tools to run and under what conditions.
- **Performance**: Only checks files that are staged for commit, making it faster than running checks on the entire codebase.

# Tutorial: Setting Up `lint_staged` in Your Flutter Project

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `lint_staged` package in a Flutter project. We will cover platform-specific details for both Android and iOS.

## Step 1: Add Dependencies

First, you need to add the `lint_staged` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under `dev_dependencies`:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  lint_staged: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Configure Git Hooks

Next, you need to set up Git hooks to use `lint_staged`. Create a file named `lint-staged.config.js` in the root of your project and add the following configuration:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  '*.{dart}': [
    'flutter format',
    'flutter analyze',
  ],
};
```

This configuration tells `lint_staged` to run `flutter format` and `flutter analyze` on any staged Dart files.

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### For Android

1. Ensure that your Android project is set up to use the latest version of the Flutter SDK.
2. You may need to configure your `build.gradle` file to include any additional linting tools you want to use.

### For iOS

1. Open your iOS project in Xcode and ensure that you have the latest version of the Flutter SDK.
2. You can also add any additional linting tools in your `Podfile` if necessary.

## Step 4: Testing the Setup

To test if everything is set up correctly, make a change to a Dart file, stage the change using `git add`, and then try to commit. You should see the linting and formatting tools run automatically.

## Step 5: Customizing Linting Rules

You can customize the linting rules by modifying the `lint-staged.config.js` file. For example, you can add additional commands or specify different file types to check.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  '*.{dart,md}': [
    'flutter format',
    'flutter analyze',
    'markdownlint',
  ],
};
```

This configuration will also run `markdownlint` on staged Markdown files.

# Complete Example of Using `lint_staged`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Main application class
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Lint Staged Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

// Home page widget
class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Lint Staged Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Welcome to the Lint Staged Example!',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. It calls runApp() with an instance of the RealFlutter class.
// 3. The RealFlutter class builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 4. The home property of MaterialApp is set to MyHomePage, which is the main screen of the app.
// 5. MyHomePage builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a centered Text widget.
// 6. The Text widget displays a welcome message to the user.
```
