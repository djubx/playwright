# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Media Store Plus

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `media_store_plus` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `media_store_plus` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  media_store_plus: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/media_store_plus).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
   ```

2. **Target SDK**: Ensure your `compileSdkVersion` and `targetSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` are set to at least 31 to comply with the latest Android storage policies.

### iOS Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request permission to access the photo library:

   ```xml
   <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
   <string>This app requires access to your photo library.</string>
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to retrieve and display images from the device's media store.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:media_store_plus/media_store_plus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Media Store Plus Example',
      home: MediaGallery(),
    );
  }
}

class MediaGallery extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MediaGalleryState createState() => _MediaGalleryState();
}

class _MediaGalleryState extends State<MediaGallery> {
  List<MediaFile> _mediaFiles = []; // List to hold media files

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _fetchMediaFiles(); // Fetch media files when the widget is initialized
  }

  // Function to fetch media files from the device
  Future<void> _fetchMediaFiles() async {
    try {
      // Request permissions to access media files
      await MediaStorePlus.requestPermissions();

      // Retrieve media files from the device
      final mediaFiles = await MediaStorePlus.getMediaFiles();
      setState(() {
        _mediaFiles = mediaFiles; // Update the state with the retrieved media files
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during the fetching process
      print('Error fetching media files: $e');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Media Gallery'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: _mediaFiles.isEmpty
          ? Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator()) // Show loading indicator if no media files are found
          : GridView.builder(
              gridDelegate: SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount(
                crossAxisCount: 3, // Number of columns in the grid
              ),
              itemCount: _mediaFiles.length, // Total number of media files
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                return Image.file(
                  File(_mediaFiles[index].path), // Display the media file as an image
                  fit: BoxFit.cover, // Fit the image to cover the grid cell
                );
              },
            ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home page (MediaGallery).
// 3. The MediaGallery widget is a stateful widget that fetches media files when initialized.
// 4. In the _fetchMediaFiles method, permissions are requested, and media files are retrieved from the device.
// 5. The retrieved media files are stored in the _mediaFiles list and displayed in a grid view.
// 6. If no media files are found, a loading indicator is shown until the files are fetched.
