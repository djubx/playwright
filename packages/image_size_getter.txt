Here's a detailed technical blog on the "image_size_getter" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Image Size Getter Flutter Package

The **image_size_getter** package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that allows you to retrieve the dimensions of images from various sources, including local assets, network URLs, and file paths. This package is particularly useful when you need to display images in a responsive manner or when you want to perform operations based on the image size, such as adjusting layouts or optimizing performance.

## When to Use This Package

- **Dynamic Layouts**: When building responsive UIs that need to adapt based on image dimensions.
- **Image Optimization**: To ensure that images are loaded and displayed efficiently, especially in lists or grids.
- **Preprocessing**: When you need to know the size of an image before performing operations like cropping or resizing.

## Features

- **Support for Multiple Image Sources**: Retrieve image sizes from local assets, network URLs, and file paths.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Non-blocking calls to fetch image dimensions, ensuring smooth UI performance.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in mechanisms to handle errors gracefully when fetching image sizes.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Image Size Getter Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `image_size_getter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  image_size_getter: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:image_size_getter/image_size_getter.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

### For Local Assets

1. Ensure your image is included in your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/images/sample_image.jpg
```

2. Use the package to get the image size:

```dart
final size = ImageSizeGetter.getSizeFromAsset('assets/images/sample_image.jpg');
```

### For Network Images

To get the size of an image from a URL:

```dart
final size = await ImageSizeGetter.getSizeFromUrl('https://example.com/image.jpg');
```

### For File Paths

To get the size of an image from a file path:

```dart
final size = await ImageSizeGetter.getSizeFromFile('/path/to/image.jpg');
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

Ensure you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` if you are accessing images from external storage:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS

For iOS, ensure you have the appropriate permissions set in your `Info.plist` if accessing images from the user's photo library:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to get image sizes.</string>
```

## Optimizations

- **Caching**: Consider caching image sizes if you are fetching them frequently to improve performance.
- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to manage cases where images cannot be loaded or their sizes cannot be retrieved.

# Complete Example: Using Image Size Getter in a Flutter App

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:image_size_getter/image_size_getter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Image Size Getter Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Image Size Getter Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: FutureBuilder<Size>(
            // Fetching the size of a local asset image
            future: getImageSize(),
            builder: (context, snapshot) {
              if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                // While waiting for the image size, show a loading indicator
                return CircularProgressIndicator();
              } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
                // If there is an error, display it
                return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}');
              } else {
                // Once the size is retrieved, display it
                final size = snapshot.data!;
                return Text('Image Size: ${size.width} x ${size.height}');
              }
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to get the size of the image
  Future<Size> getImageSize() async {
    // Getting the size of a local asset image
    return await ImageSizeGetter.getSizeFromAsset('assets/images/sample_image.jpg');
  }
}
```

```dart
// Explanation of the application flow:

// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, a FutureBuilder is used to asynchronously fetch the size of a local asset image.
// 4. The future property of the FutureBuilder calls the getImageSize function, which retrieves the image size.
// 5. While waiting for the image size, a CircularProgressIndicator is displayed.
// 6. If an error occurs during the fetching process, it is displayed as text.
// 7. Once the image size is successfully retrieved, it is displayed in the center of the screen in the format "Image Size: width x height".
```
