# Setting Up and Using the Flutter Editable Table Package

## Installation
To get started with the `flutter_editable_table` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_editable_table: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_editable_table).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file, depending on your app's requirements. However, the `flutter_editable_table` package does not require any specific configurations for basic usage.

## Basic Usage
To use the `flutter_editable_table` package, you can create a simple editable table in your Flutter application. Below is a basic example of how to implement it.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_editable_table/flutter_editable_table.dart';
```

2. Create a stateful widget to manage the table's state:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Define your data source
  List<List<String>> data = [
    ['Item 1', '10', 'Available'],
    ['Item 2', '20', 'Out of Stock'],
    ['Item 3', '15', 'Available'],
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Editable Table Example')),
      body: EditableTable(
        data: data,
        onChanged: (newData) {
          setState(() {
            data = newData; // Update the data when changes are made
          });
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic editable table where users can modify the data directly. The `onChanged` callback updates the state whenever the data changes.

# Complete Example of Flutter Editable Table

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_editable_table/flutter_editable_table.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Editable Table Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Define your data source
  List<List<String>> data = [
    ['Item 1', '10', 'Available'],
    ['Item 2', '20', 'Out of Stock'],
    ['Item 3', '15', 'Available'],
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Editable Table Example')),
      body: EditableTable(
        data: data,
        onChanged: (newData) {
          setState(() {
            data = newData; // Update the data when changes are made
          });
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets MyApp as the home widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home screen.
// 3. RealFlutter is a stateful widget that maintains the state of the editable table.
// 4. The data source is defined as a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row in the table.
// 5. The EditableTable widget is used to display the data, allowing users to edit the cells.
// 6. The onChanged callback updates the state with the new data whenever a cell is edited, ensuring the UI reflects the latest changes.
