# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Simple Animated Rating Bar

## Installation
To use the `simple_animated_rating_bar` package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  simple_animated_rating_bar: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if you are using any features that require user permissions. However, the `simple_animated_rating_bar` does not require any specific permissions.

## Usage
To use the `simple_animated_rating_bar`, you can import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:simple_animated_rating_bar/simple_animated_rating_bar.dart';
```

You can then create a simple rating bar widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
SimpleAnimatedRatingBar(
  rating: 3.5, // Current rating
  onRatingChanged: (rating) {
    // Handle rating change
    print("New rating: $rating");
  },
  starCount: 5, // Total number of stars
  starSize: 30.0, // Size of each star
  activeColor: Colors.amber, // Color of filled stars
  inactiveColor: Colors.grey, // Color of unfilled stars
),
```

This code snippet creates a rating bar with 5 stars, where the current rating is set to 3.5. The `onRatingChanged` callback allows you to handle changes in the rating.

With these steps, you can easily integrate the `simple_animated_rating_bar` into your Flutter application and customize it to fit your design needs.

# Complete Example of Simple Animated Rating Bar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simple_animated_rating_bar/simple_animated_rating_bar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Simple Animated Rating Bar Example',
      home: RatingPage(),
    );
  }
}

class RatingPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RatingPageState createState() => _RatingPageState();
}

class _RatingPageState extends State<RatingPage> {
  double _currentRating = 3.0; // Initial rating

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Rating Bar Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display the animated rating bar
            SimpleAnimatedRatingBar(
              rating: _currentRating, // Current rating
              onRatingChanged: (rating) {
                // Update the state with the new rating
                setState(() {
                  _currentRating = rating; // Update the current rating
                });
              },
              starCount: 5, // Total number of stars
              starSize: 40.0, // Size of each star
              activeColor: Colors.amber, // Color of filled stars
              inactiveColor: Colors.grey, // Color of unfilled stars
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Add some space
            // Display the current rating as text
            Text(
              'Current Rating: $_currentRating',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. The home of the app is set to RatingPage, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 4. In the RatingPage, we maintain the current rating state with _currentRating.
// 5. The SimpleAnimatedRatingBar widget is displayed, which takes the current rating and a callback for when the rating changes.
// 6. When the user interacts with the rating bar, the onRatingChanged callback updates the _currentRating state.
// 7. The updated rating is displayed below the rating bar in a Text widget.
