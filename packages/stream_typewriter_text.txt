# Complete Example of Stream Typewriter Text

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:stream_typewriter_text/stream_typewriter_text.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Stream Typewriter Text Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Typewriter Effect Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: TypewriterTextWidget(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class TypewriterTextWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a stream of text to be displayed
    final Stream<String> textStream = Stream.periodic(
      Duration(seconds: 1),
      (count) => 'This is line ${count + 1}',
    ).take(5); // Limit to 5 lines

    return StreamTypewriterText(
      stream: textStream, // Pass the stream to the widget
      style: TextStyle(
        fontSize: 24, // Set the font size
        color: Colors.black, // Set the text color
      ),
      speed: Duration(milliseconds: 100), // Set typing speed
      pauseDuration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Pause after each line
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds TypewriterTextWidget.
// 4. TypewriterTextWidget creates a stream that emits a new line of text every second.
// 5. The StreamTypewriterText widget listens to the stream and displays each line with a typewriter effect.
// 6. The text is styled with a font size of 24 and black color, and the typing speed is set to 100 milliseconds.
// 7. After each line, there is a pause of 2 seconds before the next line appears.
```
