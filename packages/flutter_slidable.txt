# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `flutter_slidable`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `flutter_slidable` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_slidable: ^0.6.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Basic Setup

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to enable the use of Swift in your project. Open your `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode and ensure that the project settings are configured to support Swift.

## Step 3: Using `flutter_slidable`

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a sliding list item.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_slidable/flutter_slidable.dart';
```

2. Create a list of items and use `Slidable` to wrap your list items:

```dart
Slidable(
  actionPane: SlidableDrawerActionPane(), // Define the action pane
  actionExtentRatio: 0.25, // Define the extent of the action
  child: ListTile(
    title: Text('Item Title'),
  ),
  secondaryActions: [
    IconSlideAction(
      caption: 'Edit',
      color: Colors.blue,
      icon: Icons.edit,
      onTap: () {
        // Handle edit action
      },
    ),
    IconSlideAction(
      caption: 'Delete',
      color: Colors.red,
      icon: Icons.delete,
      onTap: () {
        // Handle delete action
      },
    ),
  ],
);
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to create a sliding list item with edit and delete actions. You can customize the actions and their appearance as needed.

## Conclusion

The `flutter_slidable` package is a versatile tool for enhancing list interactions in Flutter applications. By following the steps outlined above, you can easily integrate sliding actions into your app, improving user experience and functionality.

# Complete Example of `flutter_slidable`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_slidable/flutter_slidable.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Slidable Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Slidable Example'),
        ),
        body: SlidableList(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SlidableList extends StatelessWidget {
  // Sample data for the list
  final List<String> items = List.generate(20, (index) => 'Item $index');

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ListView.builder(
      itemCount: items.length,
      itemBuilder: (context, index) {
        return Slidable(
          actionPane: SlidableDrawerActionPane(), // Define the action pane
          actionExtentRatio: 0.25, // Define the extent of the action
          child: ListTile(
            title: Text(items[index]), // Display the item title
          ),
          secondaryActions: [
            IconSlideAction(
              caption: 'Edit', // Caption for the edit action
              color: Colors.blue, // Color of the edit action
              icon: Icons.edit, // Icon for the edit action
              onTap: () {
                // Handle edit action
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Edit ${items[index]}')),
                );
              },
            ),
            IconSlideAction(
              caption: 'Delete', // Caption for the delete action
              color: Colors.red, // Color of the delete action
              icon: Icons.delete, // Icon for the delete action
              onTap: () {
                // Handle delete action
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Delete ${items[index]}')),
                );
              },
            ),
          ],
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home scaffold.
// 3. The SlidableList widget is used as the body of the scaffold, which contains a list of items.
// 4. The ListView.builder creates a list of Slidable widgets for each item.
// 5. Each Slidable widget has a ListTile as its child, displaying the item title.
// 6. The secondaryActions property defines the actions available when the item is slid.
// 7. Tapping on the edit or delete actions shows a SnackBar with the corresponding message.
// 8. This setup allows users to interact with the list items through swipe gestures, enhancing the overall user experience.
