# Tutorial: Setting Up the Unsplash Client Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `unsplash_client` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `unsplash_client` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  unsplash_client: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Configure API Key

To use the Unsplash API, you need to sign up for an API key. Follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Unsplash Developer](https://unsplash.com/developers) page.
2. Create a new application to get your access key.
3. Store your access key securely.

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

1. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following lines to allow network requests:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Basic Usage

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in our Flutter application. We will create a simple app that fetches and displays images from Unsplash.

# Complete Example: Unsplash Client in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:unsplash_client/unsplash_client.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Unsplash Client Example',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: UnsplashHome(),
    );
  }
}

class UnsplashHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _UnsplashHomeState createState() => _UnsplashHomeState();
}

class _UnsplashHomeState extends State<UnsplashHome> {
  // Create an instance of UnsplashClient with your access key
  final UnsplashClient client = UnsplashClient(accessKey: 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY');
  List<Photo> photos = []; // List to hold fetched photos
  bool isLoading = true; // Loading state

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    fetchPhotos(); // Fetch photos when the widget is initialized
  }

  // Function to fetch photos from Unsplash
  Future<void> fetchPhotos() async {
    try {
      // Fetch the first page of photos
      final fetchedPhotos = await client.getPhotos(page: 1, perPage: 10);
      setState(() {
        photos = fetchedPhotos; // Update the photos list
        isLoading = false; // Set loading to false
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors
      print('Error fetching photos: $e');
      setState(() {
        isLoading = false; // Set loading to false even on error
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Unsplash Photos')),
      body: isLoading
          ? Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator()) // Show loading indicator
          : GridView.builder(
              gridDelegate: SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount(
                crossAxisCount: 2, // Two columns in the grid
                childAspectRatio: 1, // Aspect ratio for each item
              ),
              itemCount: photos.length, // Number of photos to display
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                return Image.network(photos[index].urls.small); // Display photo
              },
            ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home as UnsplashHome.
// 3. UnsplashHome is a stateful widget that fetches photos from Unsplash when initialized.
// 4. The fetchPhotos function calls the Unsplash API to get a list of photos.
// 5. While loading, a CircularProgressIndicator is displayed.
// 6. Once the photos are fetched, they are displayed in a GridView.
// 7. Each photo is shown using an Image widget that loads the image from the URL.
```
