# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Redirect Icon

## Installation
To add the `redirect_icon` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  redirect_icon: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. The package works out of the box.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your project is set up to support the latest iOS version. You may need to update your `Info.plist` file if you are using any specific permissions related to the actions triggered by the icons.

## Basic Usage
To use the `redirect_icon` package, you can create an instance of the `RedirectIcon` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:redirect_icon/redirect_icon.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Redirect Icon Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: RedirectIcon(
          icon: Icons.home,
          onTap: () {
            // Define the action to be taken when the icon is tapped
            Navigator.push(
              context,
              MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => HomePage()),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, tapping the icon will navigate the user to the `HomePage`.

# Complete Example of Redirect Icon

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:redirect_icon/redirect_icon.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Redirect Icon Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Redirect Icon Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: RedirectIcon(
          icon: Icons.home, // The icon to be displayed
          onTap: () {
            // Action to perform when the icon is tapped
            Navigator.push(
              context,
              MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => HomePage()), // Navigate to HomePage
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// HomePage widget to navigate to
class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home Page')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to the Home Page!'), // Display a welcome message
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is displayed as the home screen, containing a RedirectIcon.
// 3. When the RedirectIcon is tapped, it triggers the onTap function.
// 4. The onTap function uses Navigator to push a new route, leading to the HomePage.
// 5. The HomePage displays a simple welcome message to the user.
