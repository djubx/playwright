# Overview of the xml_annotation Flutter Package

The `xml_annotation` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers who need to work with XML data in their applications. It provides a simple way to annotate Dart classes for XML serialization and deserialization, making it easier to convert between XML and Dart objects. This package is particularly useful when dealing with APIs that return XML data or when you need to read and write XML files.

## When to Use `xml_annotation`

- **API Integration**: When your application interacts with web services that return XML responses.
- **Data Storage**: If you need to store data in XML format for configuration files or data interchange.
- **Legacy Systems**: When working with older systems that utilize XML for data representation.

## Key Features

- **Annotations**: Use annotations to define how Dart classes map to XML elements and attributes.
- **Serialization/Deserialization**: Easily convert Dart objects to XML and vice versa.
- **Customizable**: Supports custom serialization logic for complex data structures.

Overall, `xml_annotation` simplifies the process of working with XML in Flutter, allowing developers to focus on building features rather than handling data conversion manually.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using xml_annotation

## Installation

To get started with `xml_annotation`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

```yaml
dependencies:
  xml_annotation: ^5.0.0
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using xml_annotation

1. **Create a Dart Class**: Define a Dart class that represents the XML structure you want to work with. Use the `@XmlRoot` and `@XmlElement` annotations to specify how the class maps to XML.

2. **Generate Code**: Use the `build_runner` package to generate the serialization code. Add it to your `dev_dependencies`:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  build_runner: ^2.0.0
  xml_serializable: ^5.0.0
```

Run the following command to generate the necessary code:

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build
```

3. **Serialize and Deserialize**: Use the generated code to convert between XML and Dart objects.

This setup allows you to easily manage XML data in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Using xml_annotation

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:xml_annotation/xml_annotation.dart';
import 'package:xml_serializable/xml_serializable.dart';

// Define a Dart class with XML annotations
part 'real_flutter.g.dart'; // Generated file

@XmlRootElement(name: 'person') // Specify the root element
class RealFlutter {
  @XmlElement(name: 'name') // Map the name field to the XML element
  String name;

  @XmlElement(name: 'age') // Map the age field to the XML element
  int age;

  RealFlutter({required this.name, required this.age}); // Constructor

  // Method to convert Dart object to XML
  String toXml() => XmlSerializable.serialize(this);

  // Method to create a Dart object from XML
  static RealFlutter fromXml(String xml) => XmlSerializable.deserialize<RealFlutter>(xml);
}

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'XML Annotation Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('XML Annotation Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Create a RealFlutter object
              RealFlutter person = RealFlutter(name: 'John Doe', age: 30);
              
              // Convert the object to XML
              String xml = person.toXml();
              print('Serialized XML: $xml'); // Print the serialized XML

              // Deserialize the XML back to a RealFlutter object
              RealFlutter newPerson = RealFlutter.fromXml(xml);
              print('Deserialized Person: ${newPerson.name}, Age: ${newPerson.age}'); // Print the deserialized object
            },
            child: Text('Serialize and Deserialize'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
// The application starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up a simple UI with a button.
// When the button is pressed, a RealFlutter object is created with a name and age.
// The object is then serialized to XML format and printed to the console.
// After that, the XML is deserialized back into a RealFlutter object, and its properties are printed.
```
<!-- END_MAIN -->
```

### Summary of the Code Flow

The application begins with the `MyApp` widget, which creates a simple user interface with a button. When the button is pressed, the following steps occur:

1. A `RealFlutter` object is instantiated with a name and age.
2. The `toXml()` method is called to serialize the object into XML format, which is then printed to the console.
3. The `fromXml()` method is used to deserialize the XML back into a `RealFlutter` object.
4. Finally, the properties of the deserialized object are printed to the console.

This example demonstrates how to effectively use the `xml_annotation` package for XML serialization and deserialization in a Flutter application.
