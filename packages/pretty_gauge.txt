Here's a detailed technical blog on the "pretty_gauge" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Pretty Gauge Flutter Package

The **pretty_gauge** package is a Flutter library designed to create visually appealing gauge widgets. It allows developers to display data in a circular gauge format, making it easy to visualize metrics such as progress, performance, or any other quantitative data. This package is particularly useful in applications where data representation is crucial, such as fitness apps, dashboards, or any application that requires a quick visual representation of data.

## When to Use Pretty Gauge

You might consider using the **pretty_gauge** package in scenarios such as:
- Displaying user progress towards a goal (e.g., fitness goals, task completion).
- Visualizing performance metrics (e.g., CPU usage, memory consumption).
- Creating dashboards for data analytics applications.

## Features

- **Customizable Appearance**: You can customize the gauge's colors, sizes, and styles to fit your application's theme.
- **Animation Support**: The package supports animations, making the gauge dynamic and engaging.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that allows for quick integration into existing Flutter applications.

Overall, the **pretty_gauge** package enhances the user experience by providing a clear and attractive way to present data.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Pretty Gauge

## Step 1: Adding Dependency

To use the **pretty_gauge** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  pretty_gauge: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using Pretty Gauge in Your Application

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the **pretty_gauge** widget.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pretty_gauge/pretty_gauge.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Pretty Gauge Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: PrettyGauge(
            value: 75, // Current value
            minValue: 0, // Minimum value
            maxValue: 100, // Maximum value
            gaugeColor: Colors.blue, // Color of the gauge
            needleColor: Colors.red, // Color of the needle
            // Additional customization options can be added here
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays a gauge with a value of 75 out of a maximum of 100. You can customize the gauge's appearance by changing the `gaugeColor`, `needleColor`, and other properties.

# Complete Example of Pretty Gauge

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pretty_gauge/pretty_gauge.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Pretty Gauge Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: PrettyGauge(
            value: 75, // Current value of the gauge
            minValue: 0, // Minimum value of the gauge
            maxValue: 100, // Maximum value of the gauge
            gaugeColor: Colors.blue, // Color of the gauge
            needleColor: Colors.red, // Color of the needle
            // You can customize the gauge further with additional properties
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Entry point of the application
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp().
// 2. The RealFlutter class is instantiated, which builds the MaterialApp widget.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold, which provides the basic structure of the app.
// 4. An AppBar is created with the title 'Pretty Gauge Example'.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 6. Inside the Center widget, a PrettyGauge widget is created with a value of 75.
// 7. The gauge is configured with a minimum value of 0, a maximum value of 100, and custom colors for the gauge and needle.
// 8. The application displays the gauge in the center of the screen, providing a visual representation of the value.
```
