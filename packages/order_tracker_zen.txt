# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Order Tracker Zen

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **order_tracker_zen** package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **order_tracker_zen** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  order_tracker_zen: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` file to allow network requests. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the order tracking feature.

# Complete Example of Order Tracker Zen

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:order_tracker_zen/order_tracker_zen.dart'; // Import the package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the main application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Order Tracker Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: OrderTrackingScreen(), // Set the home screen
    );
  }
}

class OrderTrackingScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _OrderTrackingScreenState createState() => _OrderTrackingScreenState();
}

class _OrderTrackingScreenState extends State<OrderTrackingScreen> {
  // Sample order data
  final Order order = Order(
    id: '12345',
    status: 'Shipped',
    trackingUrl: 'https://example.com/track/12345',
  );

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Order Tracker'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: OrderTrackerZen(
          order: order, // Pass the order data to the tracker
          onStatusChanged: (status) {
            // Callback when the order status changes
            setState(() {
              order.status = status; // Update the order status
            });
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home screen is set to OrderTrackingScreen, which manages the order tracking.
// 4. In OrderTrackingScreen, we create a sample order with an ID, status, and tracking URL.
// 5. The OrderTrackerZen widget is used to display the order tracking interface.
// 6. The onStatusChanged callback updates the order status in the UI when it changes.
```

// The application flow is as follows:
// - The app starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` widget.
// - `RealFlutter` sets up a `MaterialApp` with a title and theme, and the home screen is `OrderTrackingScreen`.
// - In `OrderTrackingScreen`, we define a sample order with an ID, status, and tracking URL.
// - The `OrderTrackerZen` widget is used to display the order tracking interface, passing the order data.
// - When the order status changes, the `onStatusChanged` callback updates the order status in the UI, allowing for real-time updates.
