# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Clean Dialog

## Installation
To use the clean_dialog package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  clean_dialog: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using Clean Dialog
To use the clean_dialog package, you can create a dialog by calling the appropriate methods provided by the package. Below is a simple example of how to implement a basic alert dialog.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:clean_dialog/clean_dialog.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Clean Dialog Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Show a clean dialog when the button is pressed
              CleanDialog.show(
                context: context,
                title: 'Alert',
                description: 'This is a clean dialog example.',
                onConfirm: () {
                  // Action on confirm
                  Navigator.of(context).pop();
                },
              );
            },
            child: Text('Show Dialog'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, a clean dialog appears with a title and description. The dialog also has a confirm action that dismisses it.

# Complete Example of Clean Dialog

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:clean_dialog/clean_dialog.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Clean Dialog Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Show a clean dialog when the button is pressed
              CleanDialog.show(
                context: context,
                title: 'Alert',
                description: 'This is a clean dialog example.',
                onConfirm: () {
                  // Action on confirm
                  Navigator.of(context).pop();
                },
              );
            },
            child: Text('Show Dialog'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The MaterialApp widget is created, providing the overall structure of the app.
// 3. A Scaffold widget is used to create the basic visual layout, including an AppBar and a body.
// 4. In the body, a Center widget is used to center the button on the screen.
// 5. An ElevatedButton is created, which, when pressed, triggers the CleanDialog.show method.
// 6. The CleanDialog.show method displays a dialog with a title and description.
// 7. The onConfirm callback is defined to handle the action when the user confirms the dialog, which simply pops the dialog off the navigation stack.
// 8. The user can interact with the dialog, and upon confirmation, it will close, returning to the main screen.
