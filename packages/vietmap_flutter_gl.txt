# Setting Up and Using vietmap_flutter_gl

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `vietmap_flutter_gl` package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `vietmap_flutter_gl` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  vietmap_flutter_gl: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
   ```

2. **Enable Google Maps API**: Ensure that you have enabled the Google Maps API in your Google Cloud Console and added your API key in the `AndroidManifest.xml`:

   ```xml
   <meta-data
       android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
       android:value="YOUR_API_KEY"/>
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open your `Info.plist` file located in `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys for location permissions:

   ```xml
   <key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need your location to show it on the map.</string>
   <key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need your location to show it on the map.</string>
   ```

2. **Enable Location Services**: Ensure that location services are enabled in your app settings.

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to initialize and display a map using the `vietmap_flutter_gl` package.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:vietmap_flutter_gl/vietmap_flutter_gl.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'VietMap Flutter GL Example',
      home: MapScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class MapScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MapScreenState createState() => _MapScreenState();
}

class _MapScreenState extends State<MapScreen> {
  late VietMapController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the VietMap controller
    _controller = VietMapController(
      onMapCreated: _onMapCreated,
    );
  }

  void _onMapCreated(VietMapController controller) {
    // Set the initial camera position
    controller.moveCamera(
      CameraUpdate.newLatLng(LatLng(21.0285, 105.8542)), // Hanoi coordinates
    );
    // Add a marker to the map
    controller.addMarker(
      MarkerOptions(
        position: LatLng(21.0285, 105.8542),
        infoWindowText: InfoWindowText('Hanoi', 'Capital of Vietnam'),
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('VietMap Flutter GL'),
      ),
      body: VietMap(
        controller: _controller,
        onMapCreated: _onMapCreated,
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds the MaterialApp with a title and home screen.
// 3. The MapScreen widget initializes the VietMapController in its state.
// 4. When the map is created, the _onMapCreated method is called.
// 5. The camera is moved to the specified coordinates (Hanoi).
// 6. A marker is added to the map at the same coordinates with an info window.
// 7. The map is displayed in the body of the Scaffold.
```

In this blog, we have covered the `vietmap_flutter_gl` package in detail, including its description, setup tutorial, and a complete example. The application flow is straightforward: it initializes the map, sets the camera position, and adds a marker, providing a solid foundation for building more complex mapping applications.
