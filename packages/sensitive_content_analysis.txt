Here's a detailed technical blog on the "sensitive_content_analysis" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Sensitive Content Analysis Flutter Package

The `sensitive_content_analysis` Flutter package is designed to help developers identify and manage sensitive content within text inputs in their applications. This package is particularly useful in applications that handle user-generated content, such as social media platforms, forums, or any app that allows users to submit text. By leveraging this package, developers can ensure that sensitive information, such as personal data, hate speech, or explicit content, is flagged and managed appropriately.

## When to Use This Package
- **User-Generated Content**: If your app allows users to submit text, this package can help filter out inappropriate or sensitive content.
- **Compliance**: For applications that need to comply with regulations regarding user data and content moderation.
- **Improving User Experience**: By preventing the display of sensitive content, you can create a safer and more welcoming environment for users.

## Features
- **Content Analysis**: Analyze text for sensitive content, including profanity, hate speech, and personal information.
- **Customizable Filters**: Developers can customize the sensitivity levels and types of content to be flagged.
- **Real-time Analysis**: The package supports real-time content analysis, providing immediate feedback to users.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Sensitive Content Analysis Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `sensitive_content_analysis` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  sensitive_content_analysis: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21.
2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml` if required by your app's functionality.

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add any required permissions for accessing user data or network resources.

## Step 3: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:sensitive_content_analysis/sensitive_content_analysis.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package
You can now use the `SensitiveContentAnalysis` class to analyze text. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
void analyzeText(String input) async {
  final result = await SensitiveContentAnalysis.analyze(input);
  if (result.isSensitive) {
    print("Sensitive content detected!");
  } else {
    print("Content is safe.");
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Customizing Filters
You can customize the filters based on your application's needs:

```dart
void analyzeTextWithCustomFilters(String input) async {
  final filters = ContentFilters(
    profanity: true,
    hateSpeech: true,
    personalInfo: false, // Disable personal info detection
  );

  final result = await SensitiveContentAnalysis.analyze(input, filters: filters);
  // Handle the result as needed
}
```

With these steps, you can effectively integrate the `sensitive_content_analysis` package into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using the Sensitive Content Analysis Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sensitive_content_analysis/sensitive_content_analysis.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sensitive Content Analysis',
      home: SensitiveContentScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class SensitiveContentScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SensitiveContentScreenState createState() => _SensitiveContentScreenState();
}

class _SensitiveContentScreenState extends State<SensitiveContentScreen> {
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController();
  String _resultMessage = '';

  // Function to analyze the input text
  void _analyzeInput() async {
    // Get the input text from the controller
    String inputText = _controller.text;

    // Analyze the text for sensitive content
    final result = await SensitiveContentAnalysis.analyze(inputText);

    // Update the result message based on the analysis
    setState(() {
      _resultMessage = result.isSensitive
          ? "Sensitive content detected!"
          : "Content is safe.";
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Sensitive Content Analysis'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              controller: _controller,
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Enter text to analyze',
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _analyzeInput,
              child: Text('Analyze'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(
              _resultMessage,
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp and points to the SensitiveContentScreen.
// 3. SensitiveContentScreen contains a TextField for user input and a button to trigger analysis.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the _analyzeInput function is called.
// 5. This function retrieves the text from the TextField, analyzes it for sensitive content, and updates the UI with the result.
