# Complete Example of Using Profile View

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:profile_view/profile_view.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Profile View Example',
      home: ProfileScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ProfileScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('User Profile'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ProfileView(
          name: 'John Doe', // User's name
          image: NetworkImage('https://example.com/profile.jpg'), // User's profile image
          bio: 'Flutter Developer and Tech Enthusiast', // User's bio
          contact: 'john.doe@example.com', // User's contact information
          // Additional customization options can be added here
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The ProfileScreen widget is displayed as the home screen, which contains a Scaffold.
// 4. The Scaffold has an AppBar with the title 'User Profile'.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold centers the ProfileView widget.
// 6. The ProfileView widget displays the user's name, profile image, bio, and contact information.
// 7. The image is fetched from a network URL, and the profile view is fully customizable.
