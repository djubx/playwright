# Complete Example of flutter_audio_trimmer

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_audio_trimmer/flutter_audio_trimmer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  final FlutterAudioTrimmer _trimmer = FlutterAudioTrimmer();
  String _audioPath = 'path/to/your/audio/file.mp3'; // Specify your audio file path
  double _startValue = 0.0; // Start trimming position
  double _endValue = 0.0; // End trimming position

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Audio Trimmer Example')),
        body: Column(
          children: [
            // Display the audio trimmer widget
            Trimmer(
              audioFile: File(_audioPath),
              onChange: (start, end) {
                setState(() {
                  _startValue = start; // Update start value
                  _endValue = end; // Update end value
                });
              },
            ),
            // Button to trim the audio
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () async {
                // Call the trim method with the selected start and end values
                await _trimmer.trimAudio(
                  audioFile: _audioPath,
                  startValue: _startValue,
                  endValue: _endValue,
                );
                // Notify user of successful trimming
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Audio trimmed successfully!')),
                );
              },
              child: Text('Trim Audio'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget, we create an instance of FlutterAudioTrimmer.
// 3. We define the audio file path and initialize start and end values for trimming.
// 4. The build method constructs the UI, including the Trimmer widget and a button.
// 5. The Trimmer widget allows users to select the portion of the audio they want to keep.
// 6. When the user presses the "Trim Audio" button, the trimAudio method is called with the selected start and end values.
// 7. Upon successful trimming, a SnackBar notification informs the user of the success.
