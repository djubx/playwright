<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Timeago Flutter Package

The `timeago_flutter` package is a powerful and flexible library for displaying relative time in a user-friendly format. It allows developers to show how long ago an event occurred, such as "5 minutes ago" or "2 days ago," which enhances the user experience by providing context to time-sensitive information.

## When to Use

This package is particularly useful in applications where time representation is crucial, such as:

- Social media apps (e.g., displaying when a post was made)
- Messaging apps (e.g., showing when a message was sent)
- News applications (e.g., indicating when an article was published)

## Features

- **Localization**: Supports multiple languages, allowing you to display time in the user's preferred language.
- **Customizable**: You can customize the format of the time strings.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple API that integrates seamlessly with Flutter applications.

Overall, `timeago_flutter` is an essential tool for any Flutter developer looking to enhance their app's time representation capabilities.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Timeago Flutter

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `timeago_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  timeago_flutter: ^3.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:timeago_flutter/timeago_flutter.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package

You can now use the `Timeago` widget to display relative time. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
Timeago(
  date: DateTime.now().subtract(Duration(minutes: 5)),
  locale: 'en', // Specify the locale
)
```

This will display "5 minutes ago" in the UI.

## Summary

You have now set up the `timeago_flutter` package in your Flutter application. You can customize the display of relative time and ensure it fits well with your app's design and functionality.

# Complete Example of Timeago Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:timeago_flutter/timeago_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Timeago Flutter Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Timeago Flutter Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying time 5 minutes ago
              Timeago(
                date: DateTime.now().subtract(Duration(minutes: 5)),
                locale: 'en',
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Displaying time 2 hours ago
              Timeago(
                date: DateTime.now().subtract(Duration(hours: 2)),
                locale: 'en',
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Displaying time 1 day ago
              Timeago(
                date: DateTime.now().subtract(Duration(days: 1)),
                locale: 'en',
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Timeago Flutter Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Column widget.
// 5. Inside the Column, three Timeago widgets are displayed, each showing a different relative time:
//    - The first shows "5 minutes ago".
//    - The second shows "2 hours ago".
//    - The third shows "1 day ago".
// 6. Each Timeago widget takes a DateTime object that is calculated by subtracting the desired duration from the current time.
// 7. The locale is set to 'en' for English, but this can be changed to support other languages as needed.
