# Overview of the TFTP Flutter Package

The **tftp** Flutter package is designed to facilitate the implementation of the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) in Flutter applications. TFTP is a simple protocol used for transferring files over a network, often utilized in scenarios where a lightweight file transfer solution is required, such as booting devices or transferring firmware.

## When to Use TFTP
- **Embedded Systems**: Ideal for transferring firmware to embedded devices.
- **Network Booting**: Useful in environments where devices need to boot from a network source.
- **Lightweight File Transfers**: Suitable for applications that require simple file transfers without the overhead of more complex protocols.

## Key Features
- **Client and Server Support**: Implements both TFTP client and server functionalities.
- **File Transfer Operations**: Supports reading and writing files over TFTP.
- **Error Handling**: Provides mechanisms to handle common TFTP errors.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

The tftp package is a valuable tool for developers looking to integrate TFTP capabilities into their Flutter applications, especially in network-centric environments.

# Setting Up the TFTP Package in Flutter

## Installation
To use the tftp package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and include the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  tftp: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/tftp).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to access the internet. Add the following lines within the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to configure your app's `Info.plist` to allow arbitrary loads if you are testing with non-secure connections. Add the following entry:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Using the TFTP Package
Once the package is installed and configured, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to create a TFTP client to send and receive files.

# Complete Example of Using the TFTP Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tftp/tftp.dart'; // Import the TFTP package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the main application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  TftpClient? _client; // Declare a TFTP client
  String _status = 'Ready'; // Status message

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _client = TftpClient('192.168.1.1'); // Initialize the TFTP client with server IP
  }

  // Function to send a file
  Future<void> _sendFile() async {
    setState(() {
      _status = 'Sending file...'; // Update status
    });
    try {
      // Attempt to send a file to the TFTP server
      await _client!.sendFile('path/to/local/file.txt', 'remote/file.txt');
      setState(() {
        _status = 'File sent successfully!'; // Update status on success
      });
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        _status = 'Error: $e'; // Update status on error
      });
    }
  }

  // Function to receive a file
  Future<void> _receiveFile() async {
    setState(() {
      _status = 'Receiving file...'; // Update status
    });
    try {
      // Attempt to receive a file from the TFTP server
      await _client!.receiveFile('remote/file.txt', 'path/to/local/file.txt');
      setState(() {
        _status = 'File received successfully!'; // Update status on success
      });
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        _status = 'Error: $e'; // Update status on error
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('TFTP Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              Text(_status), // Display the current status
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _sendFile, // Send file button
                child: Text('Send File'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _receiveFile, // Receive file button
                child: Text('Receive File'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application that utilizes the TFTP package to send and receive files.
// 
// 1. **Initialization**: The TFTP client is initialized with the server's IP address in the `initState` method.
// 2. **Sending a File**: The `_sendFile` method is called when the "Send File" button is pressed. It attempts to send a specified local file to the TFTP server and updates the status based on success or failure.
// 3. **Receiving a File**: The `_receiveFile` method is called when the "Receive File" button is pressed. It attempts to receive a file from the TFTP server and updates the status accordingly.
// 4. **User Interface**: The UI consists of a status text and two buttons for sending and receiving files, providing a simple interaction model for the user.
