# Getting Started with Fluttermoji

## Setup Process
To use the Fluttermoji package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add Dependency
Add the Fluttermoji package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  fluttermoji: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

### Step 2: Install Packages
Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
#### Android
Ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    compileSdkVersion 31  // or the latest version
    ...
}
```

#### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your `ios/Podfile` is set to use at least platform version 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

### Step 4: Import the Package
In your Dart file, import the Fluttermoji package:

```dart
import 'package:fluttermoji/fluttermoji.dart';
```

## Using Fluttermoji
To use Fluttermoji in your application, you can create a simple widget that allows users to customize their avatars. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fluttermoji/fluttermoji.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Fluttermoji Example')),
        body: FluttermojiCustomizer(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Additional Configuration
You can customize the appearance of the Fluttermoji widget by passing parameters to the `FluttermojiCustomizer` widget, such as `showSaveButton` to allow users to save their avatars.

# Complete Example of Fluttermoji

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fluttermoji/fluttermoji.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Fluttermoji Example')),
        body: FluttermojiCustomizer(
          showSaveButton: true, // Show the save button for users to save their avatars
          onSave: (String avatar) {
            // Callback when the avatar is saved
            print('Avatar saved: $avatar');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The AppBar displays the title 'Fluttermoji Example'.
// 4. The body contains the FluttermojiCustomizer widget, which allows users to customize their avatars.
// 5. The showSaveButton parameter is set to true, enabling users to save their avatars.
// 6. The onSave callback prints the saved avatar string to the console when the user saves their avatar.
```
