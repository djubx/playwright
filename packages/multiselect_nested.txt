<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Multiselect Nested Flutter Package

The `multiselect_nested` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to facilitate the creation of nested multi-select dropdowns in Flutter applications. This package is particularly useful when dealing with hierarchical data structures, allowing users to select multiple items from a nested list efficiently. 

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the `multiselect_nested` package in scenarios such as:

- **Category Selection**: When users need to select multiple categories from a hierarchical structure, such as selecting subcategories under a main category.
- **Tagging Systems**: In applications where users can tag items with multiple tags that may have sub-tags.
- **Complex Forms**: When building forms that require users to make selections from a nested list of options.

## Features

- **Nested Selection**: Supports multiple levels of selection, allowing users to drill down into categories.
- **Customizable UI**: Offers options to customize the appearance of the dropdowns and selected items.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate into existing Flutter applications with minimal setup.
- **State Management**: Built-in support for managing the state of selected items.

With these features, the `multiselect_nested` package enhances user experience by providing a clear and organized way to make selections from complex data structures.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Multiselect Nested

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `multiselect_nested` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  multiselect_nested: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a nested multi-select dropdown.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:multiselect_nested/multiselect_nested.dart';
```

2. Create a list of items to display in the dropdown:

```dart
final List<Map<String, dynamic>> items = [
  {
    'label': 'Fruits',
    'children': [
      {'label': 'Apple'},
      {'label': 'Banana'},
      {'label': 'Orange'},
    ],
  },
  {
    'label': 'Vegetables',
    'children': [
      {'label': 'Carrot'},
      {'label': 'Broccoli'},
      {'label': 'Spinach'},
    ],
  },
];
```

3. Use the `MultiSelectNested` widget in your UI:

```dart
MultiSelectNested(
  items: items,
  onConfirm: (selectedItems) {
    // Handle the selected items
    print(selectedItems);
  },
);
```

With these steps, you can easily integrate the `multiselect_nested` package into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Multiselect Nested

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:multiselect_nested/multiselect_nested.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Multiselect Nested Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Multiselect Nested Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: MultiSelectExample(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MultiSelectExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MultiSelectExampleState createState() => _MultiSelectExampleState();
}

class _MultiSelectExampleState extends State<MultiSelectExample> {
  // List to hold the selected items
  List<dynamic> selectedItems = [];

  // Sample data for the dropdown
  final List<Map<String, dynamic>> items = [
    {
      'label': 'Fruits',
      'children': [
        {'label': 'Apple'},
        {'label': 'Banana'},
        {'label': 'Orange'},
      ],
    },
    {
      'label': 'Vegetables',
      'children': [
        {'label': 'Carrot'},
        {'label': 'Broccoli'},
        {'label': 'Spinach'},
      ],
    },
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        // Display the selected items
        Text('Selected Items: ${selectedItems.join(', ')}'),
        SizedBox(height: 20),
        // MultiSelectNested widget
        MultiSelectNested(
          items: items,
          onConfirm: (selected) {
            // Update the state with selected items
            setState(() {
              selectedItems = selected;
            });
          },
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a centered MultiSelectExample widget.
// 3. MultiSelectExample is a stateful widget that maintains a list of selected items.
// 4. The build method displays the selected items and the MultiSelectNested widget.
// 5. When the user confirms their selection, the onConfirm callback updates the selectedItems state, which triggers a rebuild to display the updated selection.
```

In this blog, we explored the `multiselect_nested` Flutter package, detailing its features, setup process, and providing a complete example. The application flow is straightforward: it initializes the app, displays a multi-select dropdown, and updates the UI based on user selections. This package is a valuable addition for developers looking to implement nested multi-select functionality in their Flutter applications.
