# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the GalleryImage Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the GalleryImage package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  galleryimage: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install Packages
Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add permissions for accessing the photo library. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your photo library.</string>
```

## Step 4: Import the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:galleryimage/galleryimage.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the GalleryImage Widget
You can now use the `GalleryImage` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
GalleryImage(
  images: [
    'https://example.com/image1.jpg',
    'https://example.com/image2.jpg',
    'https://example.com/image3.jpg',
  ],
  // Additional customization options can be added here
);
```

This will create a basic image gallery that displays the specified images.

# Complete Example of Using the GalleryImage Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:galleryimage/galleryimage.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Gallery Image Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: GalleryScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class GalleryScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Image Gallery'),
      ),
      body: GalleryImage(
        images: [
          'https://example.com/image1.jpg',
          'https://example.com/image2.jpg',
          'https://example.com/image3.jpg',
          // Add more image URLs as needed
        ],
        // You can customize the layout and behavior here
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to GalleryScreen, which is another StatelessWidget.
// 4. GalleryScreen builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body that contains the GalleryImage widget.
// 5. The GalleryImage widget takes a list of image URLs and displays them in a gallery format.
// 6. Users can interact with the images, zooming and panning as needed, providing a rich user experience.
```
