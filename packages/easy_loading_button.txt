<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Easy Loading Button Flutter Package

The **easy_loading_button** Flutter package is a simple yet powerful tool designed to enhance user experience by providing a customizable loading button. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where a user action triggers a process that takes time, such as submitting a form or making a network request. Instead of leaving users in the dark, the loading button visually indicates that an action is in progress, improving the overall usability of the application.

## When to Use This Package

- **Form Submissions**: When users submit forms, the loading button can indicate that the submission is being processed.
- **Network Requests**: For actions that involve fetching data from an API, the loading button can show that the request is in progress.
- **Long-Running Tasks**: Any action that takes a noticeable amount of time can benefit from a loading button to keep users informed.

## Features

- **Customizable Appearance**: You can easily customize the button's appearance, including colors, text, and loading indicators.
- **Flexible States**: The button can switch between normal, loading, and disabled states seamlessly.
- **Easy Integration**: The package is designed to be easy to integrate into existing Flutter applications with minimal setup.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Easy Loading Button

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `easy_loading_button` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  easy_loading_button: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:easy_loading_button/easy_loading_button.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

You can use the `EasyLoadingButton` widget in your Flutter application as follows:

```dart
EasyLoadingButton(
  onPressed: () async {
    // Start loading
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2)); // Simulate a network call
    // Stop loading
  },
  child: Text('Submit'),
);
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Customizing the Button

You can customize the button's appearance by using various properties:

```dart
EasyLoadingButton(
  onPressed: () async {
    // Start loading
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2)); // Simulate a network call
    // Stop loading
  },
  child: Text('Submit'),
  loadingText: Text('Loading...'),
  color: Colors.blue,
  loadingColor: Colors.green,
);
```

This customization allows you to change the button's text, colors, and more to fit your app's design.

# Complete Example of Easy Loading Button

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:easy_loading_button/easy_loading_button.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Easy Loading Button Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Easy Loading Button Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
            child: EasyLoadingButton(
              onPressed: () async {
                // Start loading state
                // This simulates a network call or a long-running task
                await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));
                // After the delay, the loading state will stop automatically
              },
              child: Text('Submit'),
              loadingText: Text('Loading...'),
              color: Colors.blue,
              loadingColor: Colors.green,
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Easy Loading Button Demo".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers a Padding widget that contains the EasyLoadingButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, it enters a loading state for 2 seconds, simulating a network call.
// 6. After the delay, the button automatically returns to its normal state, indicating the action is complete.
```
