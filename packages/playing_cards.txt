# Complete Example of Using the Playing Cards Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:playing_cards/playing_cards.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Playing Cards Example',
      home: PlayingCardsHome(),
    );
  }
}

class PlayingCardsHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PlayingCardsHomeState createState() => _PlayingCardsHomeState();
}

class _PlayingCardsHomeState extends State<PlayingCardsHome> {
  // Create a deck of cards
  final Deck deck = Deck();

  // Variable to hold the top card
  Card? topCard;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Shuffle the deck and draw the top card
    deck.shuffle();
    topCard = deck.draw();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Playing Cards Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the top card
            if (topCard != null)
              PlayingCardWidget(card: topCard!),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Draw a new card when the button is pressed
                setState(() {
                  topCard = deck.draw();
                });
              },
              child: Text('Draw a New Card'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget (PlayingCardsHome).
// 3. In PlayingCardsHome, a Deck of cards is created and shuffled in the initState method.
// 4. The top card is drawn from the deck and displayed using the PlayingCardWidget.
// 5. When the "Draw a New Card" button is pressed, a new card is drawn from the deck and displayed.
// 6. The UI updates to show the new top card without restarting the app.
```
