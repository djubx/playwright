# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the stripe_android Package

## Step 1: Adding the Package to Your Project
To get started, add the `stripe_android` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  stripe_android: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Add the following permissions and metadata to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<manifest>
    <application>
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.stripe.apiKey"
            android:value="YOUR_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY" />
    </application>
</manifest>
```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure that your `android/build.gradle` file includes the necessary dependencies:

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.stripe:stripe-android:latest_version'
}
```

### iOS Configuration
While this package is primarily for Android, ensure that your iOS project is set up correctly if you plan to support both platforms. You may need to add the Stripe SDK for iOS as well.

## Step 3: Using the Package
To use the `stripe_android` package, you will typically follow these steps in your Flutter application:

1. **Initialize Stripe**: Call the initialization method with your publishable key.
2. **Create Payment Method**: Use the provided methods to create a payment method.
3. **Handle Payment Confirmation**: Confirm the payment and handle the response.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement these steps in your Flutter app:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:stripe_android/stripe_android.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Stripe Payment Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initialize Stripe with your publishable key
              Stripe.init('YOUR_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY');

              // Create a payment method
              final paymentMethod = await Stripe.createPaymentMethod(
                PaymentMethodParams.card(
                  CardFieldParams(
                    // Card details will be collected here
                  ),
                ),
              );

              // Handle payment confirmation
              // (You would typically send this to your backend for processing)
              print('Payment Method Created: ${paymentMethod.id}');
            },
            child: Text('Pay Now'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code initializes Stripe, creates a payment method, and prints the payment method ID to the console.

                PaymentMethodParams.card(
                  CardFieldParams(
                    // Here you would collect card details
                  ),
                ),
              );

              // Step 3: Handle payment confirmation
              // (You would typically send this to your backend for processing)
              print('Payment Method Created: ${paymentMethod.id}');
            },
            child: Text('Pay Now'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with a MaterialApp widget that contains a Scaffold.
// 2. An AppBar is created with the title 'Stripe Payment Example'.
// 3. In the body of the Scaffold, a Center widget is used to center the content.
// 4. An ElevatedButton is displayed with the text 'Pay Now'.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the Stripe SDK is initialized with the publishable key.
// 6. A payment method is created using the card details collected from the user.
// 7. Finally, the payment method ID is printed to the console, which can be sent to your backend for further processing.
