Here's a detailed technical blog on the "strava_client" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Strava Client Flutter Package

The `strava_client` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed for developers looking to integrate Strava's API into their Flutter applications. Strava is a popular platform for tracking athletic activities, and this package allows developers to access Strava's extensive features, such as retrieving user activities, uploading new activities, and managing user profiles.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `strava_client` package when:
- You are developing a fitness application that requires integration with Strava.
- You want to display user activities, statistics, or leaderboards from Strava.
- You need to allow users to upload their activities directly to Strava from your app.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Simplifies the OAuth2 authentication process to connect with Strava.
- **Activity Management**: Retrieve, create, and update activities seamlessly.
- **User Profile Access**: Fetch user profile information and statistics.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in error handling for API requests.

With these features, the `strava_client` package provides a comprehensive solution for integrating Strava's capabilities into your Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up the Strava Client Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `strava_client` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `strava_client` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  strava_client: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Configure OAuth2 Authentication

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        manifestPlaceholders = [appAuthRedirectScheme: 'your.package.name']
    }
}
```

Replace `your.package.name` with your actual package name.

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following:

```xml
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
    <dict>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
        <array>
            <string>your.package.name</string>
        </array>
    </dict>
</array>
```

Replace `your.package.name` with your actual package name.

## Step 3: Initialize the Strava Client

In your main Dart file, initialize the Strava client with your client ID and client secret:

```dart
import 'package:strava_client/strava_client.dart';

class RealFlutter {
  final StravaClient client;

  RealFlutter(this.client);
}
```

## Step 4: Implement Authentication

Use the following code to authenticate users:

```dart
void authenticate() async {
  final result = await client.authenticate();
  if (result != null) {
    // User is authenticated
  } else {
    // Handle authentication error
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Fetch User Activities

Once authenticated, you can fetch user activities:

```dart
void fetchActivities() async {
  final activities = await client.getActivities();
  // Process activities
}
```

## Conclusion

You have now set up the `strava_client` package in your Flutter application. You can authenticate users and fetch their activities from Strava. In the next section, we will provide a complete example demonstrating these features in action.

# Complete Example of Using the Strava Client Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:strava_client/strava_client.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Strava Client Example',
      home: StravaHome(),
    );
  }
}

class StravaHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _StravaHomeState createState() => _StravaHomeState();
}

class _StravaHomeState extends State<StravaHome> {
  late StravaClient client; // Declare the Strava client
  List<Activity> activities = []; // List to hold user activities

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    client = StravaClient(clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID', clientSecret: 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET'); // Initialize the client
    authenticate(); // Start the authentication process
  }

  // Function to authenticate the user
  void authenticate() async {
    final result = await client.authenticate(); // Call the authenticate method
    if (result != null) {
      fetchActivities(); // Fetch activities if authentication is successful
    } else {
      // Handle authentication error
      print('Authentication failed');
    }
  }

  // Function to fetch user activities
  void fetchActivities() async {
    final fetchedActivities = await client.getActivities(); // Get activities from Strava
    setState(() {
      activities = fetchedActivities; // Update the state with fetched activities
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Strava Activities'),
      ),
      body: activities.isEmpty
          ? Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator()) // Show loading indicator if no activities
          : ListView.builder(
              itemCount: activities.length,
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                final activity = activities[index];
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text(activity.name), // Display activity name
                  subtitle: Text('Distance: ${activity.distance} km'), // Display activity distance
                );
              },
            ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and home set to StravaHome.
// 3. In StravaHome, the StravaClient is initialized with client ID and secret.
// 4. The authenticate method is called in initState to start the OAuth2 process.
// 5. If authentication is successful, fetchActivities is called to retrieve user activities.
// 6. The activities are displayed in a ListView, showing the name and distance of each activity.
```
