# PubNub Flutter Package: Real-time Communication Made Easy

The **PubNub** Flutter package is a powerful tool for developers looking to implement real-time communication features in their applications. PubNub provides a global data stream network that allows for instant messaging, notifications, and data synchronization across devices. This package is particularly useful for applications that require real-time updates, such as chat applications, collaborative tools, and live data feeds.

## When to Use PubNub
- **Chat Applications**: Build real-time messaging features with ease.
- **Live Updates**: Implement features that require instant updates, such as notifications or live scores.
- **Collaborative Tools**: Create applications where multiple users can interact in real-time.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Messaging**: Send and receive messages instantly.
- **Presence Detection**: Track user presence and activity.
- **Data Streams**: Publish and subscribe to channels for data synchronization.
- **Storage and Playback**: Store messages for later retrieval and playback.
- **Security**: Built-in security features to protect data in transit.

With these features, the PubNub Flutter package is an excellent choice for developers looking to enhance their applications with real-time capabilities.

# Setting Up the PubNub Flutter Package

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the PubNub Flutter package, including platform-specific configurations for both Android and iOS.

## Installation

To add the PubNub package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  pubnub: ^4.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run the following command to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:
   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. Ensure you have the latest version of Xcode and the iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0.

## Basic Usage

To use the PubNub package, you need to initialize it with your PubNub publish and subscribe keys. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set it up:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pubnub/pubnub.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late PubNub pubnub;
  late String channel = 'demo_channel';
  late String message = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize PubNub with your publish and subscribe keys
    pubnub = PubNub(
      publishKey: 'your-publish-key',
      subscribeKey: 'your-subscribe-key',
    );

    // Subscribe to the channel
    pubnub.subscribe(channels: [channel]);
    pubnub.onMessage.listen((message) {
      // Handle incoming messages
      setState(() {
        this.message = message.message;
      });
    });
  }

  // Function to send a message
  void sendMessage(String msg) {
    pubnub.publish(channel: channel, message: msg);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('PubNub Example')),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          Text('Received Message: $message'),
          TextField(
            onSubmitted: (value) {
              sendMessage(value);
            },
            decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Send a message'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code initializes the PubNub client, subscribes to a channel, and listens for incoming messages. Users can send messages through a text field.

# Complete Example of PubNub in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pubnub/pubnub.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late PubNub pubnub; // Declare a PubNub instance
  late String channel = 'demo_channel'; // Define the channel name
  late String message = ''; // Variable to hold the received message

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize PubNub with your publish and subscribe keys
    pubnub = PubNub(
      publishKey: 'your-publish-key', // Replace with your publish key
      subscribeKey: 'your-subscribe-key', // Replace with your subscribe key
    );

    // Subscribe to the channel
    pubnub.subscribe(channels: [channel]);
    // Listen for incoming messages
    pubnub.onMessage.listen((message) {
      // Update the state with the received message
      setState(() {
        this.message = message.message; // Store the message
      });
    });
  }

  // Function to send a message
  void sendMessage(String msg) {
    pubnub.publish(channel: channel, message: msg); // Publish the message to the channel
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('PubNub Example')), // App bar title
      body: Column(
        children: [
          Text('Received Message: $message'), // Display the received message
          TextField(
            onSubmitted: (value) {
              sendMessage(value); // Send the message when submitted
            },
            decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Send a message'), // Input field decoration
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app initializes the PubNub instance with the provided publish and subscribe keys.
// 2. It subscribes to a channel named 'demo_channel'.
// 3. The app listens for incoming messages on that channel.
// 4. When a message is received, it updates the state to display the message.
// 5. Users can type a message in the text field and submit it, which triggers the sendMessage function.
// 6. The sendMessage function publishes the message to the channel, making it available to all subscribers.
```
