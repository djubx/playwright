# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using docx_template

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `docx_template` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  docx_template: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/docx_template).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you plan to access files from the device storage. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save documents.</string>
<key>NSDocumentsUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your documents to save files.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to create a DOCX file from a template.

# Complete Example: Generating a DOCX File

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:docx_template/docx_template.dart';
import 'dart:io';
import 'package:path_provider/path_provider.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'DOCX Template Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('DOCX Template Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Call the function to generate the DOCX file
              await generateDocx();
            },
            child: Text('Generate DOCX'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  Future<void> generateDocx() async {
    // Load the DOCX template from assets
    final ByteData bytes = await rootBundle.load('assets/template.docx');
    final List<int> list = bytes.buffer.asUint8List();

    // Create a Document instance from the template
    final docxTemplate = DocxTemplate(list);

    // Prepare the data to be inserted into the template
    final Map<String, dynamic> values = {
      'title': 'Invoice',
      'date': DateTime.now().toString(),
      'amount': 100.0,
    };

    // Render the document with the provided values
    final output = await docxTemplate.generate(values);

    // Get the directory to save the file
    final directory = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
    final file = File('${directory.path}/invoice.docx');

    // Write the output to the file
    await file.writeAsBytes(output);

    // Notify the user that the file has been created
    print('Document created at: ${file.path}');
  }
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation

// The application starts by running the RealFlutter widget.
// The main widget is a MaterialApp with a simple UI containing a button.
// When the button is pressed, it triggers the generateDocx function.
// Inside generateDocx, the DOCX template is loaded from the assets.
// A DocxTemplate instance is created using the loaded template.
// A map of values is prepared to replace placeholders in the template.
// The document is generated with the provided values.
// The application retrieves the device's document directory to save the file.
// The generated DOCX file is written to the specified path.
// Finally, a message is printed to the console indicating the file's location.
