# Tutorial

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `persona_flutter` package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `persona_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  persona_flutter: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # Ensure this is set to at least 10.0
```

## Step 4: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create and manage user personas.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:persona_flutter/persona_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Persona Flutter Demo',
      home: PersonaHome(),
    );
  }
}

class PersonaHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PersonaHomeState createState() => _PersonaHomeState();
}

class _PersonaHomeState extends State<PersonaHome> {
  // Initialize the PersonaManager
  final PersonaManager personaManager = PersonaManager();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Create a new persona
    personaManager.createPersona('User1', {'age': 25, 'interests': ['sports', 'music']});
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Persona Management'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Current Persona: ${personaManager.getCurrentPersona().name}'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that initializes a `PersonaManager` and creates a new persona upon starting the app.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:persona_flutter/persona_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// Main application widget
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Persona Flutter Demo',
      home: PersonaHome(),
    );
  }
}

// Home widget for managing personas
class PersonaHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PersonaHomeState createState() => _PersonaHomeState();
}

class _PersonaHomeState extends State<PersonaHome> {
  // Initialize the PersonaManager
  final PersonaManager personaManager = PersonaManager();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Create a new persona with specific attributes
    personaManager.createPersona('User1', {'age': 25, 'interests': ['sports', 'music']});
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Persona Management'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        // Display the current persona's name
        child: Text('Current Persona: ${personaManager.getCurrentPersona().name}'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets PersonaHome as the home widget.
// 3. PersonaHome is a StatefulWidget that manages the user persona.
// 4. In the initState method, we create a new persona named 'User1' with specific attributes.
// 5. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget displaying the current persona's name.
// 6. The application dynamically shows the name of the current persona, demonstrating the basic functionality of the persona management system.
```
