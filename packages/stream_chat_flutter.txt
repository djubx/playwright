# Tutorial: Setting Up Stream Chat in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `stream_chat_flutter` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependencies

First, add the `stream_chat_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  stream_chat_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/stream_chat_flutter).

## Step 2: Configure for Android

For Android, ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

Also, make sure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Configure for iOS

For iOS, you need to add the following permissions in your `Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Initialize the Stream Chat Client

In your main Dart file, initialize the Stream Chat client with your API key:

```dart
import 'package:stream_chat_flutter/stream_chat_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  final client = StreamChatClient('YOUR_API_KEY');
  runApp(MyApp(client: client));
}
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual Stream API key.

## Step 5: Create a Chat Interface

You can now create a chat interface using the provided widgets. Here’s a simple example:

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  final StreamChatClient client;

  MyApp({required this.client});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return StreamChat(
      client: client,
      child: MaterialApp(
        home: ChannelListScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This sets up a basic chat application with a channel list screen.

## Step 6: Run Your Application

Now you can run your application on both Android and iOS devices. Make sure to test the chat functionality to ensure everything is working as expected.

With these steps, you have successfully set up the `stream_chat_flutter` package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Stream Chat Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:stream_chat_flutter/stream_chat_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the Stream Chat client with your API key
  final client = StreamChatClient('YOUR_API_KEY');

  runApp(MyApp(client: client));
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  final StreamChatClient client;

  MyApp({required this.client});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return StreamChat(
      client: client,
      child: MaterialApp(
        title: 'Stream Chat Example',
        theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
        home: ChannelListScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class ChannelListScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Build the channel list screen
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Channels')),
      body: ChannelListView(
        onChannelTap: (channel) {
          // Navigate to the chat screen when a channel is tapped
          Navigator.push(
            context,
            MaterialPageRoute(
              builder: (context) => ChatScreen(channel: channel),
            ),
          );
        },
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          // Create a new channel when the button is pressed
          // (Implementation not shown)
        },
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class ChatScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final Channel channel;

  ChatScreen({required this.channel});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Build the chat screen for the selected channel
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text(channel.name)),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          Expanded(
            child: MessageListView(channel: channel),
          ),
          MessageInput(channel: channel),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts by initializing the Stream Chat client with the API key.
// 2. The MyApp widget sets up the StreamChat provider and the main MaterialApp.
// 3. The ChannelListScreen displays a list of channels.
// 4. When a channel is tapped, it navigates to the ChatScreen for that channel.
// 5. The ChatScreen displays messages and an input field for sending new messages.
```

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The app initializes the Stream Chat client with the provided API key.
// 2. The `MyApp` widget wraps the application in a `StreamChat` provider, allowing access to chat functionalities.
// 3. The `ChannelListScreen` displays a list of available channels using `ChannelListView`.
// 4. When a user taps on a channel, it navigates to the `ChatScreen`, passing the selected channel as an argument.
// 5. The `ChatScreen` displays the messages in the channel using `MessageListView` and provides an input field for sending new messages with `MessageInput`.
// 6. The floating action button in the `ChannelListScreen` can be used to create new channels (implementation not shown).
// This structure allows for a clean and efficient chat experience in your Flutter application.
