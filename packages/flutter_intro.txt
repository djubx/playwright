<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Flutter Package: flutter_intro

## Description

The `flutter_intro` package is a powerful tool designed to help developers create engaging onboarding experiences for their Flutter applications. It provides a simple way to introduce users to the app's features through a series of interactive screens. This package is particularly useful for applications that have complex functionalities or require user guidance to enhance usability.

### When to Use

You should consider using the `flutter_intro` package when:
- You are launching a new app and want to guide users through its features.
- Your app has multiple functionalities that may not be immediately clear to new users.
- You want to improve user retention by providing a clear introduction to your app.

### Features

- **Customizable Screens**: Create onboarding screens with custom text, images, and buttons.
- **Skip and Next Buttons**: Allow users to navigate through the onboarding process at their own pace.
- **Page Indicators**: Visual indicators to show users their progress through the onboarding process.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup and integration into existing Flutter applications.

## Tutorial

### Setup Process

To get started with the `flutter_intro` package, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `flutter_intro` package under dependencies.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     flutter_intro: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21.

     ```groovy
     android {
         ...
         defaultConfig {
             ...
             minSdkVersion 21
         }
     }
     ```

   - **iOS**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and ensure you have the necessary permissions if your onboarding includes features that require them (like camera access).

### Using the Package

1. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the `flutter_intro` package.

   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter_intro/flutter_intro.dart';
   ```

2. **Create the Onboarding Screens**: Use the `Intro` widget to create your onboarding experience. You can customize each screen with text, images, and buttons.

3. **Integrate into Your App**: Call the onboarding screens in your main application file, typically in the `initState` method of your main widget.

### Example Configuration

Here’s a simple example of how to set up the onboarding screens:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_intro/flutter_intro.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: IntroScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class IntroScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Intro(
      pages: [
        IntroPage(
          title: 'Welcome to MyApp',
          description: 'This is a brief introduction to our app.',
          image: AssetImage('assets/welcome.png'),
        ),
        IntroPage(
          title: 'Feature 1',
          description: 'Learn about the first feature of our app.',
          image: AssetImage('assets/feature1.png'),
        ),
        // Add more pages as needed
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

## Complete Example

Here’s a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates all key features of the `flutter_intro` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_intro/flutter_intro.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Intro Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: IntroScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class IntroScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Intro(
      pages: [
        // First onboarding page
        IntroPage(
          title: 'Welcome to MyApp',
          description: 'This is a brief introduction to our app.',
          image: AssetImage('assets/welcome.png'),
        ),
        // Second onboarding page
        IntroPage(
          title: 'Feature 1',
          description: 'Learn about the first feature of our app.',
          image: AssetImage('assets/feature1.png'),
        ),
        // Third onboarding page
        IntroPage(
          title: 'Feature 2',
          description: 'Discover the second feature of our app.',
          image: AssetImage('assets/feature2.png'),
        ),
      ],
      onDone: () {
        // Navigate to the main application screen after onboarding
        Navigator.of(context).pushReplacement(
          MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => MainAppScreen()),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

// Main application screen after onboarding
class MainAppScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Main Application'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to the main application!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

/*
  Application Flow Explanation:
  1. The app starts with the MyApp class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
  2. The home property of MaterialApp is set to IntroScreen, which displays the onboarding screens.
  3. The Intro widget takes a list of IntroPage widgets, each representing a screen in the onboarding process.
  4. Each IntroPage has a title, description, and an image.
  5. When the user completes the onboarding process, the onDone callback is triggered.
  6. This callback navigates the user to the MainAppScreen, which is the main application interface.
  7. The MainAppScreen displays a simple welcome message, indicating that the user has successfully completed the onboarding.
