# Animated Loading Indicators Flutter Package

The `animated_loading_indicators` package is a versatile Flutter library designed to provide a variety of animated loading indicators. These indicators can enhance the user experience by visually communicating that a process is ongoing, such as data fetching or processing. This package is particularly useful in applications where loading times may vary, and users need feedback to understand that their request is being processed.

## When to Use This Package
- **Data Fetching**: When your app fetches data from an API and you want to show users that the data is being loaded.
- **Form Submissions**: To indicate that a form submission is in progress.
- **Background Processing**: When performing tasks that may take time, such as image processing or file uploads.

## Features
- **Multiple Loading Styles**: Offers a variety of loading indicators, including circular, linear, and custom animations.
- **Customizable**: Allows customization of colors, sizes, and animation durations to fit your app's theme.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate into existing Flutter applications with minimal setup.

Overall, the `animated_loading_indicators` package is a great choice for developers looking to improve the user experience during loading states in their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Animated Loading Indicators

## Installation
To use the `animated_loading_indicators` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  animated_loading_indicators: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Usage
### Basic Setup
To use the loading indicators, you need to import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:animated_loading_indicators/animated_loading_indicators.dart';
```

### Platform-Specific Details
- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid compatibility issues.
- **iOS**: No additional configuration is required for iOS, but ensure you have the latest version of Xcode for optimal performance.

### Example Usage
You can use the loading indicators in your widget tree as follows:

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Center(
    child: AnimatedLoadingIndicator(
      indicatorType: IndicatorType.circle, // Choose your indicator type
      color: Colors.blue, // Customize the color
      size: 50.0, // Set the size of the indicator
    ),
  );
}
```

This will display a circular loading indicator in the center of your screen. You can easily switch between different types of indicators by changing the `indicatorType` property.

# Complete Example of Animated Loading Indicators

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_loading_indicators/animated_loading_indicators.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animated Loading Indicators Example',
      home: LoadingIndicatorDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class LoadingIndicatorDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _LoadingIndicatorDemoState createState() => _LoadingIndicatorDemoState();
}

class _LoadingIndicatorDemoState extends State<LoadingIndicatorDemo> {
  bool _isLoading = false; // State variable to track loading status

  // Function to simulate a network call
  Future<void> _fetchData() async {
    setState(() {
      _isLoading = true; // Set loading to true when fetching data
    });

    // Simulate a network delay
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3));

    setState(() {
      _isLoading = false; // Set loading to false after data is fetched
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Loading Indicator Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: _isLoading
            ? AnimatedLoadingIndicator(
                indicatorType: IndicatorType.circle, // Circular loading indicator
                color: Colors.blue, // Customize the color
                size: 50.0, // Set the size of the indicator
              )
            : ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _fetchData, // Trigger data fetching
                child: Text('Fetch Data'),
              ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget (LoadingIndicatorDemo).
// 3. LoadingIndicatorDemo is a stateful widget that manages the loading state.
// 4. When the user presses the 'Fetch Data' button, the _fetchData function is called.
// 5. _fetchData sets the loading state to true, triggering the loading indicator to display.
// 6. After a simulated delay of 3 seconds, the loading state is set back to false, hiding the indicator and showing the button again.
```
