# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Flame Splash Screen Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **flame_splash_screen** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **flame_splash_screen** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flame_splash_screen: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Configuring for Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file is properly configured. You may want to set the theme for your splash screen. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following inside the `<application>` tag:

```xml
<activity
    android:name=".MainActivity"
    android:theme="@style/LaunchTheme">
    ...
</activity>
```

You can define `LaunchTheme` in your `styles.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/res/values/styles.xml`:

```xml
<resources>
    <style name="LaunchTheme" parent="Theme.AppCompat.NoActionBar">
        <item name="android:windowBackground">@drawable/splash</item>
    </style>
</resources>
```

Make sure to create a drawable resource for your splash screen image.

## Step 3: Configuring for iOS

For iOS, you need to set the launch screen in your `Info.plist` file. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>UILaunchStoryboardName</key>
<string>LaunchScreen</string>
```

You can customize the `LaunchScreen.storyboard` file located in `ios/Runner` to include your splash screen design.

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is an example of how to implement the splash screen in your app.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flame_splash_screen/flame_splash_screen.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flame Splash Screen Example',
      home: SplashScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class SplashScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return FlameSplashScreen(
      // Set the duration for the splash screen
      duration: 3000, // 3 seconds
      // Define the background color
      backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
      // Add an image or logo
      image: Image.asset('assets/logo.png'), // Ensure the image is in your assets
      // Define the next screen after the splash
      next: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to the Home Screen!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets the home to SplashScreen.
// 3. The SplashScreen widget uses FlameSplashScreen to display a splash screen for 3 seconds.
// 4. The splash screen has a blue background and displays an image (logo) from the assets.
// 5. After the duration, the app navigates to the HomeScreen, which displays a welcome message.
