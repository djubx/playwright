# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_tabbar_page

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_tabbar_page` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_tabbar_page` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_tabbar_page: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Basic Setup

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple application that demonstrates how to use the `flutter_tabbar_page` package.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_tabbar_page/flutter_tabbar_page.dart';
```

2. Create a new class `RealFlutter` that extends `StatelessWidget` or `StatefulWidget` depending on your needs.

3. Implement the `TabBarPage` widget in your `build` method.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set it up:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: TabBarPage(
        tabs: [
          Tab(text: 'Home'),
          Tab(text: 'Settings'),
          Tab(text: 'Profile'),
        ],
        pages: [
          HomePage(),
          SettingsPage(),
          ProfilePage(),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

4. Create the individual pages (e.g., `HomePage`, `SettingsPage`, `ProfilePage`) that will be displayed when each tab is selected.

That's it! You now have a basic setup for using the `flutter_tabbar_page` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of flutter_tabbar_page

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_tabbar_page/flutter_tabbar_page.dart';

// Main entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// The main application class
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter TabBar Example',
      home: TabBarPage(
        // Define the tabs
        tabs: [
          Tab(text: 'Home'), // First tab
          Tab(text: 'Settings'), // Second tab
          Tab(text: 'Profile'), // Third tab
        ],
        // Define the pages corresponding to each tab
        pages: [
          HomePage(), // Page for the Home tab
          SettingsPage(), // Page for the Settings tab
          ProfilePage(), // Page for the Profile tab
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Home page widget
class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Welcome to the Home Page!')),
    );
  }
}

// Settings page widget
class SettingsPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Settings')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Adjust your settings here.')),
    );
  }
}

// Profile page widget
class ProfilePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Profile')),
      body: Center(child: Text('This is your profile.')),
    );
  }
}

// Application flow explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a TabBarPage.
// 3. The TabBarPage contains three tabs: Home, Settings, and Profile.
// 4. Each tab corresponds to a different page (HomePage, SettingsPage, ProfilePage).
// 5. When a tab is selected, the corresponding page is displayed.
// 6. Each page has its own AppBar and content, providing a clear structure for navigation.
