# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the `text_marquee` Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the `text_marquee` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  text_marquee: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Package
Now that the package is installed, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the `text_marquee` widget.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:text_marquee/text_marquee.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Text Marquee Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: TextMarquee(
            text: Text('Welcome to the Flutter Text Marquee Package!'),
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
            scrollAxis: Axis.horizontal,
            speed: 50, // Speed of the scrolling text
            pauseAfterRound: Duration(seconds: 1), // Pause after each round
            numberOfRounds: 2, // Number of times to scroll
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that displays a scrolling text message in the center of the screen. You can customize the text, speed, and other properties as needed.

# Complete Example of the `text_marquee` Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:text_marquee/text_marquee.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Text Marquee Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Center widget to align the marquee in the middle of the screen
          child: TextMarquee(
            text: Text('Welcome to the Flutter Text Marquee Package!'),
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
            scrollAxis: Axis.horizontal, // Set the scrolling direction
            speed: 50, // Speed of the scrolling text
            pauseAfterRound: Duration(seconds: 1), // Pause after each round
            numberOfRounds: 2, // Number of times to scroll
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The runApp function initializes the app and displays the RealFlutter widget.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 4. The AppBar displays the title of the app.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 6. Inside the Center widget, the TextMarquee widget is used to display scrolling text.
// 7. The TextMarquee widget takes several parameters:
//    - text: The text to be displayed.
//    - style: The style of the text, including font size and weight.
//    - scrollAxis: The direction of scrolling (horizontal in this case).
//    - speed: The speed at which the text scrolls across the screen.
//    - pauseAfterRound: Duration to pause after each complete scroll.
//    - numberOfRounds: How many times the text should scroll before stopping.
```
