# flutter_spinner_picker: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the `flutter_spinner_picker` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_spinner_picker: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the spinner picker in your Flutter application, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_spinner_picker/flutter_spinner_picker.dart';
```

2. Create a simple widget that utilizes the spinner picker:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Spinner Picker Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: SpinnerPicker(
          items: ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3'],
          onChanged: (value) {
            // Handle the selected value
            print('Selected: $value');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic spinner picker that allows users to select from three options. The selected value is printed to the console.

With this setup, you are ready to use the `flutter_spinner_picker` package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of flutter_spinner_picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_spinner_picker/flutter_spinner_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Spinner Picker Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String selectedValue = 'Option 1'; // Default selected value

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Spinner Picker Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the currently selected value
            Text(
              'Selected: $selectedValue',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Spinner Picker widget
            SpinnerPicker(
              items: ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3'],
              onChanged: (value) {
                // Update the selected value when the user picks an option
                setState(() {
                  selectedValue = value; // Update state with the new value
                });
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The MyApp widget builds the home screen using the RealFlutter widget.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget maintains the state of the selected value.
// 4. The SpinnerPicker widget displays a list of options for the user to select.
// 5. When the user selects an option, the onChanged callback updates the selectedValue state.
// 6. The UI is rebuilt to reflect the newly selected value, which is displayed on the screen.
