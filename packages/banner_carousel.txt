Setup and Configuration
-----------------------

To use the `banner_carousel` package in your Flutter app, follow these steps:

1.  Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

    ```yml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  banner_carousel: ^1.0.0
```

2.  Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.
3.  Import the package in your Dart file:

    ```dart
import 'package:banner_carousel/banner_carousel.dart';
```

Basic Usage
------------

To create a basic banner carousel, use the `BannerCarousel` widget and provide a list of `BannerItem` objects:

```dart
BannerCarousel(
  items: [
    BannerItem(
      image: AssetImage('assets/image1.jpg'),
      title: 'Image 1',
      subtitle: 'Subtitle 1',
    ),
    BannerItem(
      image: AssetImage('assets/image2.jpg'),
      title: 'Image 2',
      subtitle: 'Subtitle 2',
    ),
  ],
)
```

Customization
-------------

The `BannerCarousel` widget provides several properties for customizing the appearance and behavior of the carousel. For example, you can change the animation duration, pagination style, and navigation controls:

```dart
BannerCarousel(
  items: [
    // ...
  ],
  animationDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 500),
  paginationStyle: PaginationStyle.roundedRect,
  navigationControls: NavigationControls(
    prevIcon: Icon(Icons.arrow_back),
    nextIcon: Icon(Icons.arrow_forward),
  ),
)
```

Platform-Specific Details
-------------------------

The `banner_carousel` package works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms. However, you may need to configure some platform-specific settings to optimize the performance and appearance of the carousel.

For example, on Android, you can use the `android:hardwareAccelerated` property in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file to enable hardware acceleration for the carousel:

```xml
<application
  android:hardwareAccelerated="true"
  // ...
>
```

On iOS, you can use the `ios:optimizeRendering` property in your `Info.plist` file to optimize the rendering performance of the carousel:

```xml
<key>ios.optimizeRendering</key>
<true/>
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:banner_carousel/banner_carousel.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Banner Carousel Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Banner Carousel Demo'),
        ),
        body: BannerCarousel(
          items: [
            BannerItem(
              image: AssetImage('assets/image1.jpg'),
              title: 'Image 1',
              subtitle: 'Subtitle 1',
            ),
            BannerItem(
              image: AssetImage('assets/image2.jpg'),
              title: 'Image 2',
              subtitle: 'Subtitle 2',
            ),
            BannerItem(
              image: AssetImage('assets/image3.jpg'),
              title: 'Image 3',
              subtitle: 'Subtitle 3',
            ),
          ],
          animationDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 500),
          paginationStyle: PaginationStyle.roundedRect,
          navigationControls: NavigationControls(
            prevIcon: Icon(Icons.arrow_back),
            nextIcon: Icon(Icons.arrow_forward),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app, and the `RealFlutter` widget is rendered.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` widget builds a `MaterialApp` with a `Scaffold` containing an `AppBar` and a `BannerCarousel`.
// 3. The `BannerCarousel` widget is initialized with a list of `BannerItem` objects, each containing an image, title, and subtitle.
// 4. The `BannerCarousel` widget displays the first `BannerItem` in the list, with navigation controls and pagination.
// 5. The user can navigate through the `BannerItem` objects using the navigation controls, and the `BannerCarousel` widget will animate the transition between each item.
// 6. The `BannerCarousel` widget will also display the pagination indicators, allowing the user to see which item is currently being displayed.
```

// In summary, the code flows as follows:
// The user runs the app -> The `RealFlutter` widget is rendered -> The `BannerCarousel` widget is initialized -> The user navigates through the `BannerItem` objects -> The `BannerCarousel` widget animates the transition between each item.
