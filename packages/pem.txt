Here's a detailed technical blog on the "pem" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Overview of the "pem" Flutter Package

The "pem" package in Flutter is a powerful tool designed for handling PEM (Privacy-Enhanced Mail) formatted data, which is commonly used for encoding cryptographic keys and certificates. This package simplifies the process of reading, writing, and manipulating PEM files, making it an essential resource for developers working with secure communications, such as SSL/TLS certificates, public/private keys, and other cryptographic materials.

## When to Use the "pem" Package

You should consider using the "pem" package in scenarios such as:

- **SSL/TLS Certificate Management**: When you need to read or write SSL certificates in PEM format for secure communications.
- **Cryptographic Key Handling**: If your application requires the use of public/private keys for encryption/decryption or signing/verifying data.
- **Interfacing with APIs**: When working with APIs that require PEM formatted keys or certificates for authentication.

## Key Features

- **PEM Encoding/Decoding**: Easily convert between PEM and DER formats.
- **Key and Certificate Management**: Functions to extract and manage keys and certificates from PEM files.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

By leveraging the "pem" package, developers can streamline their cryptographic operations and ensure secure data handling in their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the "pem" Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the "pem" package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and include the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  pem: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/pem).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the package as follows:

```dart
import 'package:pem/pem.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to read a PEM file and extract a public key:

```dart
void main() {
  // Sample PEM formatted public key
  String pemData = """
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQ...
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
""";

  // Decode the PEM data
  var pem = Pem.fromPem(pemData);
  
  // Access the public key
  var publicKey = pem.content;
  
  print('Public Key: $publicKey');
}
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to read a PEM formatted public key and extract its content for further use.

# Complete Example of Using the "pem" Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pem/pem.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'PEM Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('PEM Package Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Sample PEM formatted public key
              String pemData = """
              -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
              MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQ...
              -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
              """;

              // Decode the PEM data
              var pem = Pem.fromPem(pemData);
              
              // Access the public key
              var publicKey = pem.content;
              
              // Display the public key
              showDialog(
                context: context,
                builder: (context) {
                  return AlertDialog(
                    title: Text('Public Key'),
                    content: Text(publicKey),
                    actions: [
                      TextButton(
                        onPressed: () {
                          Navigator.of(context).pop();
                        },
                        child: Text('Close'),
                      ),
                    ],
                  );
                },
              );
            },
            child: Text('Show Public Key'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget with an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, a sample PEM formatted public key is defined.
// 5. The PEM data is decoded using Pem.fromPem() to extract the public key content.
// 6. An AlertDialog is displayed showing the extracted public key.
// 7. The user can close the dialog by pressing the 'Close' button.
```
