## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the `pedometer_2` package in scenarios such as:
- **Fitness Tracking Apps**: To monitor user activity and provide insights into their daily step count.
- **Health Monitoring Applications**: To encourage users to stay active by tracking their movements.
- **Gamification**: To create challenges based on step counts, motivating users to walk more.

## Features

- **Real-time Step Count**: Provides real-time updates on the number of steps taken.
- **Platform Compatibility**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup and usage, making it accessible for developers of all skill levels.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Pedometer_2 Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `pedometer_2` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  pedometer_2: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open the `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open the `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following keys to request permission for motion tracking:

```xml
<key>NSMotionUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to motion data to track steps.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the pedometer functionality.

<!-- END_TUTORIAL -->

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pedometer_2/pedometer_2.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to hold the step count
  int _stepCount = 0;

  // Stream to listen for step count updates
  late Stream<StepCount> _stepCountStream;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the step count stream
    _stepCountStream = Pedometer2.stepCountStream;
    // Listen for step count updates
    _stepCountStream.listen((StepCount stepCount) {
      setState(() {
        // Update the step count variable
        _stepCount = stepCount.steps;
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Pedometer Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text(
                'Steps taken:',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
              Text(
                '$_stepCount',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 48, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget, we define a stateful widget to manage the step count.
// 3. The _stepCount variable holds the current number of steps.
// 4. The _stepCountStream is initialized in the initState method, which listens for updates from the pedometer.
// 5. When a new step count is received, the setState method is called to update the UI with the new step count.
// 6. The build method constructs the UI, displaying the total steps taken in a centered column.
```
