# Google Maps Directions Flutter Package

The `google_maps_directions` Flutter package is a powerful tool that allows developers to integrate Google Maps directions into their Flutter applications. This package simplifies the process of fetching and displaying directions between two or more locations, making it ideal for applications that require navigation features, such as ride-sharing apps, travel planners, or any app that needs to provide users with route information.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `google_maps_directions` package when:
- You need to display driving, walking, or biking directions on a map.
- Your application requires real-time navigation features.
- You want to enhance user experience by providing route details, estimated travel time, and distance.

## Features

- **Route Calculation**: Easily calculate routes between multiple waypoints.
- **Travel Modes**: Support for different travel modes, including driving, walking, and biking.
- **Customizable Map**: Integrate with Google Maps to display routes on a map.
- **Detailed Directions**: Get step-by-step directions for the route.

This package is a great addition to any Flutter application that requires mapping and navigation capabilities.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Google Maps Directions Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `google_maps_directions` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  google_maps_flutter: ^2.0.6
  google_maps_directions: ^1.0.0
```

## Step 2: Configure Android

For Android, you need to set up the Google Maps API key. Follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create a new project or select an existing one.
3. Enable the Google Maps Directions API and Google Maps SDK for Android.
4. Generate an API key and add it to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<manifest>
    <application>
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
            android:value="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"/>
    </application>
</manifest>
```

## Step 3: Configure iOS

For iOS, you also need to set up the Google Maps API key. Follow these steps:

1. Open your `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift` file.
2. Import Google Maps and provide your API key in the `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method:

```swift
import UIKit
import Flutter
import GoogleMaps

@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: FlutterAppDelegate {
    override func application(
        _ application: UIApplication,
        didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?
    ) -> Bool {
        GMSServices.provideAPIKey("YOUR_API_KEY_HERE")
        GeneratedPluginRegistrant.register(with: self)
        return true
    }
}
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a complete example demonstrating how to use the `google_maps_directions` package.

# Complete Example: Google Maps Directions in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:google_maps_flutter/google_maps_flutter.dart';
import 'package:google_maps_directions/google_maps_directions.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Google Maps Directions Example',
      home: DirectionsScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class DirectionsScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DirectionsScreenState createState() => _DirectionsScreenState();
}

class _DirectionsScreenState extends State<DirectionsScreen> {
  GoogleMapController? mapController; // Controller for Google Map
  List<LatLng> routeCoordinates = []; // List to hold route coordinates
  String? _error; // Variable to hold error messages

  // Method to fetch directions
  void getDirections() async {
    // Define start and end locations
    final startLocation = LatLng(37.7749, -122.4194); // San Francisco
    final endLocation = LatLng(34.0522, -118.2437); // Los Angeles

    // Fetch directions using the package
    Directions directions = await GoogleMapsDirections.getDirections(
      origin: startLocation,
      destination: endLocation,
      travelMode: TravelMode.driving,
      apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE', // Your Google Maps API key
    );

    // Check for errors
    if (directions.status == 'OK') {
      // Extract route coordinates
      setState(() {
        routeCoordinates = directions.routes[0].polyline.decode();
      });
    } else {
      setState(() {
        _error = directions.status; // Set error message
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    getDirections(); // Fetch directions on initialization
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Google Maps Directions'),
      ),
      body: GoogleMap(
        onMapCreated: (controller) {
          mapController = controller; // Initialize map controller
        },
        initialCameraPosition: CameraPosition(
          target: LatLng(36.7783, -119.4179), // Center of California
          zoom: 6,
        ),
        polylines: {
          Polyline(
            polylineId: PolylineId('route'),
            points: routeCoordinates,
            color: Colors.blue,
            width: 5,
          ),
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget sets up the MaterialApp and directs to the DirectionsScreen.
// 3. In the DirectionsScreen, the getDirections method is called in initState to fetch the route.
// 4. The GoogleMapsDirections package is used to get directions from San Francisco to Los Angeles.
// 5. If successful, the route coordinates are stored in routeCoordinates and displayed on the map.
// 6. If there's an error, the error message is stored in _error and can be displayed to the user.
```
