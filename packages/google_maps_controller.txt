# Tutorial: Setting Up Google Maps Controller

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `google_maps_controller` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `google_maps_controller` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  google_maps_controller: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Configure Android

For Android, you need to add the Google Maps API key to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following inside the `<application>` tag:

```xml
<meta-data
    android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
    android:value="YOUR_API_KEY"/>
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual Google Maps API key.

## Step 3: Configure iOS

For iOS, you need to enable the Maps capability in your Xcode project. Open your project in Xcode, navigate to the project settings, and enable the Maps capability. Additionally, add the following to your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show it on the map.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show it on the map.</string>
```

## Step 4: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:google_maps_controller/google_maps_controller.dart';
```

## Step 5: Initialize the Map

You can now initialize the map in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to do this:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Google Maps Example')),
        body: GoogleMap(
          initialCameraPosition: CameraPosition(
            target: LatLng(37.7749, -122.4194), // San Francisco
            zoom: 10,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Google Map centered on San Francisco.

# Complete Example of Google Maps Controller

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:google_maps_controller/google_maps_controller.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Google Maps Example')),
        body: GoogleMap(
          initialCameraPosition: CameraPosition(
            target: LatLng(37.7749, -122.4194), // San Francisco
            zoom: 10, // Initial zoom level
          ),
          markers: {
            Marker(
              markerId: MarkerId('san_francisco'),
              position: LatLng(37.7749, -122.4194), // Marker position
              infoWindow: InfoWindow(title: 'San Francisco'), // Info window
            ),
          },
          onMapCreated: (GoogleMapController controller) {
            // Called when the map is created
            // You can perform additional setup here
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The MaterialApp widget is created, providing the app's structure.
// 3. A Scaffold widget is used to create the basic visual layout, including an AppBar and body.
// 4. The GoogleMap widget is initialized with an initial camera position set to San Francisco.
// 5. A marker is added to the map at the same location, with an info window displaying the title "San Francisco".
// 6. The onMapCreated callback allows for additional setup once the map is fully loaded.
```
