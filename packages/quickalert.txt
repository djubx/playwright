# QuickAlert Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with QuickAlert, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  quickalert: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the QuickAlert package:

```dart
import 'package:quickalert/quickalert.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using QuickAlert

### Basic Usage

You can display a simple alert using the following code:

```dart
QuickAlert.show(
  context: context,
  type: QuickAlertType.success,
  title: "Success!",
  text: "Your action was successful.",
);
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

#### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Customizing Alerts

You can customize the alerts further by adding buttons, changing colors, and more. Hereâ€™s an example of a customizable alert:

```dart
QuickAlert.show(
  context: context,
  type: QuickAlertType.warning,
  title: "Warning!",
  text: "Are you sure you want to proceed?",
  confirmBtnText: "Yes",
  cancelBtnText: "No",
  onConfirmBtnTap: () {
    // Handle confirmation action
  },
);
```

With these steps, you can easily integrate QuickAlert into your Flutter application and start using it to enhance user interactions.

# Complete Example of QuickAlert in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:quickalert/quickalert.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'QuickAlert Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('QuickAlert Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Show a success alert when the button is pressed
            QuickAlert.show(
              context: context,
              type: QuickAlertType.success,
              title: "Success!",
              text: "Your action was successful.",
              confirmBtnText: "OK",
            );
          },
          child: Text('Show Success Alert'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, there is an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, it triggers the QuickAlert.show() method to display a success alert.
// 6. The alert shows a title and message, along with a confirmation button that dismisses the alert when pressed.
