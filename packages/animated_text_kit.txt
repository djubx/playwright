# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Animated Text Kit

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `animated_text_kit` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  animated_text_kit: ^4.2.1  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement an animated text widget.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_text_kit/animated_text_kit.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Animated Text Kit Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: AnimatedTextKit(
            animatedTexts: [
              TypewriterAnimatedText(
                'Welcome to RealFlutter!',
                textStyle: TextStyle(
                  fontSize: 32.0,
                  fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
                ),
                speed: Duration(milliseconds: 200),
              ),
              FadeAnimatedText(
                'Let\'s create amazing apps!',
                textStyle: TextStyle(
                  fontSize: 32.0,
                  fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
                ),
                duration: Duration(seconds: 2),
              ),
            ],
            totalRepeatCount: 5,
            pause: Duration(milliseconds: 1000),
            displayFullTextOnTap: true,
            stopPauseOnTap: true,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that displays animated text using the `TypewriterAnimatedText` and `FadeAnimatedText` animations.

# Complete Example: RealFlutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_text_kit/animated_text_kit.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Animated Text Kit Example'), // Title of the app
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: AnimatedTextKit(
            animatedTexts: [
              // Typewriter animation for the first text
              TypewriterAnimatedText(
                'Welcome to RealFlutter!', // Text to display
                textStyle: TextStyle(
                  fontSize: 32.0, // Font size
                  fontWeight: FontWeight.bold, // Font weight
                ),
                speed: Duration(milliseconds: 200), // Speed of the typewriter effect
              ),
              // Fade animation for the second text
              FadeAnimatedText(
                'Let\'s create amazing apps!', // Text to display
                textStyle: TextStyle(
                  fontSize: 32.0, // Font size
                  fontWeight: FontWeight.bold, // Font weight
                ),
                duration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Duration of the fade effect
              ),
            ],
            totalRepeatCount: 5, // Total number of times the animations will repeat
            pause: Duration(milliseconds: 1000), // Pause duration between animations
            displayFullTextOnTap: true, // Display full text on tap
            stopPauseOnTap: true, // Stop pause on tap
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter class builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The AppBar displays the title of the app.
// 4. The body contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 5. AnimatedTextKit is used to create a series of animated text widgets.
// 6. The first animation is a typewriter effect that types out "Welcome to RealFlutter!".
// 7. The second animation fades in "Let's create amazing apps!".
// 8. The animations repeat a total of 5 times with a pause of 1 second between them.
// 9. Users can tap to display the full text and pause the animations.
