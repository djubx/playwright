# Overview of the `audible_mode` Flutter Package

The `audible_mode` package is a Flutter plugin designed to manage audio focus and control the audible state of your application. This package is particularly useful for applications that play audio, such as music players, podcasts, or any app that requires audio playback. It allows developers to handle audio interruptions gracefully, ensuring a seamless user experience.

## When to Use `audible_mode`
- **Audio Playback Applications**: If your app plays audio content, managing audio focus is crucial to prevent interruptions.
- **Media Control**: For apps that require background audio playback, this package helps maintain audio focus when the app is in the background or when other audio sources are active.
- **User Experience**: To enhance user experience by managing audio interruptions and ensuring that audio playback behaves as expected.

## Key Features
- **Audio Focus Management**: Request and abandon audio focus to control playback behavior.
- **Interruption Handling**: Listen for audio interruptions and respond accordingly.
- **Platform Compatibility**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

# Setting Up and Using the `audible_mode` Package

## Installation
To add the `audible_mode` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  audible_mode: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions to enable audio playback:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to allow background audio playback:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>audio</string>
</array>
```

## Using the Package
To use the `audible_mode` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:audible_mode/audible_mode.dart';
```

You can then create an instance of the `AudibleMode` class and manage audio focus as needed.

```dart
void main() {
  // Initialize the AudibleMode instance
  final audibleMode = AudibleMode();

  // Request audio focus
  audibleMode.requestAudioFocus();

  // Handle audio interruptions
  audibleMode.onAudioInterruption.listen((event) {
    // Handle the interruption event
  });
}
```

This setup allows you to manage audio focus and respond to interruptions effectively.

# Complete Example of Using `audible_mode`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:audible_mode/audible_mode.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Create an instance of AudibleMode
  final AudibleMode audibleMode = AudibleMode();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Request audio focus when the app starts
    audibleMode.requestAudioFocus();

    // Listen for audio interruption events
    audibleMode.onAudioInterruption.listen((event) {
      // Handle audio interruption
      if (event == AudioInterruptionType.start) {
        // Pause audio playback
        print("Audio playback paused due to interruption.");
      } else if (event == AudioInterruptionType.end) {
        // Resume audio playback
        print("Audio playback resumed.");
      }
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Abandon audio focus when the app is disposed
    audibleMode.abandonAudioFocus();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Audible Mode Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Managing Audio Focus with audible_mode'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and the main function runs, initializing the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget's state, an instance of AudibleMode is created.
// 3. During the initState method, audio focus is requested to allow audio playback.
// 4. The app listens for audio interruption events. If an interruption starts, it pauses playback; if it ends, it resumes playback.
// 5. When the app is disposed, it abandons audio focus to clean up resources.
// 6. The UI consists of a simple MaterialApp with a title and a centered text message.
