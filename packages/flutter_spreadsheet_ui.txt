# Setting Up and Using flutter_spreadsheet_ui

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_spreadsheet_ui` package and provide guidance on how to use it effectively in your Flutter applications.

## Installation

To add the `flutter_spreadsheet_ui` package to your Flutter project, follow these steps:

1. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file.
2. Add the package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     flutter_spreadsheet_ui: ^latest_version
   ```

3. Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android
- Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS
- For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

## Basic Usage

To use the `flutter_spreadsheet_ui` package, you can create a simple spreadsheet interface as follows:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_spreadsheet_ui/flutter_spreadsheet_ui.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Spreadsheet Example')),
        body: Spreadsheet(
          rows: 10,
          columns: 5,
          cellBuilder: (context, row, column) {
            return Cell(
              child: Center(child: Text('R$row C$column')),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple spreadsheet with 10 rows and 5 columns, where each cell displays its row and column number.

# Complete Example of flutter_spreadsheet_ui

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_spreadsheet_ui/flutter_spreadsheet_ui.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Spreadsheet Example')),
        body: Spreadsheet(
          rows: 10, // Define the number of rows
          columns: 5, // Define the number of columns
          cellBuilder: (context, row, column) {
            return Cell(
              child: Center(child: Text('R$row C$column')), // Display row and column numbers
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The above code creates a simple Flutter application with a spreadsheet interface.
// 1. We import the necessary packages: Material and flutter_spreadsheet_ui.
// 2. The RealFlutter class extends StatelessWidget, which is a basic Flutter widget.
// 3. In the build method, we create a MaterialApp and a Scaffold to hold our UI.
// 4. The AppBar displays the title of the application.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains a Spreadsheet widget.
// 6. We define 10 rows and 5 columns for the spreadsheet.
// 7. The cellBuilder function is used to customize the content of each cell.
// 8. Each cell displays its respective row and column number, centered within the cell.
// 
// This example demonstrates the basic functionality of the flutter_spreadsheet_ui package, 
// allowing you to create a simple yet interactive spreadsheet interface in your Flutter app.
