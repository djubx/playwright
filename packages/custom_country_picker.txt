# Tutorial: Setting Up Custom Country Picker

## Installation
To use the `custom_country_picker` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  custom_country_picker: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/custom_country_picker).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` if you are accessing location services. However, for the country picker itself, no special permissions are required.

## Usage
To use the `custom_country_picker`, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:
   ```dart
   import 'package:custom_country_picker/custom_country_picker.dart';
   ```

2. Create a stateful widget to manage the country selection:
   ```dart
   class CountryPickerExample extends StatefulWidget {
     @override
     _CountryPickerExampleState createState() => _CountryPickerExampleState();
   }

   class _CountryPickerExampleState extends State<CountryPickerExample> {
     String? selectedCountry;

     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return Scaffold(
         appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Country Picker Example')),
         body: Center(
           child: Column(
             mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
             children: [
               Text(selectedCountry ?? 'Select a country'),
               ElevatedButton(
                 onPressed: () async {
                   final country = await showCountryPicker(
                     context: context,
                     showPhoneCode: true, // optional
                   );
                   setState(() {
                     selectedCountry = country?.name;
                   });
                 },
                 child: Text('Pick a Country'),
               ),
             ],
           ),
         ),
       );
     }
   }
   ```

3. Finally, use the `CountryPickerExample` widget in your app's main widget.

# Complete Example of Custom Country Picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:custom_country_picker/custom_country_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Custom Country Picker Example',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: CountryPickerExample(),
    );
  }
}

class CountryPickerExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CountryPickerExampleState createState() => _CountryPickerExampleState();
}

class _CountryPickerExampleState extends State<CountryPickerExample> {
  String? selectedCountry; // Variable to hold the selected country

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Country Picker Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the selected country or a prompt to select one
            Text(selectedCountry ?? 'Select a country'),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () async {
                // Show the country picker dialog
                final country = await showCountryPicker(
                  context: context,
                  showPhoneCode: true, // Optionally show phone code
                );
                // Update the state with the selected country
                setState(() {
                  selectedCountry = country?.name; // Store the selected country name
                });
              },
              child: Text('Pick a Country'), // Button to trigger country picker
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home of the app is set to CountryPickerExample, which is a stateful widget.
// 4. Inside CountryPickerExample, we have a variable to hold the selected country.
// 5. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 6. In the Center widget, we display the selected country or a prompt to select one.
// 7. An ElevatedButton is provided to open the country picker dialog.
// 8. When the button is pressed, the showCountryPicker function is called.
// 9. The selected country is then stored in the state and displayed on the screen.
