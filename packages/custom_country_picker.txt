In summary, the code flows as follows:

1. The user runs the app and is presented with a country picker.
2. The user selects a country from the list.
3. The selected country is displayed below the country picker.
4. The user can change their selection by tapping on a different country.
5. The newly selected country is displayed below the country picker.

This example demonstrates how to use the `custom_country_picker` package to create a customizable country picker in Flutter.
