# Overview of the `autoequal_gen` Flutter Package

The `autoequal_gen` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that automates the generation of equality and hash code methods for classes. This package is particularly useful when working with data models, as it simplifies the process of implementing the `==` operator and `hashCode` method, ensuring that your classes can be compared and used in collections effectively.

## When to Use `autoequal_gen`

You should consider using `autoequal_gen` in scenarios where:
- You have multiple data classes that require equality checks.
- You want to reduce boilerplate code in your Flutter applications.
- You need to ensure that your data models can be used in collections like `Set` or as keys in `Map`.

## Key Features
- **Automatic Code Generation**: Automatically generates `==` and `hashCode` methods for your classes.
- **Customizable**: Allows you to specify which fields to include in equality checks.
- **Integration with Build Runner**: Works seamlessly with the Flutter build system to regenerate code as needed.

By leveraging `autoequal_gen`, you can focus on building your application logic without worrying about the intricacies of implementing equality checks manually.

# Setting Up and Using `autoequal_gen`

## Installation

To get started with `autoequal_gen`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Here’s how to do it:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  autoequal_gen: ^1.0.0
  build_runner: ^2.0.0
```

After adding the dependencies, run the following command in your terminal to install them:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Creating a Data Class

Next, create a data class that you want to use with `autoequal_gen`. For example, let’s create a class named `RealFlutter`.

```dart
import 'package:autoequal_gen/autoequal_gen.dart';

part 'real_flutter.g.dart';

@AutoEqual()
class RealFlutter {
  final String name;
  final int age;

  RealFlutter(this.name, this.age);
}
```

### Generating Code

To generate the equality methods, run the following command:

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build
```

This command will create a file named `real_flutter.g.dart` that contains the generated equality and hash code methods.

### Platform-Specific Details

For both Android and iOS, no additional configurations are required to use `autoequal_gen`. Just ensure that you have the Flutter environment set up correctly.

## Optimizations

- **Hot Reload**: After making changes to your data classes, remember to run the build command again to regenerate the code.
- **Code Organization**: Keep your generated files in a separate directory to maintain a clean project structure.

With these steps, you are now ready to use `autoequal_gen` in your Flutter project!

# Complete Example of Using `autoequal_gen`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:autoequal_gen/autoequal_gen.dart';

part 'real_flutter.g.dart'; // Import the generated file

@AutoEqual() // Annotation to generate equality methods
class RealFlutter {
  final String name; // Field for the name
  final int age; // Field for the age

  RealFlutter(this.name, this.age); // Constructor
}

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp()); // Start the Flutter application
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'AutoEqual Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('AutoEqual Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: EqualityDemo(), // Widget to demonstrate equality
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class EqualityDemo extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create two instances of RealFlutter
    final person1 = RealFlutter('Alice', 30);
    final person2 = RealFlutter('Alice', 30);
    final person3 = RealFlutter('Bob', 25);

    // Check equality
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Text('Person 1 equals Person 2: ${person1 == person2}'), // Should be true
        Text('Person 1 equals Person 3: ${person1 == person3}'), // Should be false
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the Flutter application by calling runApp() with MyApp().
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. The Center widget contains the EqualityDemo widget, which demonstrates the equality checks.
// 4. In EqualityDemo, we create three instances of RealFlutter.
// 5. We check the equality of person1 with person2 and person3, displaying the results in Text widgets.
