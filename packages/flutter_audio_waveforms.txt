# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_audio_waveforms

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_audio_waveforms` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `flutter_audio_waveforms` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_audio_waveforms: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_audio_waveforms).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    compileSdkVersion 31 // or latest
    ...
}

dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:28.0.0' // or latest
}
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open your `ios/Podfile`.
2. Ensure that you have the following configurations:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0' # or latest
```

3. Run `pod install` in the `ios` directory to install the necessary dependencies.

## Step 3: Basic Usage
Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple widget to display an audio waveform.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_audio_waveforms/flutter_audio_waveforms.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Audio Waveform Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: AudioWaveforms(
          // Specify the audio file path
          audioFilePath: 'assets/audio/sample_audio.mp3',
          // Customize the appearance
          waveformStyle: WaveformStyle(
            color: Colors.blue,
            height: 100,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple `Scaffold` with an `AppBar` and a centered `AudioWaveforms` widget that visualizes the waveform of an audio file.

## Step 4: Running the Application
To run the application, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
flutter run
```

This will launch the app on your connected device or emulator, displaying the audio waveform.

# Complete Example of flutter_audio_waveforms

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_audio_waveforms/flutter_audio_waveforms.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Audio Waveform Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Audio Waveform Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: AudioWaveforms(
            // Specify the audio file path
            audioFilePath: 'assets/audio/sample_audio.mp3',
            // Customize the appearance
            waveformStyle: WaveformStyle(
              color: Colors.blue,
              height: 100,
            ),
            // Enable interaction
            onWaveformTap: (position) {
              // Handle tap on waveform
              print('Tapped at position: $position');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to a Scaffold, which provides the basic structure of the app.
// 4. The AppBar displays the title of the app.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains a centered AudioWaveforms widget.
// 6. The audioFilePath property specifies the path to the audio file to visualize.
// 7. The waveformStyle property customizes the appearance of the waveform.
// 8. The onWaveformTap callback allows interaction with the waveform, printing the tapped position to the console.
```
