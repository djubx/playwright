```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart

```

## Step 4: Using the Fancy Password Field
You can now use the `FancyPasswordField` widget in your application. Below is an example of how to implement it in a simple Flutter app.

### Platform-Specific Details
- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid compatibility issues.
- **iOS**: No additional configuration is required, but ensure you have the latest version of Xcode for optimal performance.

### Example Usage
You can use the `FancyPasswordField` in your widget tree as follows:

```dart
FancyPasswordField(
  controller: _passwordController,
  hintText: 'Enter your password',
  onChanged: (value) {
    // Handle password change
  },
  onVisibilityToggle: (isVisible) {
    // Handle visibility toggle
  },
),
```

This widget will provide a password input field with a toggle for visibility and customizable properties.

# Complete Example of Using Fancy Password Field

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fancy_password_field/fancy_password_field.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Fancy Password Field Example',
      home: PasswordFieldDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class PasswordFieldDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PasswordFieldDemoState createState() => _PasswordFieldDemoState();
}

class _PasswordFieldDemoState extends State<PasswordFieldDemo> {
  // Controller to manage the password input
  final TextEditingController _passwordController = TextEditingController();
  // Variable to hold the password visibility state
  bool _isPasswordVisible = false;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Fancy Password Field Demo'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Fancy password field widget
            FancyPasswordField(
              controller: _passwordController,
              hintText: 'Enter your password',
              isPasswordVisible: _isPasswordVisible,
              onChanged: (value) {
                // Handle password change
                print('Password changed: $value');
              },
              onVisibilityToggle: (isVisible) {
                // Update the visibility state
                setState(() {
                  _isPasswordVisible = isVisible;
                });
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Handle form submission
                print('Password submitted: ${_passwordController.text}');
              },
              child: Text('Submit'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget (PasswordFieldDemo).
// 3. PasswordFieldDemo is a stateful widget that manages the password input state.
// 4. Inside the build method, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a body containing the FancyPasswordField.
// 5. The FancyPasswordField is configured with a controller, hint text, and callbacks for changes and visibility toggling.
// 6. When the password is changed, it prints the new value to the console.
// 7. The visibility toggle updates the state to show or hide the password.
// 8. An ElevatedButton is provided to submit the password, which prints the entered password to the console.
