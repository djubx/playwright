# Setting Up and Using the Flutter Insider Package

## Installation

To get started with `flutter_insider`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_insider: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add any necessary permissions or configurations required by the `flutter_insider` package.

## Basic Usage

To use the `flutter_insider` package, you can start by importing it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_insider/flutter_insider.dart';
```

You can then create an instance of the main class, `RealFlutter`, and utilize its methods to fetch and display insider data.

```dart
RealFlutter insider = RealFlutter();
```

Make sure to handle any asynchronous data fetching properly using `FutureBuilder` or similar widgets to ensure a smooth user experience.

# Complete Example of Using Flutter Insider

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_insider/flutter_insider.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Insider Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: InsiderHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class InsiderHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _InsiderHomePageState createState() => _InsiderHomePageState();
}

class _InsiderHomePageState extends State<InsiderHomePage> {
  // Create an instance of RealFlutter
  RealFlutter insider = RealFlutter();
  // Variable to hold insider data
  String insiderData = "Loading...";

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Fetch insider data when the widget is initialized
    fetchInsiderData();
  }

  // Function to fetch insider data
  void fetchInsiderData() async {
    // Call the method to get data from the insider package
    String data = await insider.getInsiderData();
    // Update the state with the fetched data
    setState(() {
      insiderData = data;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Insider Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          insiderData, // Display the insider data
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme, and sets InsiderHomePage as the home.
// 3. InsiderHomePage is a stateful widget that initializes an instance of RealFlutter.
// 4. In the initState method, fetchInsiderData is called to retrieve insider data.
// 5. fetchInsiderData asynchronously calls the getInsiderData method from the RealFlutter instance.
// 6. Once the data is fetched, the state is updated, and the UI reflects the new insider data.
// 7. The data is displayed in the center of the screen using a Text widget.
