# Setting Up and Using dart_mp_analytics

## Installation
To add `dart_mp_analytics` to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dart_mp_analytics: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/dart_mp_analytics).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

3. Add any necessary configurations for your analytics provider (if applicable).

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
To start using `dart_mp_analytics`, you need to initialize it in your main application file. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dart_mp_analytics/dart_mp_analytics.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the analytics package
  DartMpAnalytics.initialize();
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Analytics Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Log a button click event
            DartMpAnalytics.logEvent('button_click', {'button_name': 'Demo Button'});
          },
          child: Text('Click Me'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize the analytics package and log a button click event when the button is pressed.

# Complete Example of dart_mp_analytics

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dart_mp_analytics/dart_mp_analytics.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the analytics package
  DartMpAnalytics.initialize();
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Analytics Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Log a button click event
            DartMpAnalytics.logEvent('button_click', {'button_name': 'Demo Button'});
          },
          child: Text('Click Me'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the DartMpAnalytics package.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is displayed as the home screen of the app.
// 4. When the user clicks the "Click Me" button, an event is logged with the name 'button_click' and a parameter indicating the button's name.
// 5. This allows developers to track user interactions and analyze them later for insights.
