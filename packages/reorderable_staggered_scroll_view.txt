# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Reorderable Staggered Scroll View

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `reorderable_staggered_scroll_view` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  reorderable_staggered_grid_view: ^0.4.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install it.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the platform version in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `ReorderableStaggeredGridView`.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:reorderable_staggered_grid_view/reorderable_staggered_grid_view.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Reorderable Staggered Grid View',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Reorderable Staggered Grid View Example'),
        ),
        body: ReorderableStaggeredGridView.count(
          crossAxisCount: 4, // Number of columns in the grid
          children: List.generate(10, (index) {
            return Card(
              key: ValueKey(index), // Unique key for each item
              color: Colors.teal[(index + 1) * 100],
              child: Center(
                child: Padding(
                  padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
                  child: Text('Item $index', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white)),
                ),
              ),
            );
          }),
          onReorder: (oldIndex, newIndex) {
            // Handle the reordering logic here
            // This is where you would update your data model
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Reorderable Staggered Grid View Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is a ReorderableStaggeredGridView, which creates a grid layout.
// 5. The grid has 4 columns (crossAxisCount: 4) and generates 10 items.
// 6. Each item is a Card widget with a unique key, colored based on its index, and displays its index.
// 7. The onReorder callback is where you would implement the logic to update your data model when items are reordered.
```
