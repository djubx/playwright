    }
}
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to send an email.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_email_sender/flutter_email_sender.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Email Sender Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              final Email email = Email(
                body: 'This is a test email from my Flutter app.',
                subject: 'Test Email',
                recipients: ['example@example.com'],
                isHTML: false,
              );

              try {
                await FlutterEmailSender.send(email);
                print('Email sent!');
              } catch (error) {
                print('Error sending email: $error');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Send Email'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() => runApp(RealFlutter());
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, an email is created and sent using the `FlutterEmailSender.send()` method.
