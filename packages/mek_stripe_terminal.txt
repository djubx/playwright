# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mek_stripe_terminal/mek_stripe_terminal.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
  // Initialize the Stripe terminal with your API key
  MekStripeTerminal.initialize('YOUR_STRIPE_API_KEY');
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Stripe Terminal Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: PaymentScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PaymentScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PaymentScreenState createState() => _PaymentScreenState();
}

class _PaymentScreenState extends State<PaymentScreen> {
  String _paymentStatus = 'Ready to pay';

  // Function to handle payment processing
  Future<void> _processPayment() async {
    try {
      // Start the payment process
      final paymentIntent = await MekStripeTerminal.createPaymentIntent(
        amount: 1000, // Amount in cents
        currency: 'usd',
      );

      // Confirm the payment
      final result = await MekStripeTerminal.confirmPayment(paymentIntent.id);

      // Update the payment status based on the result
      setState(() {
        _paymentStatus = result ? 'Payment Successful!' : 'Payment Failed!';
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during payment processing
      setState(() {
        _paymentStatus = 'Error: ${e.toString()}';
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Stripe Terminal Payment'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Payment Status: $_paymentStatus',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _processPayment,
              child: Text('Pay Now'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app initializes the Stripe terminal with the provided API key.
// 2. The main screen displays the current payment status and a button to initiate payment.
// 3. When the "Pay Now" button is pressed, the _processPayment function is called.
// 4. This function creates a payment intent with the specified amount and currency.
// 5. It then confirms the payment and updates the payment status based on the result.
// 6. The UI reflects the payment status, showing whether the payment was successful or failed.
```
