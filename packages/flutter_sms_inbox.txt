# Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_sms_inbox` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_sms_inbox: ^0.3.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open `AndroidManifest.xml` located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_SMS"/>
   ```

2. **Target SDK**: Ensure your `targetSdkVersion` is set to at least 23 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

   ```groovy
   android {
       compileSdkVersion 33
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           targetSdkVersion 33
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open `Info.plist` located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following entry to request permission to access SMS:

   ```xml
   <key>NSContactsUsageDescription</key>
   <string>This app requires access to your SMS messages.</string>
   ```

2. **Note**: iOS has strict limitations on accessing SMS messages, and you may not be able to read SMS directly as you can on Android.

## Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_sms_inbox/flutter_sms_inbox.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the `flutter_sms_inbox` package to read SMS messages. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to fetch and display SMS messages.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_sms_inbox/flutter_sms_inbox.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // List to hold SMS messages
  List<SmsMessage> messages = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Fetch SMS messages when the app starts
    fetchSms();
  }

  // Function to fetch SMS messages
  void fetchSms() async {
    // Create an instance of SmsQuery
    SmsQuery query = SmsQuery();
    // Retrieve all SMS messages
    List<SmsMessage> fetchedMessages = await query.getAllSms;
    // Update the state with the fetched messages
    setState(() {
      messages = fetchedMessages;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('SMS Inbox Example'),
        ),
        body: messages.isEmpty
            ? Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator()) // Show loading indicator
            : ListView.builder(
                itemCount: messages.length,
                itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                  // Display each SMS message in a ListTile
                  return ListTile(
                    title: Text(messages[index].body ?? ''),
                    subtitle: Text(messages[index].sender ?? ''),
                  );
                },
              ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget, we define a stateful widget to manage the SMS messages.
// 3. The initState method is overridden to fetch SMS messages when the widget is first created.
// 4. The fetchSms function uses the SmsQuery class to retrieve all SMS messages from the device.
// 5. The messages are stored in a list and the state is updated to reflect the fetched messages.
// 6. In the build method, we check if the messages list is empty. If it is, a loading indicator is shown.
// 7. Once the messages are fetched, they are displayed in a ListView, with each message shown in a ListTile.
```
