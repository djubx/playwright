# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Super Banners Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **super_banners** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  super_banners: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` file to allow network requests. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Super Banners Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a banner.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:super_banners/super_banners.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Super Banners Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: SuperBanner(
            title: 'Special Offer!',
            description: 'Get 20% off on your first purchase.',
            buttonText: 'Shop Now',
            onButtonPressed: () {
              // Handle button press
              print('Button Pressed!');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that displays a banner with a title, description, and a button. The `onButtonPressed` callback allows you to define what happens when the user taps the button.

# Complete Example of the Super Banners Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:super_banners/super_banners.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Super Banners Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: SuperBanner(
            title: 'Special Offer!',
            description: 'Get 20% off on your first purchase.',
            buttonText: 'Shop Now',
            onButtonPressed: () {
              // Handle button press
              print('Button Pressed!');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Super Banners Example'.
// 4. In the body of the Scaffold, we center the SuperBanner widget.
// 5. The SuperBanner displays a title, description, and a button.
// 6. When the button is pressed, it triggers the onButtonPressed callback, which currently prints 'Button Pressed!' to the console.
```
