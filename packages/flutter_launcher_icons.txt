# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_launcher_icons

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_launcher_icons` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter project.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

First, you need to add the `flutter_launcher_icons` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following lines:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  flutter_launcher_icons: ^0.9.2 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev

flutter_icons:
  android: true
  ios: true
  image_path: "assets/icon/app_icon.png" # Path to your icon image
```

## Step 2: Create Your Icon

Make sure you have your app icon ready. The recommended size for the source image is at least 1024x1024 pixels. Place your icon image in the specified path (e.g., `assets/icon/app_icon.png`).

## Step 3: Run the Package

After configuring your `pubspec.yaml`, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main
```

This command will generate the necessary launcher icons for both Android and iOS platforms.

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, the package will generate icons in the following directories:
- `android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-mdpi`
- `android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-hdpi`
- `android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xhdpi`
- `android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxhdpi`
- `android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxxhdpi`

### iOS

For iOS, the package will generate icons in the `ios/Runner/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset` directory. Ensure that your iOS project is set up to use the generated icons.

## Step 4: Verify the Icons

After running the command, check both the Android and iOS directories to ensure that the icons have been generated correctly. You can then run your app on an emulator or a physical device to see the new icons in action.

With these steps, you have successfully set up and used the `flutter_launcher_icons` package in your Flutter project!

# Complete Example: Using flutter_launcher_icons in a Flutter App

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Main application class
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // The MaterialApp widget is the root of the application
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Launcher Icons Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

// HomeScreen widget that serves as the main screen of the app
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Scaffold provides a structure for the visual interface
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Launcher Icons Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Welcome to RealFlutter!',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The runApp function takes the RealFlutter widget and makes it the root of the widget tree.
// 3. The RealFlutter class builds a MaterialApp, which is the main structure of the app.
// 4. The HomeScreen widget is set as the home of the MaterialApp, displaying a simple welcome message.
// 5. The AppBar at the top provides a title, and the body contains a centered text widget.
// 6. This structure allows for easy navigation and expansion of the app in the future.
