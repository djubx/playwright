// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app, and the `MyApp` widget is created.
// 2. The `MyApp` widget builds the `MaterialApp` widget, which is the root widget of the app.
// 3. The `MaterialApp` widget builds the `RealFlutter` widget, which is the home screen of the app.
// 4. The `RealFlutter` widget is a stateful widget, so it creates a `_RealFlutterState` object to manage its state.
// 5. In the `_RealFlutterState` object, we initialize the `_messages` list with two `ChatMessage` objects.
// 6. We then build the `Scaffold` widget, which is the basic material design visual layout structure.
// 7. Inside the `Scaffold` widget, we build the `ChatListView` widget, passing the `_messages` list to it.
// 8. The `ChatListView` widget builds the chat list view, using the `_messages` list to display the chat messages.
// 9. The user can then interact with the chat list view, such as scrolling through the messages or tapping on a message to view its details.
