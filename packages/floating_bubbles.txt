# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Floating Bubbles Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the **floating_bubbles** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  floating_bubbles: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Package
Now that the package is set up, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement floating bubbles in your app.

# Complete Example of Floating Bubbles

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:floating_bubbles/floating_bubbles.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Floating Bubbles Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Floating Bubbles Example'),
        ),
        body: Stack(
          children: [
            // Background color for the app
            Container(color: Colors.blue[50]),
            // Floating bubbles widget
            FloatingBubbles(
              // Number of bubbles to display
              numberOfBubbles: 10,
              // Bubble size
              bubbleSize: 50.0,
              // Bubble colors
              bubbleColors: [
                Colors.red,
                Colors.green,
                Colors.blue,
                Colors.yellow,
                Colors.purple,
              ],
              // Animation duration
              duration: Duration(seconds: 5),
              // Callback when a bubble is tapped
              onBubbleTap: (index) {
                print('Bubble $index tapped!');
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body consists of a Stack widget that allows layering of widgets.
// 5. A Container is used as the background with a light blue color.
// 6. The FloatingBubbles widget is added to the Stack, which creates floating bubbles.
// 7. The number of bubbles, their size, colors, and animation duration are specified.
// 8. An onBubbleTap callback is provided to handle taps on the bubbles, printing the index of the tapped bubble to the console.
