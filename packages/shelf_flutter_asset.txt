# Overview of the `shelf_flutter_asset` Package

The `shelf_flutter_asset` package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who need to manage and serve static assets efficiently. This package allows you to create a simple HTTP server that can serve files from your Flutter project's asset directory, making it particularly useful for applications that require dynamic asset loading or need to serve assets over a network.

## When to Use This Package
- **Dynamic Asset Loading**: If your application needs to load assets dynamically based on user input or other conditions, this package can help you serve those assets seamlessly.
- **Development and Testing**: It can be beneficial during development to serve assets without needing to rebuild the app every time you make a change.
- **Web Applications**: For Flutter web applications, this package can help manage assets more effectively.

## Key Features
- **HTTP Server**: Easily set up a local HTTP server to serve assets.
- **File Serving**: Serve files directly from the asset directory.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS, as well as Flutter web.
- **Simple API**: Provides a straightforward API for integrating asset serving into your Flutter applications.

# Setting Up and Using `shelf_flutter_asset`

## Installation
To get started with the `shelf_flutter_asset` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  shelf_flutter_asset: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/shelf_flutter_asset).

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android
1. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21.
2. No additional configurations are required for using the package.

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following permissions if you plan to access the internet:
   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

## Basic Usage
To use the `shelf_flutter_asset` package, you need to create an instance of the server and specify the directory from which to serve assets. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:shelf_flutter_asset/shelf_flutter_asset.dart';

void main() {
  final server = RealFlutter();
  server.start();
}
```

This code initializes the server and starts serving assets from the default asset directory.

# Complete Example of Using `shelf_flutter_asset`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:shelf_flutter_asset/shelf_flutter_asset.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Shelf Flutter Asset Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  late RealFlutter server;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the server to serve assets
    server = RealFlutter();
    // Start the server
    server.start();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Stop the server when the widget is disposed
    server.stop();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Asset Server Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Serving assets from the server!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. HomeScreen is a StatefulWidget that manages the server lifecycle.
// 4. In initState, we create an instance of RealFlutter and start the server.
// 5. The server serves assets from the asset directory.
// 6. When the HomeScreen is disposed, we stop the server to free resources.
// 7. The UI displays a simple message indicating that assets are being served.
