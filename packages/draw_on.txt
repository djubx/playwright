# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the draw_on Package

## Installation
To use the `draw_on` package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  draw_on: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/draw_on).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you plan to save images to the user's gallery. Add the following key:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to the photo library to save drawings.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `draw_on` package, you can create a simple widget that incorporates the drawing functionality. Below is a basic example of how to implement it in your Flutter app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:draw_on/draw_on.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Draw On Example'),
        ),
        body: DrawingWidget(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DrawingWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DrawingWidgetState createState() => _DrawingWidgetState();
}

class _DrawingWidgetState extends State<DrawingWidget> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return DrawOn(
      // Set the initial brush size and color
      brushSize: 5.0,
      brushColor: Colors.black,
      // Enable eraser functionality
      enableEraser: true,
      // Callback for when the drawing is completed
      onDrawingComplete: (image) {
        // Handle the completed drawing (e.g., save or share)
      },
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic drawing application where users can draw on the screen with a customizable brush size and color. The `DrawOn` widget handles the drawing logic and provides an eraser tool.

# Complete Example of Using draw_on

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:draw_on/draw_on.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Draw On Example'),
        ),
        body: DrawingWidget(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DrawingWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DrawingWidgetState createState() => _DrawingWidgetState();
}

class _DrawingWidgetState extends State<DrawingWidget> {
  // This method is called when the drawing is completed
  void _onDrawingComplete(Uint8List image) {
    // Here you can save the image or perform any action you want
    print('Drawing completed and image is ready to be saved or shared.');
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return DrawOn(
      // Set the initial brush size and color
      brushSize: 5.0, // Brush size for drawing
      brushColor: Colors.black, // Color of the brush
      enableEraser: true, // Enable eraser functionality
      onDrawingComplete: _onDrawingComplete, // Callback for completed drawing
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a DrawingWidget.
// 3. The DrawingWidget is a stateful widget that manages the drawing area.
// 4. Inside the DrawingWidget, the DrawOn widget is used to enable drawing functionality.
// 5. Users can draw on the screen with a black brush of size 5.0.
// 6. The eraser tool is enabled, allowing users to erase parts of their drawing.
// 7. When the drawing is completed, the _onDrawingComplete method is called, where you can handle the resulting image.
