# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Folder File Saver

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **folder_file_saver** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  folder_file_saver: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request permission for file access:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save files.</string>
<key>NSDocumentsFolderUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your documents folder to save files.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to save a text file to a custom folder.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:folder_file_saver/folder_file_saver.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: FileSaverDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class FileSaverDemo extends StatelessWidget {
  // Function to save a file
  void saveFile() async {
    String fileName = "example.txt";
    String content = "Hello, Folder File Saver!";
    
    // Save the file in a custom folder
    String path = await FolderFileSaver.saveFile(
      fileName: fileName,
      content: content,
      folderName: "MyCustomFolder",
    );

    // Show a message to the user
    print("File saved at: $path");
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Folder File Saver Demo")),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: saveFile,
          child: Text("Save File"),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Folder File Saver

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:folder_file_saver/folder_file_saver.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: FileSaverDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class FileSaverDemo extends StatelessWidget {
  // Function to save a file
  void saveFile() async {
    String fileName = "example.txt"; // Name of the file to be saved
    String content = "Hello, Folder File Saver!"; // Content to be written in the file
    
    // Save the file in a custom folder
    String path = await FolderFileSaver.saveFile(
      fileName: fileName, // File name
      content: content, // Content to save
      folderName: "MyCustomFolder", // Custom folder name
    );

    // Show a message to the user
    print("File saved at: $path"); // Log the file path
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Folder File Saver Demo")), // App bar title
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: saveFile, // Call saveFile when button is pressed
          child: Text("Save File"), // Button text
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a home set to FileSaverDemo.
// 3. In FileSaverDemo, when the "Save File" button is pressed, the saveFile function is called.
// 4. The saveFile function defines the file name and content, then calls the saveFile method from the folder_file_saver package.
// 5. The file is saved in a custom folder named "MyCustomFolder".
// 6. Once the file is saved, the path is printed to the console, indicating where the file is stored.
```
