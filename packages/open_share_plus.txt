# Tutorial: Setting Up Open Share Plus

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **open_share_plus** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the **open_share_plus** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  open_share_plus: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/open_share_plus).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open the `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open the `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions to allow sharing:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to share images.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to share photos.</string>
```

## Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:open_share_plus/open_share_plus.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the package to share content. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to share text:

```dart
void shareText(String text) {
  OpenSharePlus.share(text);
}
```

This function can be called whenever you want to share text from your application.

# Complete Example of Open Share Plus

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:open_share_plus/open_share_plus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Open Share Plus Example',
      home: ShareExampleScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ShareExampleScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Open Share Plus Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Call the share function when the button is pressed
            shareContent();
          },
          child: Text('Share Content'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void shareContent() {
    // Define the content to share
    String textToShare = "Check out this amazing Flutter package: open_share_plus!";
    
    // Use the OpenSharePlus package to share the content
    OpenSharePlus.share(textToShare);
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (ShareExampleScreen).
// 3. The ShareExampleScreen contains an AppBar and a Center widget with an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the shareContent() function is called.
// 5. The shareContent() function defines a string (textToShare) that contains the content to be shared.
// 6. Finally, it calls OpenSharePlus.share() with the textToShare string, triggering the share dialog on the device.
```

// The application flow is straightforward: it initializes the app, displays a button, and upon pressing the button, it shares a predefined text using the **open_share_plus** package. This demonstrates the core functionality of sharing content in a Flutter application.
