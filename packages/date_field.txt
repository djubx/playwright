```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Setup

### Android

Ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configuration:

```gradle
android {
    compileSdkVersion 33

    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 21
        targetSdkVersion 33
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, ensure your `ios/Podfile` is configured to use at least iOS 11.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '11.0'
```

## Using the `date_field` Package

To use the `date_field` package, import it into your Dart file:

```dart

### Basic Usage

Here is a simple example of how to use the `date_field` widget:

```dart

  decoration: InputDecoration(
    labelText: 'Select Date',

```

This code snippet creates a date field with a label and prints the selected date to the console.

# Complete Example of Using `date_field` in a Flutter Application

Below is a complete example of a Flutter application using the `date_field` package. This example demonstrates how to integrate the package and utilize its features.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:date_field/date_field.dart';

void main() => runApp(RealFlutterApp());

class RealFlutterApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Date Field Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: DateFieldExample(),
    );
  }
}

class DateFieldExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DateFieldExampleState createState() => _DateFieldExampleState();
}

class _DateFieldExampleState extends State<DateFieldExample> {
  DateTime? selectedDate;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Date Field Example'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // DateTimeField widget to select a date
            DateTimeField(
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Select Date',
                border: OutlineInputBorder(),
              ),
              mode: DateTimeFieldPickerMode.date,
              onDateSelected: (DateTime value) {
                setState(() {
                  selectedDate = value;
                });
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Display the selected date
            Text(
              selectedDate != null
                  ? 'Selected Date: ${selectedDate!.toLocal()}'.split(' ')[0]
                  : 'No date selected',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The `RealFlutterApp` class is the main entry point of the application.
// It sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme, and specifies the home widget as `DateFieldExample`.

// The `DateFieldExample` widget is a stateful widget that manages the state of the selected date.
// It uses a `DateTimeField` widget to allow users to select a date.

// The `DateTimeField` widget is configured with a label and an outline border.
// When a date is selected, the `onDateSelected` callback updates the `selectedDate` state.

// The selected date is displayed below the date picker. If no date is selected, a default message is shown.

// This example demonstrates the basic usage of the `date_field` package, including how to handle date selection and display the selected date.
