# Sprint Flutter Package: A Comprehensive Overview

The **sprint** Flutter package is designed to facilitate the management of tasks and workflows in a structured manner. It is particularly useful for developers looking to implement agile methodologies, such as Scrum or Kanban, within their applications. The package provides a set of tools to create, manage, and visualize tasks, making it easier to track progress and collaborate effectively.

## When to Use Sprint
- **Project Management Apps**: Ideal for applications that require task tracking and management.
- **Team Collaboration Tools**: Useful for building tools that help teams manage their workflows.
- **Personal Productivity Apps**: Great for individual users looking to organize their tasks efficiently.

## Key Features
- **Task Management**: Create, update, and delete tasks with ease.
- **Progress Tracking**: Visualize the status of tasks and workflows.
- **Customizable Workflows**: Adapt the package to fit various project management methodologies.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Flutter's UI capabilities, ensuring a smooth user experience.

Overall, the sprint package is a powerful tool for developers aiming to integrate task management features into their Flutter applications.

# Sprint Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the sprint package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  sprint: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, make sure to enable the necessary permissions in your `Info.plist` file if your application requires any specific capabilities.

## Basic Usage
To use the sprint package, you will typically start by creating a `RealFlutter` class that initializes the task management features. Below is a simple example of how to set up the package in your Flutter application.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sprint/sprint.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sprint Example',
      home: TaskManager(),
    );
  }
}

class TaskManager extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _TaskManagerState createState() => _TaskManagerState();
}

class _TaskManagerState extends State<TaskManager> {
  List<Task> tasks = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize tasks or load from a database
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Task Manager')),
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: tasks.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return ListTile(
            title: Text(tasks[index].title),
            subtitle: Text(tasks[index].status.toString()),
          );
        },
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          // Logic to add a new task
        },
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic task manager interface using the sprint package. You can expand upon this by adding more features such as editing tasks, changing their status, and integrating with a backend service.

# Complete Example of Sprint Package in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sprint/sprint.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sprint Example',
      home: TaskManager(),
    );
  }
}

class TaskManager extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _TaskManagerState createState() => _TaskManagerState();
}

class _TaskManagerState extends State<TaskManager> {
  List<Task> tasks = []; // List to hold tasks

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize tasks or load from a database
    tasks.add(Task(title: 'Sample Task 1', status: TaskStatus.pending));
    tasks.add(Task(title: 'Sample Task 2', status: TaskStatus.completed));
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Task Manager')),
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: tasks.length, // Count of tasks
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return ListTile(
            title: Text(tasks[index].title), // Display task title
            subtitle: Text(tasks[index].status.toString()), // Display task status
            onTap: () {
              // Logic to update task status on tap
              setState(() {
                tasks[index].status = tasks[index].status == TaskStatus.pending
                    ? TaskStatus.completed
                    : TaskStatus.pending; // Toggle status
              });
            },
          );
        },
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          // Logic to add a new task
          setState(() {
            tasks.add(Task(title: 'New Task', status: TaskStatus.pending)); // Add new task
          });
        },
        child: Icon(Icons.add), // Add button icon
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp and directs to TaskManager.
// 3. TaskManager initializes a list of tasks in initState.
// 4. The build method creates a ListView to display tasks.
// 5. Tapping a task toggles its status between pending and completed.
// 6. The FloatingActionButton allows users to add new tasks to the list.
