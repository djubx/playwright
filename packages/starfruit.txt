# Starfruit Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the Starfruit package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  starfruit: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the Starfruit package, you can start by importing it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:starfruit/starfruit.dart';
```

You can then create a simple widget using one of the Starfruit components. Hereâ€™s an example of how to use a customizable button:

```dart
StarfruitButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // Handle button press
  },
  text: 'Click Me',
  color: Colors.blue,
);
```

This button can be styled and customized further based on your requirements.

# Complete Example of Starfruit in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:starfruit/starfruit.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Starfruit Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Starfruit Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: StarfruitButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Show a snackbar when the button is pressed
            ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
              SnackBar(content: Text('Button Pressed!')),
            );
          },
          text: 'Click Me',
          color: Colors.blue,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to HomeScreen, which is another StatelessWidget.
// 4. HomeScreen builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a StarfruitButton is created.
// 6. When the button is pressed, a Snackbar is displayed at the bottom of the screen, indicating the button was pressed.
// 7. The app is responsive and will adapt to different screen sizes due to the use of Center and Scaffold widgets.
