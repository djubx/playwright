// This code creates a Flutter app with a Material Design theme and a home page that displays three Starfruit widgets.
// The first Starfruit widget has a size of 100 and a red color, and is shaped like a circle.
// The second Starfruit widget has a size of 200 and a blue color, and is shaped like a square.
// The third Starfruit widget has a size of 300 and a green color, and is shaped like a triangle.
// The app uses the Starfruit package to create the Starfruit widgets, and the Material Design theme to style the app.

// The code is organized into three main parts: the `MyApp` class, the `MyHomePage` class, and the `_MyHomePageState` class.
// The `MyApp` class is the main entry point for the app, and is responsible for creating the Material Design theme and the home page.
// The `MyHomePage` class is the home page for the app, and is responsible for displaying the three Starfruit widgets.
// The `_MyHomePageState` class is the state for the home page, and is responsible for building the UI for the home page.

// The code uses the `Starfruit` class from the Starfruit package to create the Starfruit widgets, and the `MaterialApp` class from the Flutter framework to create the Material Design theme.
// The code also uses the `Scaffold` class from the Flutter framework to create the basic layout for the home page, and the `Column` class to arrange the Starfruit widgets vertically.
