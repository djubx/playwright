In summary, the code flows as follows: the user runs the app, which creates a `MyApp` widget. The `MyApp` widget creates a `MaterialApp` with a title and theme, which in turn creates a `MyHomePage` widget as its home page. The `MyHomePage` widget creates a `ShowWhenLocked` widget to display when the device is locked, which displays a `Scaffold` widget with an `AppBar` and a `Center` widget. The `Center` widget displays a `Text` widget with the message "This widget will be displayed when the device is locked.". When the device is locked, the `ShowWhenLocked` widget is displayed on top of the lock screen.
