# Flutter Swipe Package: A Detailed Overview
=============================================

The `flutter_swipe` package is a powerful and flexible library for creating swipe gestures in Flutter applications. It provides a simple and intuitive API for handling swipe events, allowing developers to create custom swipe behaviors with ease.

### When to Use This Package

The `flutter_swipe` package is ideal for applications that require swipe gestures, such as:

* Swipe-to-delete lists
* Swipe-to-navigate between screens
* Swipe-to-reveal hidden content

### Features

* Supports both horizontal and vertical swipe gestures
* Customizable swipe thresholds and velocities
* Support for swipe gestures on both Android and iOS platforms

# Setting Up and Using the Flutter Swipe Package
=============================================

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

Add the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  flutter_swipe: ^1.0.0
```
Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:flutter_swipe/flutter_swipe.dart';
```
### Step 3: Create a Swipe Gesture

Create a swipe gesture by wrapping your widget with the `Swipe` widget:
```dart
Swipe(
  child: Container(
    width: 200,
    height: 200,
    color: Colors.blue,
  ),
  onSwipe: (direction) {
    print('Swiped $direction');
  },
)
```
### Platform-Specific Details

* On Android, the swipe gesture is triggered by a touch event.
* On iOS, the swipe gesture is triggered by a pan gesture.

### Configurations and Optimizations

* You can customize the swipe threshold and velocity by passing the `threshold` and `velocity` properties to the `Swipe` widget.
* You can also use the `onSwipeStart` and `onSwipeEnd` callbacks to perform actions when the swipe gesture starts and ends.

  }
}
```
// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user swipes left on the blue container.
// 2. The `onSwipe` callback is triggered with the swipe direction.
// 3. Based on the swipe direction, the app navigates to the second page.
// 4. The user can swipe right to go back to the first page.
// 5. The app uses the `Swipe` widget to handle swipe gestures.
// 6. The `Swipe` widget wraps the blue container and provides the `onSwipe` callback.
// 7. The `onSwipe` callback performs the navigation action based on the swipe direction.

// This code demonstrates the basic usage of the `flutter_swipe` package.
// It shows how to handle swipe gestures and perform actions based on the swipe direction.
// The app uses a simple navigation flow to demonstrate the swipe gesture.
