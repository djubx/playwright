# jtdetector Flutter Package

The `jtdetector` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to implement advanced object detection capabilities in their applications. This package leverages machine learning models to detect objects in images and video streams, making it ideal for applications in various domains such as security, retail, and augmented reality.

## When to Use jtdetector
- **Security Applications**: For detecting intruders or monitoring specific areas.
- **Retail Analytics**: To analyze customer behavior by detecting objects in retail environments.
- **Augmented Reality**: For overlaying information on detected objects in real-time.

## Features
- **Real-time Object Detection**: Capable of processing video streams for immediate feedback.
- **Multiple Object Recognition**: Detects and classifies multiple objects within a single frame.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices.
- **Custom Model Support**: Allows integration of custom-trained models for specific use cases.

The `jtdetector` package is an excellent choice for developers looking to add sophisticated object detection features to their Flutter applications.

# jtdetector Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To add the `jtdetector` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  jtdetector: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/jtdetector).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

3. If you are using a custom model, ensure that the model files are placed in the `assets` directory and referenced in the `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/models/
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the camera for object detection.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the photo library for object detection.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `jtdetector` package, you can create a simple widget that initializes the detector and processes the camera feed.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:jtdetector/jtdetector.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late JtDetector _detector;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _detector = JtDetector();
    _detector.initialize();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _detector.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Object Detection')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Camera feed will be displayed here.'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code initializes the `jtdetector` and sets up a basic Flutter application structure. The camera feed will be displayed in the body of the app once implemented.

# Complete Example of jtdetector in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:jtdetector/jtdetector.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late JtDetector _detector; // Declare the detector
  List<DetectedObject> _detectedObjects = []; // List to hold detected objects

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _detector = JtDetector(); // Initialize the detector
    _detector.initialize(); // Call the initialize method
    _detector.startDetection((List<DetectedObject> objects) {
      // Start detection and handle detected objects
      setState(() {
        _detectedObjects = objects; // Update the state with detected objects
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _detector.dispose(); // Dispose of the detector when done
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Object Detection')),
      body: Stack(
        children: [
          // Camera feed placeholder
          Center(child: Text('Camera feed will be displayed here.')),
          // Display detected objects
          ..._detectedObjects.map((object) {
            return Positioned(
              left: object.boundingBox.left,
              top: object.boundingBox.top,
              child: Container(
                width: object.boundingBox.width,
                height: object.boundingBox.height,
                decoration: BoxDecoration(
                  border: Border.all(color: Colors.red, width: 2),
                ),
                child: Text(object.label), // Show the label of the detected object
              ),
            );
          }).toList(),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The RealFlutter widget is created, which initializes the JtDetector.
// 2. The detector starts processing the camera feed and detects objects.
// 3. When objects are detected, the state is updated with the list of detected objects.
// 4. The UI displays the camera feed and overlays bounding boxes around detected objects.
// 5. Each detected object is represented by a red border and its label is displayed.
```

### Summary
In this blog post, we explored the `jtdetector` Flutter package, detailing its features, installation process, and usage. We provided a complete example of a Flutter application that utilizes the package for real-time object detection. The application initializes the detector, processes the camera feed, and displays detected objects with bounding boxes and labels. This setup can be adapted for various use cases, making `jtdetector` a versatile choice for developers looking to implement object detection in their Flutter applications.
