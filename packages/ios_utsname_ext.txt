# Overview of the `ios_utsname_ext` Flutter Package

The `ios_utsname_ext` package is a Flutter plugin that provides a way to access detailed information about the device's operating system and hardware. This package is particularly useful for developers who need to gather system information for analytics, debugging, or feature adaptation based on the device's capabilities.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the `ios_utsname_ext` package in scenarios such as:
- **Device Analytics**: Collecting data about the devices your app is running on to improve user experience.
- **Feature Adaptation**: Enabling or disabling features based on the device's OS version or hardware specifications.
- **Debugging**: Gathering system information to help diagnose issues that may be specific to certain devices or OS versions.

## Key Features
- Access to detailed device information such as model, OS version, and more.
- Cross-platform support for both iOS and Android.
- Simple API for easy integration into existing Flutter applications.

With these features, `ios_utsname_ext` allows developers to create more responsive and adaptive applications that can cater to a wide range of devices and operating systems.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `ios_utsname_ext`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `ios_utsname_ext` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ios_utsname_ext: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, ensure that your project is set up to support the necessary permissions. Open your `Info.plist` file and add any required permissions if you plan to access sensitive information. However, for basic device information, no additional permissions are typically required.

### Android Configuration

For Android, you may need to ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set appropriately in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:ios_utsname_ext/ios_utsname_ext.dart';
```

You can now access device information using the `RealFlutter` class. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to retrieve and display device information.

# Complete Example of Using `ios_utsname_ext`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ios_utsname_ext/ios_utsname_ext.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Device Info Example',
      home: DeviceInfoScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class DeviceInfoScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DeviceInfoScreenState createState() => _DeviceInfoScreenState();
}

class _DeviceInfoScreenState extends State<DeviceInfoScreen> {
  String _deviceInfo = 'Fetching device info...'; // Placeholder for device info

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _fetchDeviceInfo(); // Fetch device info when the widget is initialized
  }

  // Method to fetch device information
  Future<void> _fetchDeviceInfo() async {
    try {
      // Retrieve device information using the ios_utsname_ext package
      final deviceInfo = await IosUtsnameExt.getDeviceInfo();
      setState(() {
        _deviceInfo = 'Model: ${deviceInfo.model}, OS: ${deviceInfo.osVersion}'; // Update state with device info
      });
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        _deviceInfo = 'Failed to get device info: $e'; // Handle any errors
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Device Info'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(_deviceInfo), // Display the device information
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```
// Explanation of the application flow:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (DeviceInfoScreen).
// 3. The DeviceInfoScreen is a stateful widget that initializes its state in initState().
// 4. In initState(), the _fetchDeviceInfo() method is called to retrieve device information.
// 5. The _fetchDeviceInfo() method uses the ios_utsname_ext package to get device info asynchronously.
// 6. Once the device info is retrieved, the state is updated, and the UI reflects the device model and OS version.
// 7. If an error occurs during the fetching process, an error message is displayed instead.
// 8. The device information is displayed in the center of the screen using a Text widget.
