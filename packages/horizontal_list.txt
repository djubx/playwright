# Horizontal List Flutter Package

The `horizontal_list` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to create horizontal scrolling lists in Flutter applications. This package is particularly useful when you want to display a series of items in a horizontal format, such as image galleries, product listings, or any other content that benefits from horizontal navigation.

## When to Use

You should consider using the `horizontal_list` package when:
- You need to display a list of items that can be scrolled horizontally.
- You want to create a visually appealing layout that enhances user experience.
- You are working on applications that require quick access to multiple items without taking up too much vertical space.

## Features

- **Customizable Item Size**: You can define the size of each item in the list.
- **Infinite Scrolling**: Supports infinite scrolling, allowing users to keep scrolling through items.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate into existing Flutter applications.

Overall, the `horizontal_list` package provides a flexible and efficient way to implement horizontal lists in your Flutter projects, enhancing both functionality and aesthetics.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Horizontal List Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `horizontal_list` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  horizontal_list: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Horizontal List

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a horizontal list.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:horizontal_list/horizontal_list.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Horizontal List Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: HorizontalList(
            itemCount: 10, // Number of items in the list
            itemBuilder: (context, index) {
              return Container(
                width: 100, // Width of each item
                color: Colors.blue,
                child: Center(
                  child: Text(
                    'Item $index',
                    style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
                  ),
                ),
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple horizontal list that displays ten items. Each item is a blue container with centered text.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we covered how to set up the `horizontal_list` package in your Flutter project, including platform-specific configurations for Android and iOS. We also provided a basic example of how to implement a horizontal list in your application.

# Complete Example of Horizontal List in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:horizontal_list/horizontal_list.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Horizontal List Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          // Centering the Horizontal List in the body
          child: HorizontalList(
            itemCount: 10, // Total number of items to display
            itemBuilder: (context, index) {
              // Building each item in the horizontal list
              return Container(
                width: 100, // Width of each item
                color: Colors.blue, // Background color of the item
                child: Center(
                  // Centering the text within the item
                  child: Text(
                    'Item $index', // Displaying the item index
                    style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white), // Text color
                  ),
                ),
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the RealFlutter application
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the UI.
// 3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// 4. The AppBar displays the title of the application.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 6. The HorizontalList widget is used to create a horizontal scrolling list.
// 7. The itemCount property defines how many items will be displayed.
// 8. The itemBuilder function is called for each item, creating a Container with a specified width and background color.
// 9. Each Container displays its index in the center, styled with white text.
// 10. Finally, the runApp function is called to launch the application.
