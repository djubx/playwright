# Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To use the `flutter_macos_webview` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_macos_webview: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_macos_webview).

## Step 2: Configure macOS Project
After adding the dependency, you need to configure your macOS project. Open the `macos/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode.

1. **Enable App Transport Security**: If you are loading content from the web, you may need to configure App Transport Security settings in your `Info.plist` file. Add the following lines to allow arbitrary loads:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. **Set Up WebView**: Ensure that your macOS deployment target is set to at least macOS 10.14 (Mojave) or later.

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a web view.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_macos_webview/flutter_macos_webview.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('WebView Example'),
        ),
        body: WebView(
          initialUrl: 'https://flutter.dev',
          javascriptMode: JavascriptMode.unrestricted,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

### Platform-Specific Details
- **Android**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` if you are loading external URLs.
- **iOS**: Similar to macOS, you may need to configure App Transport Security in your `Info.plist`.

### Optimizations
- **Caching**: Consider implementing caching strategies for better performance.
- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to manage failed loads gracefully.

With these steps, you should be able to successfully integrate the `flutter_macos_webview` package into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of flutter_macos_webview

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_macos_webview/flutter_macos_webview.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('WebView Example'),
        ),
        body: WebView(
          // Initial URL to load when the web view is created
          initialUrl: 'https://flutter.dev',
          // Allow JavaScript execution
          javascriptMode: JavascriptMode.unrestricted,
          // Optional: Handle page loading events
          onPageFinished: (String url) {
            print('Page finished loading: $url');
          },
          // Optional: Handle errors
          onWebResourceError: (error) {
            print('Error loading page: ${error.description}');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  // Run the Flutter application
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a WebView.
3. The WebView is initialized with a URL (https://flutter.dev) and allows JavaScript execution.
4. When the page finishes loading, the onPageFinished callback is triggered, printing the loaded URL to the console.
5. If there is an error loading the page, the onWebResourceError callback is triggered, printing the error description to the console.
6. The user can interact with the web content displayed in the WebView, providing a seamless experience within the Flutter application.
