# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Material Color Generator

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `material_color_generator` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  material_color_generator: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:material_color_generator/material_color_generator.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package

You can now use the `MaterialColorGenerator` class to create color palettes. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
// Generate a color palette based on a primary color
MaterialColor primaryColor = MaterialColorGenerator.generateColorPalette(Color(0xFF6200EE));
```

This will generate a MaterialColor based on the provided primary color.

With these steps, you are now ready to use the `material_color_generator` package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Material Color Generator

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:material_color_generator/material_color_generator.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Generate a color palette based on a primary color
    MaterialColor primaryColor = MaterialColorGenerator.generateColorPalette(Color(0xFF6200EE));

    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Material Color Generator Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: primaryColor, // Use the generated primary color
      ),
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Material Color Generator Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text(
                'Hello, Flutter!',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: primaryColor[900]), // Use a dark shade for text
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Action when button is pressed
                },
                child: Text('Press Me'),
                style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(primary: primaryColor[500]), // Use a medium shade for button
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a custom theme using the generated primary color.
// 3. The AppBar displays the title of the app.
// 4. The body contains a centered column with a greeting text and a button.
// 5. The text color is set to a dark shade of the primary color, while the button uses a medium shade.
// 6. When the button is pressed, an action can be defined (currently a placeholder).
```

```

### Summary of the Code Flow
The application starts with the `main()` function, which initializes the Flutter app. The `RealFlutter` widget builds a `MaterialApp` with a theme that uses a dynamically generated primary color palette. The app features a simple UI with a greeting text and a button, showcasing how to apply the generated colors effectively. The button currently has a placeholder action, which can be customized as needed. This example demonstrates the ease of integrating the `material_color_generator` package into a Flutter application, allowing for a visually appealing and cohesive design.
