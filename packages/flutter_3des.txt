Here's a detailed technical blog on the `flutter_3des` Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Flutter 3DES Package: A Comprehensive Overview

The `flutter_3des` package is a Flutter plugin that provides a simple and efficient way to implement the Triple DES (3DES) encryption algorithm in your Flutter applications. 3DES is a symmetric-key block cipher that applies the DES algorithm three times to each data block, enhancing security compared to its predecessor, DES.

## When to Use `flutter_3des`

You might consider using the `flutter_3des` package in scenarios such as:
- **Secure Data Transmission**: When you need to encrypt sensitive data before sending it over the network.
- **Data Storage**: If you want to securely store sensitive information on the device, such as user credentials or personal data.
- **Legacy Systems**: When integrating with systems that still rely on 3DES for encryption.

## Features

- **Easy Integration**: The package is straightforward to integrate into your Flutter project.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Simple API**: Provides a simple API for encryption and decryption operations.
- **Customizable**: Allows for custom key sizes and modes of operation.

In the following sections, we will walk through the setup process and provide a complete example of how to use the `flutter_3des` package in a Flutter application.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `flutter_3des`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_3des` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_3des: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_3des/flutter_3des.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package

You can now use the `RealFlutter` class to encrypt and decrypt data. Below is a simple example of how to do this:

```dart
// Create an instance of the RealFlutter class
final realFlutter = RealFlutter();
```

You can call the `encrypt` and `decrypt` methods as follows:

```dart
String key = "123456789012345678901234"; // 24-byte key for 3DES
String plaintext = "Hello, Flutter 3DES!";
String encrypted = realFlutter.encrypt(plaintext, key);
String decrypted = realFlutter.decrypt(encrypted, key);
```

This will encrypt the plaintext and then decrypt it back to its original form.

With these steps, you are now ready to use the `flutter_3des` package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example: Using `flutter_3des` in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_3des/flutter_3des.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter 3DES Example',
      home: EncryptionDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class EncryptionDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _EncryptionDemoState createState() => _EncryptionDemoState();
}

class _EncryptionDemoState extends State<EncryptionDemo> {
  final RealFlutter realFlutter = RealFlutter(); // Instance of RealFlutter
  String encryptedText = '';
  String decryptedText = '';
  final String key = "123456789012345678901234"; // 24-byte key for 3DES
  final String plaintext = "Hello, Flutter 3DES!"; // Text to encrypt

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    encryptData(); // Encrypt data on initialization
  }

  void encryptData() {
    // Encrypt the plaintext using the key
    encryptedText = realFlutter.encrypt(plaintext, key);
    // Decrypt the encrypted text back to plaintext
    decryptedText = realFlutter.decrypt(encryptedText, key);
    // Update the UI with the encrypted and decrypted text
    setState(() {});
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter 3DES Example'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Plaintext: $plaintext'), // Display original text
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text('Encrypted: $encryptedText'), // Display encrypted text
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text('Decrypted: $decryptedText'), // Display decrypted text
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets EncryptionDemo as the home widget.
// 3. In the EncryptionDemo widget, we create an instance of RealFlutter for encryption/decryption.
// 4. The initState() method calls encryptData() to perform encryption and decryption when the widget is initialized.
// 5. The encryptData() method encrypts the plaintext and then decrypts it back to verify the process.
// 6. The UI is updated to display the original plaintext, the encrypted text, and the decrypted text.
```
