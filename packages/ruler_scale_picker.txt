# Ruler Scale Picker Flutter Package

The **ruler_scale_picker** Flutter package is a versatile and user-friendly widget that allows developers to implement a ruler-like scale picker in their applications. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where precise measurements or selections are required, such as in design applications, games, or any app that requires user input in a scaled format.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the **ruler_scale_picker** package in the following scenarios:

- **Design Applications**: When users need to select dimensions or measurements for design elements.
- **Games**: For selecting values like speed, distance, or other metrics that require precise input.
- **Educational Apps**: To teach concepts related to measurement and scaling.

## Features

- **Customizable Scale**: You can easily customize the scale's range, step size, and appearance.
- **Touch Interaction**: The package supports touch gestures, allowing users to drag and select values intuitively.
- **Multiple Units**: It can handle different units of measurement, making it versatile for various applications.
- **Responsive Design**: The widget is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and orientations.

With these features, the **ruler_scale_picker** package provides a robust solution for any application requiring a scale picker.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Ruler Scale Picker

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **ruler_scale_picker** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  ruler_scale_picker: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Then, run the following command to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Ruler Scale Picker

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the **RulerScalePicker** widget.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ruler_scale_picker/ruler_scale_picker.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Ruler Scale Picker Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: RulerScalePicker(
            minValue: 0,
            maxValue: 100,
            step: 1,
            onChanged: (value) {
              // Handle the value change
              print('Selected value: $value');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that uses the **RulerScalePicker** widget. The `onChanged` callback is triggered whenever the user selects a new value.

# Complete Example of Ruler Scale Picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ruler_scale_picker/ruler_scale_picker.dart';

// Main class for the Flutter application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Ruler Scale Picker Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: RulerScalePicker(
            minValue: 0, // Minimum value of the scale
            maxValue: 100, // Maximum value of the scale
            step: 1, // Step size for the scale
            onChanged: (value) {
              // This callback is triggered when the user selects a value
              print('Selected value: $value'); // Print the selected value to the console
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter application
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
3. Inside the Center widget, the RulerScalePicker is instantiated with a minimum value of 0, a maximum value of 100, and a step size of 1.
4. When the user interacts with the RulerScalePicker, the onChanged callback is triggered, printing the selected value to the console.
5. The user can drag the ruler to select a value, and the application responds by updating the console output with the selected value.
