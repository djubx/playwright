# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Responsive Design Package

## Installation
To get started with the `responsive_design` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  responsive_design: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile` to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `responsive_design` package, you can wrap your main widget with the `Responsive` widget provided by the package. This widget will help you manage the layout based on the screen size.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the `Responsive` widget:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:responsive_design/responsive_design.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Responsive(
      mobile: MobileLayout(),
      tablet: TabletLayout(),
      desktop: DesktopLayout(),
    );
  }
}

class MobileLayout extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Mobile Layout')),
      body: Center(child: Text('This is a mobile layout')),
    );
  }
}

class TabletLayout extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Tablet Layout')),
      body: Center(child: Text('This is a tablet layout')),
    );
  }
}

class DesktopLayout extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Desktop Layout')),
      body: Center(child: Text('This is a desktop layout')),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `Responsive` widget checks the screen size and displays the appropriate layout for mobile, tablet, or desktop devices.

# Complete Example of Responsive Design Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:responsive_design/responsive_design.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Responsive Design Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // The Responsive widget determines which layout to show based on screen size
    return Responsive(
      mobile: MobileLayout(),
      tablet: TabletLayout(),
      desktop: DesktopLayout(),
    );
  }
}

class MobileLayout extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Mobile layout with a simple AppBar and centered text
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Mobile Layout')),
      body: Center(child: Text('This is a mobile layout')),
    );
  }
}

class TabletLayout extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Tablet layout with a different AppBar title and centered text
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Tablet Layout')),
      body: Center(child: Text('This is a tablet layout')),
    );
  }
}

class DesktopLayout extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Desktop layout with a unique AppBar title and centered text
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Desktop Layout')),
      body: Center(child: Text('This is a desktop layout')),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter uses the Responsive widget to determine which layout to display based on the device's screen size.
// 4. Depending on the screen size, either MobileLayout, TabletLayout, or DesktopLayout is displayed.
// 5. Each layout has its own AppBar and body content, providing a tailored experience for the user.
