# Setting Up and Using the spinner_dropdown Package

## Installation

To use the `spinner_dropdown` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  spinner_dropdown: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage

To use the `spinner_dropdown` in your Flutter application, you can follow this simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:spinner_dropdown/spinner_dropdown.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Spinner Dropdown Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: SpinnerDropdown(
            items: ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3'],
            onChanged: (value) {
              // Handle the selected value
              print('Selected: $value');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays a spinner dropdown with three options. When an option is selected, it prints the selected value to the console.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate and use the `spinner_dropdown` package in your Flutter application seamlessly.

# Complete Example of spinner_dropdown in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:spinner_dropdown/spinner_dropdown.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Spinner Dropdown Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: SpinnerDropdown(
            items: ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3'], // List of options for the dropdown
            onChanged: (value) {
              // This callback is triggered when an option is selected
              print('Selected: $value'); // Print the selected value to the console
            },
            // Optional customization
            icon: Icon(Icons.arrow_drop_down), // Custom icon for the dropdown
            hint: Text('Select an option'), // Hint text displayed when no option is selected
            isExpanded: true, // Makes the dropdown take the full width
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the `RealFlutter` class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The `MaterialApp` widget is created, providing the basic material design structure.
// 3. A `Scaffold` widget is used to create the app's layout, including an AppBar and a body.
// 4. In the body, a `Center` widget centers the `SpinnerDropdown` widget.
// 5. The `SpinnerDropdown` is initialized with a list of items, a callback for when an item is selected, and optional customization options.
// 6. When the user selects an option from the dropdown, the selected value is printed to the console.
// 7. The dropdown is fully responsive and adapts to the screen size, providing a smooth user experience.
