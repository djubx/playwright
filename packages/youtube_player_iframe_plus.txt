## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that the package is set up, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the YouTube player.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:youtube_player_iframe_plus/youtube_player_iframe_plus.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('YouTube Player Iframe Plus Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: YoutubePlayer(
            controller: YoutubePlayerController.fromVideoId(
              videoId: 'dQw4w9WgXcQ', // Replace with your video ID
              params: YoutubePlayerParams(
                showControls: true,
                showFullscreenButton: true,
                autoPlay: false,
              ),
            ),
            aspectRatio: 16 / 9,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **YoutubePlayerController**: This controller is responsible for managing the video playback. You can specify the video ID and various parameters like controls and autoplay.
- **YoutubePlayer**: This widget displays the video player. You can set the aspect ratio to ensure it fits well within your layout.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the `youtube_player_iframe_plus` package into your Flutter application successfully.

        ),
        body: Center(
          // Centering the Youtube player in the body
          child: YoutubePlayer(
            // Creating a Youtube player controller with a specific video ID
            controller: YoutubePlayerController.fromVideoId(
              videoId: 'dQw4w9WgXcQ', // Replace with your video ID
              params: YoutubePlayerParams(
                showControls: true, // Show video controls
                showFullscreenButton: true, // Show fullscreen button
                autoPlay: false, // Do not autoplay the video
              ),
            ),
            aspectRatio: 16 / 9, // Setting the aspect ratio for the player
          ),
        ),

  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
