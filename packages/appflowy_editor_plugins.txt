# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `appflowy_editor_plugins`

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `appflowy_editor_plugins` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `appflowy_editor_plugins` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  appflowy_editor_plugins: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open `ios/Podfile`.
2. Uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:appflowy_editor_plugins/appflowy_editor_plugins.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Editor

You can now use the `RealFlutter` class to create a rich text editor. Here’s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:appflowy_editor_plugins/appflowy_editor_plugins.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('AppFlowy Editor Example')),
        body: EditorWidget(), // Custom widget for the editor
      ),
    );
  }
}

class EditorWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return AppFlowyEditor(
      onChanged: (value) {
        // Handle text changes
      },
      // Additional configurations can be added here
    );
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Running the Application

After setting up the editor, run your application using:

```bash
flutter run
```

This will launch your Flutter app with the integrated rich text editor.

# Complete Example of `appflowy_editor_plugins`

Here’s a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the `appflowy_editor_plugins` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:appflowy_editor_plugins/appflowy_editor_plugins.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Start the application with RealFlutter widget
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'AppFlowy Editor Example',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: EditorScreen(), // Main screen containing the editor
    );
  }
}

class EditorScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _EditorScreenState createState() => _EditorScreenState();
}

class _EditorScreenState extends State<EditorScreen> {
  String editorContent = ''; // Variable to hold the editor content

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Rich Text Editor'),
        actions: [
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.save),
            onPressed: () {
              // Save the content to a database or file
              print('Content saved: $editorContent');
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
      body: AppFlowyEditor(
        onChanged: (value) {
          setState(() {
            editorContent = value; // Update the content on change
          });
        },
        // Additional configurations can be added here
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp and defines the theme and home screen.
// 3. The EditorScreen widget is created, which contains the AppFlowyEditor.
// 4. The editor's content is managed by the editorContent variable.
// 5. When the user types in the editor, the onChanged callback updates the editorContent.
// 6. The AppBar includes a save button that prints the current content to the console.
```
