# Tutorial: Setting Up Kakao Flutter SDK User

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `kakao_flutter_sdk_user` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `kakao_flutter_sdk_user` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  kakao_flutter_sdk_user: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/kakao_flutter_sdk_user).

## Step 2: Configure Android

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions and metadata:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.yourapp">

    <application>
        ...
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.kakao.sdk.AppKey"
            android:value="YOUR_KAKAO_APP_KEY" />
    </application>

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
</manifest>
```

Replace `YOUR_KAKAO_APP_KEY` with your actual Kakao app key.

2. **Enable Internet Permission**: Ensure that your app has internet permissions by including `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>` in the manifest.

## Step 3: Configure iOS

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following entries:

```xml
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
    <dict>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
        <array>
            <string>kakaoYOUR_KAKAO_APP_KEY</string>
        </array>
    </dict>
</array>
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

Replace `YOUR_KAKAO_APP_KEY` with your actual Kakao app key.

## Step 4: Initialize the SDK

In your main Dart file, initialize the Kakao SDK before using it:

```dart
import 'package:kakao_flutter_sdk_user/kakao_flutter_sdk_user.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await UserApi.instance.initialize();
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 5: Using the Package

You can now use the package to authenticate users and access their profiles. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to log in a user and fetch their profile information.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:kakao_flutter_sdk_user/kakao_flutter_sdk_user.dart';

void main() async {
  // Ensure Flutter binding is initialized
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  // Initialize the Kakao SDK
  await UserApi.instance.initialize();
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Kakao SDK Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  String _userInfo = "User not logged in";

  // Function to handle Kakao login
  Future<void> _loginWithKakao() async {
    try {
      // Trigger the login process
      final authCode = await AuthCodeClient.instance.requestWithTalk();
      // Use the auth code to get the access token
      final token = await AccessTokenApi.instance.issueAccessToken(authCode);
      // Fetch user profile information
      final user = await UserApi.instance.me();
      setState(() {
        _userInfo = "Logged in as: ${user.kakaoAccount?.profile?.nickname}";
      });
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        _userInfo = "Login failed: $e";
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Kakao SDK User Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(_userInfo),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _loginWithKakao,
              child: Text('Login with Kakao'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts by initializing the Kakao SDK in the main function.
// 2. The HomeScreen widget is displayed, showing the current user status.
// 3. When the user presses the "Login with Kakao" button, the _loginWithKakao function is called.
// 4. This function requests an authentication code from KakaoTalk.
// 5. Upon successful login, it retrieves the access token and fetches the user's profile information.
// 6. The user's nickname is displayed on the screen, or an error message if the login fails.
```
