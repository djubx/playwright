# Setting Up and Using `flutter_turtle`

## Installation
To add the `flutter_turtle` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_turtle: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_turtle).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No special configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if you plan to use any features that require user permissions (like accessing the camera or storage).

## Basic Usage
To use the `flutter_turtle` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_turtle/flutter_turtle.dart';
```

You can then create a simple turtle drawing application by using the `Turtle` widget provided by the package. 

Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to set up a turtle:

```dart
Turtle(
  onDraw: (turtle) {
    turtle.forward(100); // Move forward 100 units
    turtle.right(90);    // Turn right 90 degrees
    turtle.forward(100); // Move forward 100 units
  },
)
```

This code snippet will create a turtle that draws a right angle.

With this setup, you are ready to start creating your turtle graphics in Flutter!

# Complete Example of `flutter_turtle`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_turtle/flutter_turtle.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Turtle Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Turtle Drawing'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Turtle(
            onDraw: (turtle) {
              // Set the pen color to blue
              turtle.penColor = Colors.blue;
              // Set the pen width
              turtle.penWidth = 5;

              // Draw a square
              for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
                turtle.forward(100); // Move forward 100 units
                turtle.right(90);    // Turn right 90 degrees
              }

              // Move to a new position without drawing
              turtle.penUp();
              turtle.right(90);    // Turn right 90 degrees
              turtle.forward(150); // Move forward 150 units
              turtle.left(90);     // Turn left 90 degrees
              turtle.penDown();    // Start drawing again

              // Draw a triangle
              for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
                turtle.forward(100); // Move forward 100 units
                turtle.right(120);   // Turn right 120 degrees
              }
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Flutter Turtle Drawing".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers a Turtle widget.
// 5. The Turtle widget's onDraw callback is defined to control the turtle's movements and drawing.
// 6. The turtle first sets its pen color to blue and width to 5.
// 7. It then draws a square by moving forward 100 units and turning right 90 degrees four times.
// 8. After completing the square, the turtle lifts its pen, moves to a new position, and then lowers the pen.
// 9. Finally, it draws a triangle by moving forward 100 units and turning right 120 degrees three times.
