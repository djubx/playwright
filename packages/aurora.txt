# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Aurora Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the Aurora package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the Aurora package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  aurora: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to enable certain capabilities in your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file, depending on the animations you plan to use. For example, if you are using animations that require network access, ensure you have the appropriate permissions set.

## Step 3: Using the Aurora Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a fade-in animation using the Aurora package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:aurora/aurora.dart'; // Import the Aurora package

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Aurora Animation Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: AuroraFadeIn(
            duration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Set the duration of the fade-in
            child: Text(
              'Hello, Aurora!',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that uses the `AuroraFadeIn` widget to animate the appearance of a text widget.

# Complete Example of the Aurora Package

Below is a complete Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the Aurora package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:aurora/aurora.dart'; // Import the Aurora package

// Main class of the application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Aurora Animation Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Using AuroraFadeIn for a fade-in effect
          child: AuroraFadeIn(
            duration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Duration of the fade-in effect
            child: Column(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              children: [
                Text(
                  'Welcome to Aurora!',
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
                ),
                SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between text widgets
                // Using AuroraSlide for a slide-in effect
                AuroraSlideIn(
                  duration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Duration of the slide-in effect
                  child: Text(
                    'Enjoy your animations!',
                    style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
                  ),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
3. Inside the Center widget, we use AuroraFadeIn to create a fade-in effect for the first text widget.
4. After a 2-second duration, the text "Welcome to Aurora!" fades in.
5. Below this text, we have a SizedBox to add some space.
6. We then use AuroraSlideIn to create a slide-in effect for the second text widget.
7. After another 2-second duration, the text "Enjoy your animations!" slides in from the side.
8. The result is a visually appealing animation sequence that enhances the user experience.

In summary, the Aurora package provides a straightforward way to implement beautiful animations in Flutter applications. By following the setup and usage instructions, developers can easily enhance their apps with engaging visual effects, improving overall user interaction and satisfaction.
