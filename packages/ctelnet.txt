# Overview of the ctelnet Flutter Package

The `ctelnet` package is a Flutter library designed to facilitate Telnet communication in your applications. Telnet is a network protocol used to provide a command-line interface for communication with a remote device or server. This package is particularly useful for developers who need to interact with network devices, servers, or any system that supports Telnet.

## When to Use ctelnet

You might consider using the `ctelnet` package in scenarios such as:
- Building network management tools that require remote access to devices.
- Creating applications that need to send commands to servers or network devices.
- Developing educational tools for learning about network protocols and device management.

## Key Features
- **Easy Connection Management**: Simplifies the process of establishing and managing Telnet connections.
- **Command Execution**: Allows sending commands to the remote server and receiving responses.
- **Event Handling**: Provides callbacks for connection events, making it easier to handle connection states.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

# Setting Up and Using ctelnet

## Installation

To add the `ctelnet` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ctelnet: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/ctelnet).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if your application requires network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage

Hereâ€™s how to use the `ctelnet` package in your Flutter application:

1. Import the package:
   ```dart
   import 'package:ctelnet/ctelnet.dart';
   ```

2. Create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class to manage your Telnet connection.

3. Use the provided methods to connect, send commands, and handle responses.

# Complete Example of Using ctelnet

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ctelnet/ctelnet.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late Ctelnet _telnet; // Declare a Telnet instance
  String _response = ''; // Variable to hold the response from the server

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _telnet = Ctelnet(); // Initialize the Telnet instance
    _connectToServer(); // Call the method to connect to the server
  }

  // Method to connect to the Telnet server
  void _connectToServer() async {
    // Attempt to connect to the server
    await _telnet.connect('your.server.address', 23); // Replace with your server address and port
    _telnet.onResponse = (String response) {
      setState(() {
        _response = response; // Update the response variable with the server's response
      });
    };
  }

  // Method to send a command to the server
  void _sendCommand(String command) {
    _telnet.send(command); // Send the command to the server
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Telnet Example')),
        body: Column(
          children: [
            Text('Response from server:'),
            Text(_response), // Display the server's response
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () => _sendCommand('your_command'), // Replace with your command
              child: Text('Send Command'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _telnet.disconnect(); // Disconnect from the server when the widget is disposed
    super.dispose();
  }
}
```

// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application that connects to a Telnet server.
// 1. The `RealFlutter` class is a StatefulWidget that manages the Telnet connection.
// 2. In the `initState` method, we initialize the `Ctelnet` instance and call `_connectToServer` to establish a connection.
// 3. The `_connectToServer` method connects to the specified server and sets up a callback to handle responses.
// 4. The `_sendCommand` method sends a command to the server when the button is pressed.
// 5. The UI displays the server's response and provides a button to send a command.
// 6. Finally, we ensure to disconnect from the server when the widget is disposed to free up resources.
