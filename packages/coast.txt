## Part 3: Complete Example

```markdown
<!-- START_MAIN -->
# Complete Example of Coast Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:coast/coast.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Coast Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate to the DetailScreen with a custom transition
            Navigator.of(context).push(
              CoastPageRoute(
                builder: (context) => DetailScreen(),
                transition: CoastTransition.fade, // Custom transition
              ),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Go to Detail Screen'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DetailScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Detail Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to the Detail Screen!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is displayed as the initial screen.
// 4. The HomeScreen contains a button that, when pressed, triggers navigation to the DetailScreen.
// 5. The CoastPageRoute is used to navigate, applying a custom fade transition.
// 6. The DetailScreen is displayed, showing a simple message.
```
