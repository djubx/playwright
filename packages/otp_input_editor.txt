- You want a customizable and user-friendly input field for entering OTPs.
- You are looking for a solution that enhances user experience by providing a seamless input method.

## Key Features
- **Customizable UI**: The package allows developers to customize the appearance of the OTP input fields to match the app's design.
- **Focus Management**: Automatically moves focus to the next input field after entering a digit, improving user experience.
- **Error Handling**: Provides built-in error handling for invalid inputs.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using otp_input_editor

## Installation
To use the `otp_input_editor` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  otp_input_editor: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable the appropriate permissions in your `Info.plist` file if your app requires network access for OTP verification.

## Basic Usage
To use the `otp_input_editor`, you can create a simple widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:otp_input_editor/otp_input_editor.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('OTP Input Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: OtpInput(
            length: 6, // Number of OTP digits
            onCompleted: (String value) {
              // Handle the completed OTP input
              print("OTP Entered: $value");
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with an OTP input field. The `onCompleted` callback is triggered when the user has entered all the digits.

# Complete Example of otp_input_editor

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:otp_input_editor/otp_input_editor.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('OTP Input Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: OtpInput(
            length: 6, // Set the length of the OTP
            onCompleted: (String value) {
              // This callback is called when the user has entered all digits
              print("OTP Entered: $value");
              // Here you can add your logic to verify the OTP
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds the OtpInput.
// 4. The OtpInput is configured to accept 6 digits.
// 5. When the user completes the OTP input, the onCompleted callback is triggered.
// 6. Inside the callback, the entered OTP is printed to the console, where you can add your verification logic.
