# flutter_polygon_clipper: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with `flutter_polygon_clipper`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_polygon_clipper: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 9.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
```

## Usage
To use the `flutter_polygon_clipper`, you can wrap any widget with the `ClipPath` widget and provide a custom `PolygonClipper`. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_polygon_clipper/flutter_polygon_clipper.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Polygon Clipper Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ClipPath(
          clipper: PolygonClipper(sides: 5, radius: 100),
          child: Container(
            color: Colors.blue,
            height: 200,
            width: 200,
            child: Center(child: Text('Polygon Shape', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white))),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to create a pentagon-shaped container with a blue background and centered text.

# Complete Example of flutter_polygon_clipper

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_polygon_clipper/flutter_polygon_clipper.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Polygon Clipper Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Polygon Clipper Example')),
      body: Center(
        // Using ClipPath to create a polygon shape
        child: ClipPath(
          // Specifying the number of sides and radius for the polygon
          clipper: PolygonClipper(sides: 6, radius: 100),
          child: Container(
            // Setting the background color of the polygon
            color: Colors.green,
            height: 200,
            width: 200,
            // Centering the text inside the polygon
            child: Center(
              child: Text(
                'Hexagon Shape',
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with MyApp().
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and home widget.
// 3. The home widget is RealFlutter, which contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a ClipPath is used to create a polygon shape using PolygonClipper.
// 5. The PolygonClipper is configured to create a hexagon with a specified radius.
// 6. A Container is used to fill the polygon shape with a green color and display centered text.
// 7. The text "Hexagon Shape" is displayed in white color, making it stand out against the green background.
