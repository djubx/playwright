# Understanding the "strict" Flutter Package

The "strict" Flutter package is designed to enhance type safety and enforce stricter coding practices in Flutter applications. It provides developers with tools to ensure that their code adheres to defined types and structures, reducing runtime errors and improving code maintainability. 

## When to Use "strict"

- **Type Safety**: When you want to enforce strict type checking in your Flutter application.
- **Code Quality**: If you are working in a team and want to maintain high code quality standards.
- **Error Reduction**: To minimize runtime errors caused by type mismatches.

## Key Features

- **Type Enforcement**: Ensures that variables and function parameters are strictly typed.
- **Compile-Time Checks**: Catches type-related errors at compile time rather than at runtime.
- **Improved Readability**: Makes the code more readable and understandable by clearly defining types.

By integrating the "strict" package into your Flutter project, you can create more robust applications that are easier to maintain and less prone to errors.

# Setting Up the "strict" Package

To get started with the "strict" package, follow these steps:

## Installation

1. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file.
2. Add the "strict" package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     strict: ^latest_version
   ```

3. Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

- Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file to avoid compatibility issues.

### iOS

- No specific configurations are required for iOS, but ensure that your Xcode is updated to the latest version for optimal performance.

## Basic Configuration

After installation, you can start using the "strict" package in your Dart files. Import the package at the top of your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:strict/strict.dart';
```

Now you can begin to define your types and use the features provided by the package.

# Complete Example of Using the "strict" Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:strict/strict.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Strict Package Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Strict Package Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: StrictExample(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class StrictExample extends StatelessWidget {
  // A method that takes a strictly typed parameter
  void displayMessage(String message) {
    // This will enforce that 'message' is always a String
    print(message);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Calling the displayMessage method with a strictly typed argument
    displayMessage("Hello, Strict Package!");

    return Text(
      'Check your console for the message!',
      style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, we instantiate StrictExample.
// 5. In StrictExample, we define a method displayMessage that takes a String parameter.
// 6. We call displayMessage with a String, which is enforced by the strict package.
// 7. The message is printed to the console, and a Text widget is displayed in the center of the screen.
```
<!-- END_MAIN -->
```

### Summary of Application Flow
The application starts with the `main` function, which initializes the `RealFlutter` widget. This widget sets up a basic Material app structure with an AppBar and a centered message. The `StrictExample` widget demonstrates the use of the "strict" package by enforcing type safety through the `displayMessage` method, which only accepts a String argument. The message is printed to the console, showcasing the package's functionality while providing user feedback through the UI.
