Here's a detailed technical blog on the "cli_util" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Description

The `cli_util` package is a powerful utility for Flutter developers that simplifies the process of creating command-line interfaces (CLI) for Dart applications. It provides a set of tools that help in managing command-line arguments, displaying help messages, and handling various CLI-related tasks efficiently.

## When to Use `cli_util`

You should consider using the `cli_util` package when:
- You are developing a Dart application that requires a command-line interface.
- You need to parse command-line arguments easily and efficiently.
- You want to provide users with helpful command-line options and usage instructions.

## Features

- **Argument Parsing**: Easily parse command-line arguments with built-in support for options and flags.
- **Help Messages**: Automatically generate help messages based on the defined commands and options.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms, making it versatile for mobile and server-side applications.

## Example Use Cases

1. **CLI Tools**: If you are building a CLI tool for data processing or automation, `cli_util` can help you manage user inputs effectively.
2. **Scripts**: For scripts that require user interaction via the command line, this package simplifies argument handling and user guidance.

# Tutorial

## Setup Process

To get started with the `cli_util` package, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `cli_util` package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     cli_util: ^0.3.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions if your CLI tool interacts with device features.
   - **iOS**: Update your `Info.plist` file if you need to access specific iOS features.

## Using the Package

### Basic Usage

Here’s how to use the `cli_util` package in your Flutter application:

1. **Import the Package**:

   ```dart
   import 'package:cli_util/cli_util.dart';
   ```

2. **Create a Main Class**: Define your main class, for example, `RealFlutter`, and set up the command-line interface.

3. **Parse Arguments**: Use the `CommandLine` class to parse and handle command-line arguments.

### Example Code Snippet

Here’s a simple example of how to set up a command-line interface using `cli_util`:

```dart
import 'package:cli_util/cli_util.dart';

class RealFlutter {
  void run(List<String> args) {
    // Parse command-line arguments
    var command = args.isNotEmpty ? args[0] : 'help';

    switch (command) {
      case 'help':
        print('Usage: real_flutter [command]');
        print('Commands:');
        print('  help     Show help information');
        print('  version  Show version information');
        break;
      case 'version':
        print('RealFlutter version 1.0.0');
        break;
      default:
        print('Unknown command: $command');
        break;
    }
  }
}

void main(List<String> args) {
  var app = RealFlutter();
  app.run(args);
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

- The `RealFlutter` class contains a `run` method that takes a list of command-line arguments.
- It checks if any arguments are provided; if not, it defaults to the `help` command.
- Based on the command, it prints the appropriate message to the console.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:cli_util/cli_util.dart'; // Import the cli_util package

class RealFlutter {
  // Main method to run the CLI application
  void run(List<String> args) {
    // Check if any command-line arguments are provided
    var command = args.isNotEmpty ? args[0] : 'help';

    // Switch case to handle different commands
    switch (command) {
      case 'help':
        // Display help information
        print('Usage: real_flutter [command]');
        print('Commands:');
        print('  help     Show help information');
        print('  version  Show version information');
        break;
      case 'version':
        // Display version information
        print('RealFlutter version 1.0.0');
        break;
      default:
        // Handle unknown commands
        print('Unknown command: $command');
        break;
    }
  }
}

void main(List<String> args) {
  var app = RealFlutter(); // Create an instance of RealFlutter
  app.run(args); // Run the application with command-line arguments
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts by importing the cli_util package.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is defined with a run method that processes command-line arguments.
// 3. The main function creates an instance of RealFlutter and calls the run method with the provided arguments.
// 4. Depending on the command entered (help or version), the application displays the corresponding information.
// 5. If an unknown command is entered, it notifies the user of the unknown command.
