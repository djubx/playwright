# Cached Chewie Plus: A Flutter Package for Efficient Video Playback

The `cached_chewie_plus` package is an extension of the popular `chewie` package, which provides a customizable video player for Flutter applications. This package adds caching capabilities, allowing for smoother video playback by storing video files locally. This is particularly useful for applications that require offline access to videos or for reducing data usage when streaming.

## When to Use `cached_chewie_plus`
- **Offline Video Playback**: If your app needs to play videos without an internet connection, caching is essential.
- **Data Usage Management**: For apps that stream videos, caching can help minimize data consumption by storing frequently accessed videos.
- **Improved User Experience**: By reducing buffering times, cached videos can enhance the overall user experience.

## Key Features
- **Caching Mechanism**: Automatically caches video files for offline playback.
- **Customizable UI**: Leverages the `chewie` package's customizable player controls.
- **Support for Multiple Formats**: Handles various video formats, ensuring compatibility across different devices.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that integrates seamlessly with existing Flutter applications.

Overall, `cached_chewie_plus` is an excellent choice for developers looking to implement efficient video playback in their Flutter apps.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Cached Chewie Plus

## Installation
To use `cached_chewie_plus`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cached_chewie_plus: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/cached_chewie_plus).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to access the internet and read external storage. Add the following lines inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file to allow access to the internet. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
To use `cached_chewie_plus`, you can create a simple video player widget. Hereâ€™s how to implement it in your Flutter application:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cached_chewie_plus/cached_chewie_plus.dart';
import 'package:video_player/video_player.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // URL of the video to be played
    final videoUrl = 'https://www.example.com/video.mp4';

    // Create a VideoPlayerController
    final videoPlayerController = VideoPlayerController.network(videoUrl);

    // Create a CachedChewieController
    final cachedChewieController = CachedChewieController(
      videoPlayerController: videoPlayerController,
      aspectRatio: 16 / 9,
      autoPlay: true,
      looping: true,
    );

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Cached Chewie Plus Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: CachedChewie(
          controller: cachedChewieController,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic video player using `cached_chewie_plus`. The video will automatically play and loop.

# Complete Example of Cached Chewie Plus

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cached_chewie_plus/cached_chewie_plus.dart';
import 'package:video_player/video_player.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // URL of the video to be played
    final videoUrl = 'https://www.example.com/video.mp4';

    // Create a VideoPlayerController
    final videoPlayerController = VideoPlayerController.network(videoUrl);

    // Create a CachedChewieController
    final cachedChewieController = CachedChewieController(
      videoPlayerController: videoPlayerController,
      aspectRatio: 16 / 9, // Set the aspect ratio for the video
      autoPlay: true, // Automatically play the video
      looping: true, // Loop the video
    );

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Cached Chewie Plus Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: CachedChewie(
            controller: cachedChewieController, // Use the CachedChewie widget
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is built, which contains the video player.
// 3. A VideoPlayerController is created using a network URL for the video.
// 4. A CachedChewieController is created, which wraps the VideoPlayerController.
// 5. The CachedChewie widget is used to display the video player in the UI.
// 6. The video is set to autoplay and loop, providing a seamless viewing experience.
