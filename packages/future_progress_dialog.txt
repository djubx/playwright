Here's a detailed technical blog on the "future_progress_dialog" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Future Progress Dialog Flutter Package

The `future_progress_dialog` package is a Flutter library designed to simplify the process of displaying progress dialogs while waiting for asynchronous operations to complete. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to inform users that a task is in progress, such as data fetching, file uploads, or any long-running operations.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `future_progress_dialog` package in the following scenarios:

- **Data Fetching**: When retrieving data from an API, showing a progress dialog can enhance user experience by indicating that the app is working on fetching data.
- **File Uploads**: For applications that allow users to upload files, displaying a progress dialog can inform users about the upload status.
- **Long-Running Tasks**: Any operation that takes a noticeable amount of time should ideally have a progress indicator to keep users informed.

## Features

- **Easy Integration**: The package is straightforward to integrate into existing Flutter applications.
- **Customizable Dialogs**: You can customize the appearance and behavior of the progress dialog to fit your app's design.
- **Future Handling**: It seamlessly integrates with Dart's `Future` API, allowing you to show the dialog while waiting for a future to complete.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Future Progress Dialog

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `future_progress_dialog` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  future_progress_dialog: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install it.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

To use the `future_progress_dialog`, you can wrap your asynchronous function call with the dialog. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:future_progress_dialog/future_progress_dialog.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Future Progress Dialog Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Show the progress dialog while the future is being executed
              await showDialog(
                context: context,
                builder: (context) => FutureProgressDialog(
                  _longRunningTask(),
                  message: Text('Loading...'),
                ),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Start Task'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  Future<void> _longRunningTask() async {
    // Simulate a long-running task
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3));
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, a progress dialog appears while the `_longRunningTask` function simulates a delay of 3 seconds.

# Complete Example of Future Progress Dialog

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:future_progress_dialog/future_progress_dialog.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Future Progress Dialog Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Show the progress dialog while the future is being executed
              await showDialog(
                context: context,
                builder: (context) => FutureProgressDialog(
                  _longRunningTask(), // Call the long-running task
                  message: Text('Loading...'), // Message displayed in the dialog
                ),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Start Task'), // Button to start the task
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  Future<void> _longRunningTask() async {
    // Simulate a long-running task
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3)); // Wait for 3 seconds
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The main screen displays a button labeled "Start Task."
// 3. When the button is pressed, the onPressed callback is triggered.
// 4. Inside the callback, a progress dialog is shown using showDialog.
// 5. The FutureProgressDialog is created, which takes a Future (in this case, _longRunningTask()).
// 6. The dialog displays a loading message while the future is being executed.
// 7. The _longRunningTask simulates a delay of 3 seconds.
// 8. Once the task is complete, the dialog automatically closes, and the user can continue using the app.
```

In summary, the `future_progress_dialog` package provides a simple and effective way to manage progress dialogs in Flutter applications. By following the steps outlined in this blog, you can easily integrate this package into your projects, enhancing the user experience during asynchronous operations.
