# Cobertura Flutter Package: Overview
=====================================

The Cobertura Flutter package is a code coverage tool that helps developers measure the effectiveness of their tests. It provides a detailed report on which lines of code are executed during testing, allowing developers to identify areas that need more testing.

### When to Use Cobertura

Cobertura is useful in the following scenarios:

*   To measure the effectiveness of unit tests, widget tests, and integration tests.
*   To identify areas of the code that are not adequately tested.
*   To ensure that new code changes are thoroughly tested.

### Features of Cobertura

Some of the key features of Cobertura include:

*   **Line coverage**: Measures the percentage of lines of code that are executed during testing.
*   **Branch coverage**: Measures the percentage of branches (e.g., if-else statements) that are executed during testing.
*   **Method coverage**: Measures the percentage of methods that are executed during testing.
*   **Class coverage**: Measures the percentage of classes that are executed during testing.
*   **Report generation**: Generates a detailed report in HTML, XML, or CSV format.

# Cobertura Flutter Package: Tutorial
=====================================

This tutorial will guide you through the setup process and explain how to use the Cobertura Flutter package.

### Step 1: Add the Cobertura Package to Your Project

Add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dev_dependencies:
  cobertura: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Configure Cobertura

Create a new file called `cobertura.yaml` in the root of your project with the following configuration:

```yml
 cobertura:
   report_format: html
   output_directory: coverage
```

This configuration tells Cobertura to generate an HTML report and save it in the `coverage` directory.

### Step 3: Run Cobertura

To run Cobertura, use the following command:

```bash
flutter pub run cobertura
```

This will execute your tests and generate a coverage report.

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

To use Cobertura on Android, you need to add the following configuration to your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    testOptions {
        unitTests.includeAndroidResources = true
    }
}
```

#### iOS

To use Cobertura on iOS, you need to add the following configuration to your `ios/Podfile` file:

```ruby
target 'YourApp' do
  pod 'cobertura'
end
```

Then, run `pod install` to install the Cobertura pod.

```dart
// Import the Cobertura package
import 'package:cobertura/cobertura.dart';

// Import the Flutter test package
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';

// Import the RealFlutter class
import 'package:your_app/real_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  // Create a new instance of the RealFlutter class
  RealFlutter realFlutter = RealFlutter();

  // Define a test for the RealFlutter class
  test('RealFlutter test', () {
    // Call the doSomething method on the RealFlutter instance
    realFlutter.doSomething();
  });

  // Run Cobertura to generate a coverage report
  Cobertura.run();
}

// Define the RealFlutter class
class RealFlutter {
  // Define the doSomething method
  void doSomething() {
    // Do something
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The main function is called, which creates a new instance of the RealFlutter class.
// 2. The test function is called, which calls the doSomething method on the RealFlutter instance.
// 3. The doSomething method is executed, which does something.
// 4. The Cobertura.run method is called, which generates a coverage report.
// The coverage report will show which lines of code were executed during the test.
```
The final summary is that the code flows as follows:

*   The `main` function is called, which creates a new instance of the `RealFlutter` class.
*   The `test` function is called, which calls the `doSomething` method on the `RealFlutter` instance.
*   The `doSomething` method is executed, which does something.
*   The `Cobertura.run` method is called, which generates a coverage report.
