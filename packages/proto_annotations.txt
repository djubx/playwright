# Overview of the proto_annotations Flutter Package

The `proto_annotations` package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who want to leverage protocol buffers (protobuf) in their applications. This package simplifies the process of defining and using protobuf messages in Dart, making it easier to serialize and deserialize data structures efficiently.

## When to Use `proto_annotations`

You should consider using `proto_annotations` when:
- You need to communicate with a backend service that uses protocol buffers for data interchange.
- You want to define complex data structures in a type-safe manner.
- You are looking for a way to reduce boilerplate code associated with data serialization.

## Key Features
- **Annotation-based Code Generation**: The package uses Dart's annotation system to generate code for protobuf messages automatically.
- **Type Safety**: Ensures that the data structures are type-checked at compile time, reducing runtime errors.
- **Integration with Protobuf**: Seamlessly integrates with the protobuf ecosystem, allowing for easy serialization and deserialization of data.
- **Support for Nested Messages**: Allows for the definition of complex, nested data structures.

By using `proto_annotations`, developers can focus on building their applications without worrying about the intricacies of data serialization.

# Setting Up and Using proto_annotations

## Installation

To get started with `proto_annotations`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  proto_annotations: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/proto_annotations).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       compileOptions {
           sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
           targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Podfile` and ensure that the platform is set to at least 10.0:
   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

## Using the Package

1. Create a Dart file for your protobuf definitions, for example, `message.proto.dart`.
2. Define your messages using annotations provided by `proto_annotations`.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to define a message:

```dart
import 'package:proto_annotations/proto_annotations.dart';

part 'message.proto.g.dart';

@ProtoMessage()
class RealFlutter {
  @ProtoField(1)
  String name;

  @ProtoField(2)
  int age;

  RealFlutter({required this.name, required this.age});
}
```

3. Run the build command to generate the necessary code:
   ```bash
   flutter pub run build_runner build
   ```

This command will generate the `message.proto.g.dart` file containing the serialization logic for your `RealFlutter` class.

# Complete Example of Using proto_annotations

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:proto_annotations/proto_annotations.dart';

// Import the generated protobuf file
part 'message.proto.g.dart';

// Define the RealFlutter class with protobuf annotations
@ProtoMessage()
class RealFlutter {
  @ProtoField(1)
  String name;

  @ProtoField(2)
  int age;

  RealFlutter({required this.name, required this.age});
}

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Proto Annotations Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Proto Annotations Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Create an instance of RealFlutter
              RealFlutter person = RealFlutter(name: 'John Doe', age: 30);
              
              // Serialize the object to bytes
              final bytes = person.writeToBuffer();
              
              // Deserialize the bytes back to an object
              RealFlutter newPerson = RealFlutter.fromBuffer(bytes);
              
              // Display the deserialized object
              print('Name: ${newPerson.name}, Age: ${newPerson.age}');
            },
            child: Text('Serialize and Deserialize'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget with a button.
// 4. When the button is pressed, a RealFlutter object is created with a name and age.
// 5. The object is serialized to bytes using the writeToBuffer method.
// 6. The bytes are then deserialized back into a new RealFlutter object.
// 7. Finally, the name and age of the new object are printed to the console.
