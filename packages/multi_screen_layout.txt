The `multi_screen_layout` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to create responsive and adaptive layouts that can seamlessly transition between different screen sizes and orientations. This package is particularly useful for applications that need to support multiple platforms, such as mobile and web, or for those that require a dynamic layout that adjusts based on the user's device.

## When to Use `multi_screen_layout`

- **Responsive Design**: When building applications that need to look good on both small and large screens.

- **Dynamic Content**: When the content of the app changes based on user interactions or data.

## Key Features

- **Flexible Layouts**: Easily create layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.
- **Orientation Handling**: Automatically adjust layouts based on the device's orientation.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `multi_screen_layout`

## Installation

To get started with the `multi_screen_layout` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  multi_screen_layout: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/multi_screen_layout).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage

To use the `multi_screen_layout` package, you can start by importing it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:multi_screen_layout/multi_screen_layout.dart';
```

You can then create a layout that adapts to different screen sizes using the `MultiScreenLayout` widget. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
MultiScreenLayout(
  mobile: MobileLayout(),
  tablet: TabletLayout(),
  desktop: DesktopLayout(),
);
```

In this example, `MobileLayout`, `TabletLayout`, and `DesktopLayout` are custom widgets that you define for each screen size.

### Example Layouts

You can define your layouts as follows:

```dart
class MobileLayout extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Mobile Layout')),
      body: Center(child: Text('This is a mobile layout')),
    );
  }
}

class TabletLayout extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Tablet Layout')),
      body: Center(child: Text('This is a tablet layout')),
    );
  }
}

class DesktopLayout extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Desktop Layout')),
      body: Center(child: Text('This is a desktop layout')),
    );
  }
}
```

With this setup, your application will automatically choose the appropriate layout based on the device's screen size.

# Complete Example of `multi_screen_layout`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:multi_screen_layout/multi_screen_layout.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Multi Screen Layout Example',
      home: MultiScreenLayout(
        mobile: MobileLayout(), // Mobile layout for small screens
        tablet: TabletLayout(), // Tablet layout for medium screens
        desktop: DesktopLayout(), // Desktop layout for large screens
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Mobile layout widget
class MobileLayout extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Mobile Layout')),
      body: Center(child: Text('This is a mobile layout')),
    );
  }
}

// Tablet layout widget
class TabletLayout extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Tablet Layout')),
      body: Center(child: Text('This is a tablet layout')),
    );
  }
}

// Desktop layout widget
class DesktopLayout extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Desktop Layout')),
      body: Center(child: Text('This is a desktop layout')),
    );
  }
}

/*
The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
Inside RealFlutter, we set up a MaterialApp with a title and a home property.
The home property uses the MultiScreenLayout widget to determine which layout to display based on the screen size.
- For mobile devices, the MobileLayout widget is displayed.
- For tablet devices, the TabletLayout widget is displayed.
- For desktop devices, the DesktopLayout widget is displayed.

Each layout widget contains a simple Scaffold with an AppBar and a centered text widget indicating which layout is currently being displayed.
This structure allows for a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes seamlessly.
