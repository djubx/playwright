# Complete Example of flutter_check_box_rounded

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_check_box_rounded/flutter_check_box_rounded.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to hold the checkbox state
  bool isChecked = false;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Rounded Checkbox Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying the rounded checkbox
              CheckBoxRounded(
                value: isChecked, // Current state of the checkbox
                onChanged: (bool? newValue) {
                  // Updating the state when the checkbox is tapped
                  setState(() {
                    isChecked = newValue!;
                  });
                },
                activeColor: Colors.blue, // Color when checked
                checkColor: Colors.white, // Color of the check mark
                shape: BoxShape.circle, // Shape of the checkbox
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between elements
              // Displaying the current state
              Text(
                isChecked ? 'Checked' : 'Unchecked',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the checkbox.
// 3. The _RealFlutterState class contains a boolean variable 'isChecked' to track the checkbox state.
// 4. In the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the checkbox and text vertically.
// 6. The CheckBoxRounded widget is created with properties for value, onChanged callback, active color, check color, and shape.
// 7. When the checkbox is tapped, the onChanged callback updates the 'isChecked' state, triggering a rebuild.
// 8. The Text widget displays the current state of the checkbox, updating dynamically based on user interaction.
