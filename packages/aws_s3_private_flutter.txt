# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using aws_s3_private_flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `aws_s3_private_flutter` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `aws_s3_private_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  aws_s3_private_flutter: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Configure AWS Credentials

You need to configure your AWS credentials to allow your Flutter app to access your S3 bucket. Create a new IAM user in the AWS Management Console with permissions to access S3. Note down the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and add the following permissions:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. Ensure you have the latest version of Xcode and your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0.

## Step 4: Initialize the Package

In your Flutter application, initialize the package with your AWS credentials:

```dart
import 'package:aws_s3_private_flutter/aws_s3_private_flutter.dart';

final s3 = RealFlutter(
  region: 'your-region', // e.g., 'us-east-1'
  bucketId: 'your-bucket-id',
  accessKey: 'your-access-key',
  secretKey: 'your-secret-key',
);
```

## Step 5: Using the Package

You can now use the package to upload and download files. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
// Upload a file
await s3.uploadFile(filePath: 'path/to/your/file.txt', fileName: 'file.txt');

// Download a file
await s3.downloadFile(fileName: 'file.txt', destinationPath: 'path/to/save/file.txt');
```

With these steps, you have successfully set up and configured the `aws_s3_private_flutter` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of aws_s3_private_flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:aws_s3_private_flutter/aws_s3_private_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'AWS S3 Private Flutter Example',
      home: S3Example(),
    );
  }
}

class S3Example extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _S3ExampleState createState() => _S3ExampleState();
}

class _S3ExampleState extends State<S3Example> {
  final s3 = RealFlutter(
    region: 'your-region', // e.g., 'us-east-1'
    bucketId: 'your-bucket-id',
    accessKey: 'your-access-key',
    secretKey: 'your-secret-key',
  );

  String statusMessage = '';

  // Function to upload a file
  Future<void> uploadFile() async {
    try {
      await s3.uploadFile(filePath: 'path/to/your/file.txt', fileName: 'file.txt');
      setState(() {
        statusMessage = 'File uploaded successfully!';
      });
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        statusMessage = 'Upload failed: $e';
      });
    }
  }

  // Function to download a file
  Future<void> downloadFile() async {
    try {
      await s3.downloadFile(fileName: 'file.txt', destinationPath: 'path/to/save/file.txt');
      setState(() {
        statusMessage = 'File downloaded successfully!';
      });
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        statusMessage = 'Download failed: $e';
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('AWS S3 Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: uploadFile,
              child: Text('Upload File'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: downloadFile,
              child: Text('Download File'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(statusMessage),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The S3Example widget is created, which initializes the RealFlutter instance with AWS credentials.
// 3. Two buttons are provided: one for uploading a file and another for downloading a file.
// 4. When the upload button is pressed, the uploadFile function is called, which attempts to upload a specified file to S3.
// 5. If the upload is successful, a success message is displayed; otherwise, an error message is shown.
// 6. Similarly, pressing the download button calls the downloadFile function, which attempts to download a file from S3.
// 7. The status message is updated based on the success or failure of the operations.
```
