# Tutorial: Setting Up the WireGuard VPN Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `wireguard_vpn` package and explain how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `wireguard_vpn` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  wireguard_vpn: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BIND_VPN_SERVICE"/>
   ```

2. **Minimum SDK Version**: Ensure your `build.gradle` file has a minimum SDK version of at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open your `Info.plist` file and add the following:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. **Capabilities**: Enable the "Personal VPN" capability in your Xcode project settings.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have configured the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to establish a VPN connection.

# Complete Example of Using the WireGuard VPN Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:wireguard_vpn/wireguard_vpn.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Declare a variable to hold the VPN connection status
  bool isConnected = false;

  // Function to start the VPN connection
  Future<void> connectVPN() async {
    try {
      // Create a configuration for the VPN
      final config = WireGuardConfig(
        privateKey: 'YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY',
        publicKey: 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY',
        endpoint: 'YOUR_VPN_SERVER:51820',
        allowedIPs: ['0.0.0.0/0'], // Route all traffic through the VPN
      );

      // Start the VPN connection
      await WireGuardVpn.start(config);
      setState(() {
        isConnected = true; // Update the connection status
      });
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error connecting to VPN: $e'); // Handle any errors
    }
  }

  // Function to stop the VPN connection
  Future<void> disconnectVPN() async {
    try {
      await WireGuardVpn.stop(); // Stop the VPN connection
      setState(() {
        isConnected = false; // Update the connection status
      });
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error disconnecting from VPN: $e'); // Handle any errors
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('WireGuard VPN Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              Text(
                isConnected ? 'Connected to VPN' : 'Disconnected from VPN',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: isConnected ? disconnectVPN : connectVPN,
                child: Text(isConnected ? 'Disconnect' : 'Connect'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget maintains the VPN connection status in the isConnected variable.
// 3. The connectVPN function creates a WireGuard configuration and starts the VPN connection.
// 4. The disconnectVPN function stops the VPN connection.
// 5. The UI displays the current connection status and provides a button to connect or disconnect from the VPN.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application that allows users to connect and disconnect from a WireGuard VPN. The application flow is straightforward:
- The app initializes and displays the current VPN connection status.
- Users can tap the button to connect or disconnect from the VPN.
- The connection status is updated based on the user's actions.

This example demonstrates the core functionality of the `wireguard_vpn` package, showcasing how to manage VPN connections effectively in a Flutter application.
