# Dart Debouncer: A Flutter Package for Efficient Event Handling

The `dart_debouncer` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to manage event handling efficiently. It helps in reducing the frequency of function calls, particularly in scenarios where rapid events can lead to performance issues or unnecessary processing. This package is particularly useful in situations like:

- **Search Input**: When users type in a search box, you may want to wait until they stop typing before sending a request to fetch results.
- **Button Clicks**: Preventing multiple submissions of a form when a button is clicked multiple times in quick succession.
- **Window Resize Events**: Handling resize events in a responsive design without overwhelming the application with too many updates.

### Features
- **Customizable Delay**: You can set a delay time for the debouncer, allowing you to control how long to wait before executing the function.
- **Immediate Execution**: Optionally, you can execute the function immediately on the first call, which is useful in certain scenarios.
- **Simple API**: The package provides a straightforward API that integrates seamlessly with Flutter applications.

In summary, the `dart_debouncer` package is an essential tool for managing rapid events in Flutter applications, ensuring that your app remains responsive and efficient.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Dart Debouncer

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started with the `dart_debouncer` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dart_debouncer: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:dart_debouncer/dart_debouncer.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Debouncer
You can create an instance of the `Debouncer` class and use it to debounce your function calls. Hereâ€™s how to set it up:

```dart
// Create a Debouncer instance with a delay of 500 milliseconds
final debouncer = Debouncer(delay: Duration(milliseconds: 500));

// Function to be debounced
void search(String query) {
  print('Searching for: $query');
}

// Using the debouncer
void onSearchChanged(String query) {
  debouncer.run(() => search(query));
}
```

### Platform-Specific Details
- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid compatibility issues.
- **iOS**: No specific configurations are required, but ensure that your iOS deployment target is set appropriately in `ios/Podfile`.

### Optimizations
- Use the `Debouncer` in conjunction with state management solutions like Provider or Riverpod to manage the state of your application effectively.
- Consider using the `immediate` parameter of the `Debouncer` if you want the function to execute immediately on the first call.

With these steps, you are now ready to implement the `dart_debouncer` package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example: Using Dart Debouncer in a Flutter App

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dart_debouncer/dart_debouncer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dart Debouncer Example',
      home: SearchPage(),
    );
  }
}

class SearchPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SearchPageState createState() => _SearchPageState();
}

class _SearchPageState extends State<SearchPage> {
  final debouncer = Debouncer(delay: Duration(milliseconds: 500)); // Create a debouncer with a 500ms delay
  String searchQuery = ''; // Variable to hold the search query

  // Function to simulate a search operation
  void search(String query) {
    print('Searching for: $query'); // Print the search query to the console
  }

  // Function to handle changes in the search input
  void onSearchChanged(String query) {
    setState(() {
      searchQuery = query; // Update the search query state
    });
    debouncer.run(() => search(query)); // Run the debouncer with the search function
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Dart Debouncer Example'), // App title
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              onChanged: onSearchChanged, // Call onSearchChanged on input change
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Search',
                border: OutlineInputBorder(),
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text('Searching for: $searchQuery'), // Display the current search query
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The SearchPage widget is displayed, containing a TextField for user input.
// 3. When the user types in the TextField, the onSearchChanged function is called.
// 4. The debouncer waits for 500 milliseconds after the last input before calling the search function.
// 5. The search function prints the current search query to the console.
// 6. The current search query is also displayed on the screen, updating in real-time as the user types.
```

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the `dart_debouncer` package. The application features a search input field where user input is debounced, preventing excessive function calls while typing. The comments within the code explain each part of the application flow, ensuring clarity on how the debouncer works in practice. 

In summary, the `dart_debouncer` package is a valuable addition to any Flutter developer's toolkit, providing an efficient way to handle rapid events and improve application performance.
