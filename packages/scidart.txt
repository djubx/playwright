# Overview of the `scidart` Flutter Package

The `scidart` package is a powerful library designed for scientific computing in Dart, the language behind Flutter. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools for numerical analysis, data manipulation, and scientific computation, making it an excellent choice for developers working on applications that require complex mathematical operations.

## When to Use `scidart`

- **Data Analysis**: If your application involves processing and analyzing large datasets, `scidart` offers efficient data structures and algorithms to handle such tasks.
- **Signal Processing**: For applications that require signal processing capabilities, such as audio analysis or sensor data processing, `scidart` provides a range of functions to perform Fourier transforms, filtering, and more.
- **Mathematical Modeling**: Use `scidart` for applications that involve mathematical modeling and simulations, as it includes a variety of mathematical functions and utilities.

## Key Features

- **Matrix and Vector Operations**: Perform complex matrix and vector calculations with ease.
- **Signal Processing Tools**: Includes functions for Fourier transforms, convolution, and filtering.
- **Statistical Functions**: Offers a range of statistical tools for data analysis.
- **Numerical Methods**: Provides methods for solving equations, optimization, and interpolation.

# Setting Up and Using the `scidart` Package

In this section, we'll walk through the setup process for the `scidart` package and demonstrate how to integrate it into a Flutter project. We'll cover platform-specific details for both Android and iOS.

## Setup Process

1. **Add Dependency**: First, add `scidart` to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     scidart: ^0.0.1  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run the following command to install the package:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configurations**:
   - **Android**: Ensure your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:
     ```gradle
     defaultConfig {
         minSdkVersion 21
     }
     ```
   - **iOS**: Make sure your `ios/Podfile` has platform set to 11.0 or higher:
     ```ruby
     platform :ios, '11.0'
     ```

## Using `scidart` in Your Project

To use `scidart`, import it into your Dart files where needed:
```dart
import 'package:scidart/scidart.dart';
```

### Example Usage

Here's a simple example of performing a Fourier transform using `scidart`:

```dart
import 'package:scidart/scidart.dart';

void main() {
  var signal = Array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]);
  var fft = FFT().fft(signal);
  print(fft);
}
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to perform a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on a simple signal array.

# Complete Example: Flutter Application Using `scidart`

Below is a complete Flutter application that demonstrates the key features of the `scidart` package. This example will show how to perform matrix operations and signal processing within a Flutter app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:scidart/scidart.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutterApp());
}

class RealFlutterApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'SciDart Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomePageState createState() => _HomePageState();
}

class _HomePageState extends State<HomePage> {
  String _result = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _performCalculations();
  }

  void _performCalculations() {
    // Create a matrix
    var matrixA = Matrix([
      [1.0, 2.0],
      [3.0, 4.0]
    ]);

    // Perform matrix multiplication
    var matrixB = matrixA * matrixA;

    // Create a signal array
    var signal = Array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]);

    // Perform FFT on the signal
    var fftResult = FFT().fft(signal);

    // Update the result string
    setState(() {
      _result = 'Matrix B:\n$matrixB\n\nFFT Result:\n$fftResult';
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('SciDart Demo'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Text(
          _result,
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code defines a simple Flutter application that uses the `scidart` package.
// The `RealFlutterApp` class is the main entry point of the application, setting up the MaterialApp.
// The `HomePage` widget is a stateful widget that performs scientific calculations using `scidart`.
// In the `_performCalculations` method, we create a matrix and perform matrix multiplication.
// We also create a signal array and perform a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on it.
// The results of these calculations are displayed in the app's UI.
