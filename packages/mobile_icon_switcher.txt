// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user opens the app, and the `mobile_icon_switcher` package is initialized.
// 2. The user clicks the "Switch Icon" button, which calls the `switchIcon` method of the `MobileIconSwitcher` instance.
// 3. The `switchIcon` method switches the app icon to the specified icon.
// 4. The user can see the new app icon on their device.

// Note: Make sure to replace `'new_icon'` with the actual name of the icon you want to switch to.
