# Overview of the dart_meteor Package

The `dart_meteor` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to integrate with Meteor, a full-stack JavaScript platform for building web and mobile applications. This package allows Flutter apps to communicate seamlessly with Meteor servers, enabling real-time data synchronization and efficient data handling.

## When to Use dart_meteor

You should consider using `dart_meteor` when:
- You are developing a Flutter application that requires real-time data updates.
- You want to leverage Meteor's capabilities for building reactive applications.
- You need a robust solution for managing data between your Flutter app and a Meteor backend.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Data Synchronization**: Automatically updates the UI when data changes on the server.
- **Reactive Programming**: Utilizes Meteor's reactive data sources to keep your app in sync with the backend.
- **Easy Integration**: Simplifies the process of connecting Flutter apps to Meteor servers.
- **Support for Meteor's DDP Protocol**: Allows for efficient communication between the client and server.

# Setting Up dart_meteor in Your Flutter Project

## Installation

To get started with the `dart_meteor` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dart_meteor: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/dart_meteor).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions if your app requires network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage

To use the `dart_meteor` package, you need to create an instance of the `Meteor` class and connect it to your Meteor server. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:dart_meteor/dart_meteor.dart';

void main() {
  // Create a new instance of the Meteor class
  final meteor = Meteor('ws://your_meteor_server_url/websocket');

  // Connect to the Meteor server
  meteor.connect();

  // Listen for data changes
  meteor.on('data', (data) {
    print('Data received: $data');
  });
}
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to connect to a Meteor server and listen for incoming data. Replace `your_meteor_server_url` with the actual URL of your Meteor server.

# Complete Example of Using dart_meteor

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dart_meteor/dart_meteor.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Create a new instance of the Meteor class
  final Meteor meteor = Meteor('ws://your_meteor_server_url/websocket');
  String data = 'No data received yet';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Connect to the Meteor server
    meteor.connect();

    // Listen for data changes
    meteor.on('data', (newData) {
      // Update the state with new data
      setState(() {
        data = newData;
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Disconnect from the Meteor server when the widget is disposed
    meteor.disconnect();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('RealFlutter with dart_meteor'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(data), // Display the received data
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the initState method, we create a Meteor instance and connect to the server.
// 3. We set up a listener for incoming data from the server.
// 4. When data is received, we update the state, which triggers a rebuild of the UI.
// 5. The received data is displayed in the center of the screen.
// 6. When the widget is disposed, we ensure to disconnect from the Meteor server to prevent memory leaks.
