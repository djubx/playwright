# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Widget Slider

## Step 1: Adding Dependency

To get started with the `widget_slider` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  widget_slider: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 4: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `widget_slider` in your app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:widget_slider/widget_slider.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Widget Slider Example')),
        body: WidgetSlider(
          children: [
            Container(color: Colors.red, child: Center(child: Text('Slide 1'))),
            Container(color: Colors.green, child: Center(child: Text('Slide 2'))),
            Container(color: Colors.blue, child: Center(child: Text('Slide 3'))),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple slider with three colored slides. Each slide contains a centered text widget.

# Complete Example of Widget Slider

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:widget_slider/widget_slider.dart';

// Main class of the application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Widget Slider Example')),
        body: WidgetSlider(
          // List of widgets to be displayed in the slider
          children: [
            // First slide with red background
            Container(
              color: Colors.red,
              child: Center(child: Text('Slide 1', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.white))),
            ),
            // Second slide with green background
            Container(
              color: Colors.green,
              child: Center(child: Text('Slide 2', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.white))),
            ),
            // Third slide with blue background
            Container(
              color: Colors.blue,
              child: Center(child: Text('Slide 3', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.white))),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a WidgetSlider.
3. The WidgetSlider widget takes a list of children, which are the slides to be displayed.
4. Each slide is a Container with a different background color and centered text.
5. Users can swipe left or right to navigate through the slides, providing an interactive experience.
*/
```
<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this complete example, we have created a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the `widget_slider` package. The application consists of three slides, each with a different background color and text. The comments within the code explain the flow of the application step-by-step, making it easy to understand how the `widget_slider` works. 

### Summary of Code Flow
- The application initializes with the `main()` function, which sets up the `RealFlutter` widget.
- The `RealFlutter` widget constructs a `MaterialApp` with a `Scaffold` that includes an `AppBar` and a `WidgetSlider`.
- The `WidgetSlider` contains three slides, each represented by a `Container` with a unique color and centered text.
- Users can swipe through the slides, showcasing the interactive capabilities of the `widget_slider` package.
