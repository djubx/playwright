# Setting Up and Using the Codicon Package

## Installation
To get started with the Codicon package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  codicon: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Usage
To use Codicon in your Flutter application, you can import the package and start using the icons as follows:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:codicon/codicon.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Codicon Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Icon(
                Codicon.home, // Using Codicon's home icon
                size: 50,
                color: Colors.blue,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              Icon(
                Codicon.settings, // Using Codicon's settings icon
                size: 50,
                color: Colors.green,
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code demonstrates how to integrate Codicon icons into a simple Flutter application. You can customize the size and color of the icons as needed.

# Complete Example of Using Codicon

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:codicon/codicon.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Codicon Example'), // Title of the app
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center, // Centering the column
            children: <Widget>[
              Icon(
                Codicon.home, // Displaying the home icon
                size: 50, // Setting the size of the icon
                color: Colors.blue, // Setting the color of the icon
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              Icon(
                Codicon.settings, // Displaying the settings icon
                size: 50, // Setting the size of the icon
                color: Colors.green, // Setting the color of the icon
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the RealFlutter app
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The main function is the entry point of the application, which calls runApp() to start the app.
2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the main structure of the app.
3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp widget is created, which provides the app's basic structure.
4. A Scaffold widget is used to create the app's visual layout, including an AppBar and a body.
5. The AppBar contains the title of the app.
6. The body of the Scaffold is centered using a Center widget, which contains a Column widget.
7. The Column widget arranges its children vertically, with the main axis aligned to the center.
8. Two Codicon icons (home and settings) are displayed with specified sizes and colors, separated by a SizedBox for spacing.
9. The app is simple yet demonstrates how to effectively use Codicon icons in a Flutter application.
