# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `flutter_sticky_header`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_sticky_header` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_sticky_header: ^0.6.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to set the platform version in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement sticky headers.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_sticky_header/flutter_sticky_header.dart';
```

2. Create a StatefulWidget to manage the state of your list.

3. Use the `StickyHeader` widget to wrap your header and content.

Hereâ€™s a basic implementation:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Sticky Header Example')),
      body: CustomScrollView(
        slivers: <Widget>[
          SliverStickyHeader(
            header: Container(
              height: 50.0,
              color: Colors.blue,
              alignment: Alignment.center,
              child: Text('Header 1', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white)),
            ),
            sliver: SliverList(
              delegate: SliverChildBuilderDelegate(
                (BuildContext context, int index) => ListTile(
                  title: Text('Item #$index'),
                ),
                childCount: 10,
              ),
            ),
          ),
          // Add more headers and lists as needed
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Running the Application

You can now run your application on an emulator or a physical device. The sticky headers should work seamlessly as you scroll through the list.

In summary, the `flutter_sticky_header` package is easy to set up and provides a great way to enhance the user experience in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of `flutter_sticky_header`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_sticky_header/flutter_sticky_header.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sticky Header Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Sticky Header Example')),
      body: CustomScrollView(
        slivers: <Widget>[
          // First sticky header
          SliverStickyHeader(
            header: Container(
              height: 50.0,
              color: Colors.blue,
              alignment: Alignment.center,
              child: Text('Header 1', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white)),
            ),
            sliver: SliverList(
              delegate: SliverChildBuilderDelegate(
                (BuildContext context, int index) => ListTile(
                  title: Text('Item #$index'),
                ),
                childCount: 10, // Number of items under Header 1
              ),
            ),
          ),
          // Second sticky header
          SliverStickyHeader(
            header: Container(
              height: 50.0,
              color: Colors.green,
              alignment: Alignment.center,
              child: Text('Header 2', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white)),
            ),
            sliver: SliverList(
              delegate: SliverChildBuilderDelegate(
                (BuildContext context, int index) => ListTile(
                  title: Text('Item #${index + 10}'), // Items under Header 2
                ),
                childCount: 10, // Number of items under Header 2
              ),
            ),
          ),
          // Additional headers can be added similarly
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets MyApp as the home widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home screen.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that creates a CustomScrollView with sticky headers.
// 4. Each SliverStickyHeader contains a header and a list of items.
// 5. As the user scrolls, the headers remain at the top of the screen, providing context to the items below.
```
