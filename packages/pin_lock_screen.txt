# Description

The `pin_lock_screen` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to implement a secure PIN-based lock screen in your Flutter applications. This package is particularly useful for applications that require an additional layer of security, such as banking apps, personal finance apps, or any application that handles sensitive user data.

## Features
- **Customizable UI**: The package allows developers to customize the appearance of the lock screen, including colors, button styles, and animations.

- **Biometric Support**: The package can be integrated with biometric authentication methods, such as fingerprint or facial recognition, to enhance security.
- **Easy Integration**: With straightforward setup and usage, developers can quickly implement the lock screen functionality in their applications.

## When to Use
You should consider using the `pin_lock_screen` package in scenarios such as:
- When your application requires user authentication to access sensitive features.
- If you want to provide users with a secure way to lock and unlock their app.
- When you need to comply with security regulations that require user authentication.

Overall, the `pin_lock_screen` package is an excellent choice for developers looking to enhance the security of their Flutter applications with a user-friendly PIN entry system.

# Tutorial

## Setup Process

To get started with the `pin_lock_screen` package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add Dependency
Add the `pin_lock_screen` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  pin_lock_screen: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

### Step 2: Install Packages
Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

2. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` if you plan to use biometric authentication:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.USE_BIOMETRIC"/>
```

#### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request permission for biometric authentication:

```xml
<key>NSFaceIDUsageDescription</key>
<string>We use Face ID to enhance your security.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library.</string>
```

### Step 4: Import the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:pin_lock_screen/pin_lock_screen.dart';
```

## Using the Package

To use the `pin_lock_screen` package, you can create a simple lock screen by following these steps:

1. Create a new StatefulWidget that will serve as your lock screen.
2. Use the `PinLockScreen` widget provided by the package.
3. Handle the PIN input and authentication logic.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the lock screen in your app.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pin_lock_screen/pin_lock_screen.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Pin Lock Screen Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: LockScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class LockScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _LockScreenState createState() => _LockScreenState();
}

class _LockScreenState extends State<LockScreen> {
  // This variable will hold the correct PIN
  final String correctPin = "1234"; // Example PIN
  String enteredPin = ""; // Variable to store the entered PIN

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Enter PIN'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: PinLockScreen(
          // Callback when the PIN is entered
          onSubmit: (String pin) {
            setState(() {
              enteredPin = pin; // Update the entered PIN
            });
            // Check if the entered PIN is correct
            if (enteredPin == correctPin) {
              // Navigate to the next screen if the PIN is correct
              Navigator.push(
                context,
                MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => HomeScreen()),
              );
            } else {
              // Show an error message if the PIN is incorrect
              ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                SnackBar(content: Text('Incorrect PIN!')),
              );
            }
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to the Home Screen!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home screen as LockScreen.
// 3. The LockScreen widget displays a PinLockScreen where users can enter their PIN.
// 4. When the user submits the PIN, the onSubmit callback is triggered.
// 5. The entered PIN is compared with the correct PIN (in this case, "1234").
// 6. If the PIN is correct, the user is navigated to the HomeScreen.
// 7. If the PIN is incorrect, a SnackBar message is displayed to inform the user.
