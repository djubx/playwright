# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Location Picker Flutter Map

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `location_picker_flutter_map` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `location_picker_flutter_map` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  location_picker_flutter_map: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/location_picker_flutter_map).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request location permissions:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show nearby places.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to provide better services.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to implement the location picker.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:location_picker_flutter_map/location_picker_flutter_map.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Location Picker Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: LocationPickerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class LocationPickerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _LocationPickerScreenState createState() => _LocationPickerScreenState();
}

class _LocationPickerScreenState extends State<LocationPickerScreen> {
  // Variable to hold the selected location
  LatLng? _selectedLocation;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Pick a Location'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Display the selected location if available
          if (_selectedLocation != null)
            Padding(
              padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
              child: Text(
                'Selected Location: ${_selectedLocation!.latitude}, ${_selectedLocation!.longitude}',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
              ),
            ),
          Expanded(
            child: LocationPickerMap(
              // Initial location to display on the map
              initialLocation: LatLng(37.7749, -122.4194), // San Francisco
              onLocationPicked: (location) {
                // Update the selected location when the user picks a location
                setState(() {
                  _selectedLocation = location;
                });
              },
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home screen is set to LocationPickerScreen, which manages the state of the selected location.
// 4. In the LocationPickerScreen, we define a variable _selectedLocation to hold the user's selected location.
// 5. The UI consists of an AppBar and a Column that displays the selected location and the map.
// 6. The LocationPickerMap widget is initialized with a default location (San Francisco).
// 7. When the user picks a location on the map, the onLocationPicked callback is triggered, updating the _selectedLocation state.
// 8. The selected location is displayed above the map, providing immediate feedback to the user.
```
