# Tutorial

## Setup Process

To get started with the `pin_plus_keyboard` package, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the package dependency:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     pin_plus_keyboard: ^latest_version
   ```

   Replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/pin_plus_keyboard).

2. **Install the Package**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions if you are using features that require them (e.g., internet access).
   - **iOS**: For iOS, ensure that your app's deployment target is set to at least iOS 10.0 in the `ios/Podfile`.

4. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the package:

   ```dart
   import 'package:pin_plus_keyboard/pin_plus_keyboard.dart';
   ```

## Using the Package

To use the `pin_plus_keyboard`, you can create a simple PIN input screen. Here’s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pin_plus_keyboard/pin_plus_keyboard.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('PIN Input Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: PinPlusKeyboard(
            onSubmit: (String pin) {
              // Handle the submitted PIN
              print('Entered PIN: $pin');
            },
            onError: (String error) {
              // Handle any errors
              print('Error: $error');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example:
- The `PinPlusKeyboard` widget is used to create a PIN input field.
- The `onSubmit` callback is triggered when the user submits their PIN.
- The `onError` callback handles any input errors.

This setup provides a basic implementation of the `pin_plus_keyboard` package, allowing you to customize it further based on your application's requirements.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pin_plus_keyboard/pin_plus_keyboard.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('PIN Input Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: PinPlusKeyboard(
            // Callback when the user submits the PIN
            onSubmit: (String pin) {
              // Print the entered PIN to the console
              print('Entered PIN: $pin');
              // Here you can add logic to verify the PIN
            },
            // Callback for handling errors
            onError: (String error) {
              // Print the error message to the console
              print('Error: $error');
              // You can show a dialog or a snackbar to inform the user
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The main function is the entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a simple UI containing an AppBar and a centered PinPlusKeyboard widget.
// 3. When the user enters a PIN and submits it, the onSubmit callback is triggered, printing the entered PIN to the console.
// 4. If there is an error during input, the onError callback is triggered, allowing you to handle the error appropriately (e.g., showing a message to the user).
// 5. This structure allows for easy customization and integration of the PIN input functionality into any Flutter application.
