# Tutorial: Setting Up the Apple Sign In Safety Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `apple_sign_in_safety` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency
First, add the `apple_sign_in_safety` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  apple_sign_in_safety: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: iOS Configuration
For iOS, you need to perform the following steps:

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following keys to enable Apple Sign In:

```xml
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
  <dict>
    <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
    <array>
      <string>your.bundle.id</string>
    </array>
  </dict>
</array>
<key>NSAppleMusicUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your Apple Music account.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library.</string>
```

2. Ensure that your app's capabilities include "Sign In with Apple".

## Step 3: Android Configuration
For Android, you need to ensure that your app is set up to handle the authentication flow. Add the following to your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-auth:19.0.0'
}
```

## Step 4: Using the Package
Now that you have configured your project, you can start using the `apple_sign_in_safety` package in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement Apple Sign In:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:apple_sign_in_safety/apple_sign_in_safety.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Apple Sign In Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Trigger the Apple Sign In process
              final result = await AppleSignInSafety.signIn();
              if (result != null) {
                // Handle successful sign in
                print('User signed in: ${result.user}');
              } else {
                // Handle sign in failure
                print('Sign in failed');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Sign in with Apple'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app with a button that triggers the Apple Sign In process. The result is then handled based on whether the sign-in was successful or not.

# Complete Example of Apple Sign In Safety

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:apple_sign_in_safety/apple_sign_in_safety.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Apple Sign In Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Trigger the Apple Sign In process
              final result = await AppleSignInSafety.signIn();
              if (result != null) {
                // Handle successful sign in
                print('User signed in: ${result.user}');
              } else {
                // Handle sign in failure
                print('Sign in failed');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Sign in with Apple'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts by running the main function, which initializes the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a simple UI.
// 3. The UI contains an AppBar and a Center widget with an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, it calls the AppleSignInSafety.signIn() method.
// 5. If the sign-in is successful, it prints the user's information to the console.
// 6. If the sign-in fails, it prints an error message to the console.
