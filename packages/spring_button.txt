# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Spring Button Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **spring_button** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  spring_button: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the spring button, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:spring_button/spring_button.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Spring Button

You can now use the `SpringButton` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to implement it:

```dart
SpringButton(
  SpringButtonType.OnlyScale,
  Text('Press Me'),
  onTap: () {
    // Action to perform on button press
    print('Button Pressed!');
  },
  // Customize the spring properties
  SpringConfig(
    stiffness: 100,
    damping: 10,
  ),
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details

- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid compatibility issues.
  
```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

- **iOS**: No specific configurations are required, but ensure that your iOS deployment target is compatible with the Flutter version you are using.

## Step 4: Customization

You can customize the button further by changing its appearance, such as color, size, and text style. The `SpringButton` widget allows you to pass additional parameters for customization.

```dart
SpringButton(
  SpringButtonType.OnlyScale,
  Text(
    'Custom Button',
    style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
  ),
  onTap: () {
    // Action to perform on button press
    print('Custom Button Pressed!');
  },
  backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
  // Customize the spring properties
  SpringConfig(
    stiffness: 150,
    damping: 15,
  ),
)
```

With these steps, you can easily set up and use the **spring_button** package in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Using the Spring Button Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:spring_button/spring_button.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Spring Button Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Spring Button Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: SpringButton(
            SpringButtonType.OnlyScale,
            Text(
              'Press Me',
              style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
            ),
            onTap: () {
              // Action to perform on button press
              print('Button Pressed!');
            },
            backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
            // Customize the spring properties
            SpringConfig(
              stiffness: 100,
              damping: 10,
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Spring Button Demo'.
// 4. In the body of the Scaffold, a SpringButton is created and centered on the screen.
// 5. The SpringButton has a text label 'Press Me' and a blue background color.
// 6. When the button is pressed, it triggers the onTap callback, which prints 'Button Pressed!' to the console.
// 7. The spring animation is configured with specific stiffness and damping values to control the animation effect.
```
