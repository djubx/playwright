```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage

Once you have installed the package, you can start using its features. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use an extension method provided by `nyxx_extensions`:

```dart
import 'package:nyxx_extensions/nyxx_extensions.dart';

void main() {
  String text = "Hello, Flutter!";
  print(text.toUpperCase()); // Using an extension method to convert text to uppercase
}
```

This example demonstrates how to use the `toUpperCase` extension method to convert a string to uppercase. The package provides various other extension methods that can be utilized similarly.

# Complete Example of Using nyxx_extensions

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:nyxx_extensions/nyxx_extensions.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Nyxx Extensions Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Nyxx Extensions Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(
            'Hello, Flutter!'.toUpperCase(), // Using the extension method to convert text to uppercase
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application, which calls runApp().
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the main UI.
// 3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp widget is created with a title and a home property.
// 4. The home property is a Scaffold widget that provides a basic material design visual layout structure.
// 5. The AppBar widget displays the title of the application.
// 6. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 7. The child of the Center widget is a Text widget that displays "Hello, Flutter!" in uppercase using the toUpperCase extension method.
// 8. The Text widget's style is set to have a font size of 24 for better visibility.
