# Tutorial: Setting Up the Moon Phase Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, you need to add the **moon_phase** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  moon_phase: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install the Package
Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Import the Package
In your Dart files, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:moon_phase/moon_phase.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package
You can now use the package to get the moon phase for a specific date. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
void main() {
  final date = DateTime.now();
  final phase = MoonPhase.fromDate(date);
  print('Current Moon Phase: ${phase.phaseName}');
}
```

This code snippet retrieves the current moon phase and prints its name.

With these steps, you are now ready to use the **moon_phase** package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Moon Phase Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:moon_phase/moon_phase.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Moon Phase App',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MoonPhaseScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class MoonPhaseScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MoonPhaseScreenState createState() => _MoonPhaseScreenState();
}

class _MoonPhaseScreenState extends State<MoonPhaseScreen> {
  String _moonPhase = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _getMoonPhase(); // Call the method to get the moon phase on initialization
  }

  // Method to get the current moon phase
  void _getMoonPhase() {
    final date = DateTime.now(); // Get the current date
    final phase = MoonPhase.fromDate(date); // Calculate the moon phase
    setState(() {
      _moonPhase = phase.phaseName; // Update the state with the moon phase name
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Current Moon Phase'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Current Moon Phase: $_moonPhase', // Display the moon phase
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: _getMoonPhase, // Refresh the moon phase on button press
        tooltip: 'Refresh',
        child: Icon(Icons.refresh),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home screen is set to MoonPhaseScreen, which is a stateful widget.
// 4. In the _MoonPhaseScreenState, the _getMoonPhase method is called in initState to fetch the current moon phase.
// 5. The moon phase is calculated using the MoonPhase.fromDate method and stored in the _moonPhase variable.
// 6. The build method displays the current moon phase in the center of the screen.
// 7. A FloatingActionButton is provided to refresh the moon phase when pressed, calling the _getMoonPhase method again.
```
