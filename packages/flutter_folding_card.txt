# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_folding_card

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_folding_card` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_folding_card` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_folding_card: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that the package is set up, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `flutter_folding_card` in your app.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_folding_card/flutter_folding_card.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Folding Card Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Folding Card Example'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: ListView(
            children: [
              // Creating a folding card
              FoldingCard(
                // The header of the card
                header: Container(
                  color: Colors.blue,
                  padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
                  child: Text(
                    'What is Flutter?',
                    style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 18),
                  ),
                ),
                // The content of the card that expands
                content: Container(
                  padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
                  child: Text(
                    'Flutter is an open-source UI software development toolkit created by Google. '
                    'It is used to develop applications for Android, iOS, Linux, Mac, Windows, '
                    'Google Fuchsia, and the web from a single codebase.',
                  ),
                ),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 16), // Space between cards
              FoldingCard(
                header: Container(
                  color: Colors.green,
                  padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
                  child: Text(
                    'Why Use Flutter?',
                    style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 18),
                  ),
                ),
                content: Container(
                  padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
                  child: Text(
                    'Flutter allows for fast development, expressive UI, and native performance. '
                    'It provides a rich set of pre-designed widgets and tools to create beautiful applications.',
                  ),
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The above code creates a simple Flutter application with two folding cards.
// The main function initializes the app and sets the home widget to RealFlutter.
// The RealFlutter class builds the UI, which includes an AppBar and a ListView containing FoldingCards.
// Each FoldingCard has a header and content. The header is displayed when the card is collapsed, 
// and the content is revealed when the card is expanded. 
// The cards are styled with padding and colors to enhance the visual appeal.
```
<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the `flutter_folding_card` package. The application consists of two folding cards, each with a header and expandable content. The comments within the code explain the flow of the application step-by-step, making it easy to understand how to implement and use the package effectively.

### Summary of Application Flow

1. **Initialization**: The `main` function initializes the Flutter application and sets the home widget to `RealFlutter`.
2. **UI Structure**: The `RealFlutter` class builds the UI, which includes an `AppBar` and a `ListView` containing multiple `FoldingCard` widgets.
3. **Folding Cards**: Each `FoldingCard` has a header that is always visible and content that expands when the card is tapped. This allows users to interactively view information without overwhelming the interface.
4. **Styling**: The cards are styled with padding and colors to enhance the user experience, making the application visually appealing.

This structured approach provides a comprehensive understanding of the `flutter_folding_card` package, from its description and setup to a complete example of its implementation.
