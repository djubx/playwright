# Tutorial: Setting Up the Paytm All-in-One SDK in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `paytm_allinonesdk` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `paytm_allinonesdk` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  paytm_allinonesdk: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions and activity:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>

<application>
    ...
    <activity android:name="com.paytm.pgsdk.PaytmPaymentActivity" />
</application>
```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the correct configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. **CocoaPods**: Ensure you have the latest version of CocoaPods installed. Run `pod install` in the `ios` directory.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your Flutter application.

### Example Code

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:paytm_allinonesdk/paytm_allinonesdk.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Paytm All-in-One SDK Demo',
      home: PaymentScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PaymentScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  // Function to initiate payment
  void startPayment() async {
    // Create a payment request
    var response = await PaytmAllInOneSdk.startPayment(
      orderId: "ORDER123",
      customerId: "CUSTOMER123",
      amount: "1.00",
      merchantId: "YOUR_MERCHANT_ID",
      callbackUrl: "YOUR_CALLBACK_URL",
      isStaging: true, // Set to false for production
    );

    // Handle the response
    print("Payment Response: $response");
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Paytm Payment'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: startPayment,
          child: Text('Pay Now'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example: Paytm All-in-One SDK in Flutter

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:paytm_allinonesdk/paytm_allinonesdk.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Paytm All-in-One SDK Demo',
      home: PaymentScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PaymentScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  // Function to initiate payment
  void startPayment() async {
    // Create a payment request
    var response = await PaytmAllInOneSdk.startPayment(
      orderId: "ORDER123", // Unique order ID
      customerId: "CUSTOMER123", // Unique customer ID
      amount: "1.00", // Amount to be paid
      merchantId: "YOUR_MERCHANT_ID", // Your Paytm merchant ID
      callbackUrl: "YOUR_CALLBACK_URL", // Callback URL for payment status
      isStaging: true, // Set to false for production
    );

    // Handle the response
    print("Payment Response: $response");
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Paytm Payment'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: startPayment, // Trigger payment on button press
          child: Text('Pay Now'), // Button text
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The home screen is set to PaymentScreen, where the payment process is initiated.
// 3. When the "Pay Now" button is pressed, the startPayment function is called.
// 4. The startPayment function creates a payment request with necessary details like order ID, customer ID, amount, merchant ID, and callback URL.
// 5. The payment response is printed to the console for debugging purposes.
// 6. The user can see the payment process in action, and the app handles the response accordingly.
