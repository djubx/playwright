# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Vertical Scrollable TabView

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `vertical_scrollable_tabview` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `vertical_scrollable_tabview` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  vertical_scrollable_tabview: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple application that demonstrates how to use the `vertical_scrollable_tabview`.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:vertical_scrollable_tabview/vertical_scrollable_tabview.dart';
```

2. Create a new widget that uses `VerticalScrollableTabView`:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Vertical Scrollable TabView Example')),
        body: VerticalScrollableTabView(
          tabs: [
            Tab(text: 'Tab 1'),
            Tab(text: 'Tab 2'),
            Tab(text: 'Tab 3'),
          ],
          views: [
            Center(child: Text('Content for Tab 1')),
            Center(child: Text('Content for Tab 2')),
            Center(child: Text('Content for Tab 3')),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Run your application using `flutter run`.

This setup will create a simple vertical tab view with three tabs, each displaying different content.

# Complete Example of Vertical Scrollable TabView

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:vertical_scrollable_tabview/vertical_scrollable_tabview.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Vertical Scrollable TabView Example')),
        body: VerticalScrollableTabView(
          // Define the tabs for the vertical tab view
          tabs: [
            Tab(text: 'Tab 1'), // First tab
            Tab(text: 'Tab 2'), // Second tab
            Tab(text: 'Tab 3'), // Third tab
          ],
          // Define the views corresponding to each tab
          views: [
            Center(child: Text('Content for Tab 1')), // Content for first tab
            Center(child: Text('Content for Tab 2')), // Content for second tab
            Center(child: Text('Content for Tab 3')), // Content for third tab
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The AppBar displays the title of the application.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains the VerticalScrollableTabView widget.
// 5. The VerticalScrollableTabView takes a list of tabs and corresponding views.
// 6. When a tab is selected, the corresponding view is displayed in the center of the screen.
// 7. Each tab can be scrolled vertically, allowing for easy navigation between different sections of the app.
```
