# Setting Up and Using webview_flutter_x5

## Installation
To add the `webview_flutter_x5` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  webview_flutter_x5: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/webview_flutter_x5).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

2. **Enable JavaScript**: Ensure that JavaScript is enabled in your WebView settings.

### iOS
1. **Update Info.plist**: Add the following key to your `Info.plist` file to allow arbitrary loads:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. **Enable JavaScript**: Similar to Android, ensure that JavaScript is enabled in your WebView settings.

## Basic Usage
To use the `webview_flutter_x5` package, you can create a simple WebView widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:webview_flutter_x5/webview_flutter_x5.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('WebView Example'),
      ),
      body: WebView(
        initialUrl: 'https://flutter.dev',
        javascriptMode: JavascriptMode.unrestricted, // Enable JavaScript
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code creates a simple app with a WebView that loads the Flutter website.

# Complete Example of webview_flutter_x5

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:webview_flutter_x5/webview_flutter_x5.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'WebView Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('WebView Example'),
        ),
        body: WebView(
          initialUrl: 'https://flutter.dev', // The URL to load
          javascriptMode: JavascriptMode.unrestricted, // Allow JavaScript execution
          onWebViewCreated: (WebViewController webViewController) {
            // This callback is called when the WebView is created
            print("WebView created");
          },
          onPageFinished: (String url) {
            // This callback is called when the page finishes loading
            print("Page finished loading: $url");
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body contains a WebView that loads the Flutter website.
// 5. JavaScript is enabled for the WebView to allow dynamic content.
// 6. Callbacks are provided to handle events like WebView creation and page loading completion.
