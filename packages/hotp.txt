// The app starts by running the main function, which creates a new instance of the MyApp class.
// The MyApp class is a stateless widget that returns a MaterialApp with a title and a theme.
// The home property of the MaterialApp is set to an instance of the MyHomePage class.
// The MyHomePage class is a stateful widget that generates a one-time password when the user clicks the Generate OTP button.
// The _generateOTP function creates a new instance of the HOTP class and generates a one-time password using the at method.
// The one-time password is then updated in the UI using the setState method.
// The app displays the one-time password in the center of the screen, along with a button to generate a new OTP.
