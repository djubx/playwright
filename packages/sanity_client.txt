# Sanity Client Flutter Package

The `sanity_client` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to facilitate seamless integration with Sanity.io, a headless CMS that allows developers to manage content in a structured way. This package provides a straightforward API to interact with Sanity's content and data, making it an excellent choice for Flutter developers looking to build dynamic applications that require real-time content updates.

## When to Use This Package
- **Content-Driven Applications**: Ideal for apps that rely heavily on content management, such as blogs, portfolios, or e-commerce platforms.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Perfect for applications that need to reflect content changes in real-time without requiring a full app refresh.
- **Customizable Content Structures**: Useful for projects that require a flexible content model, allowing developers to define their own schemas.

## Features
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup process to connect your Flutter app with Sanity.io.
- **Real-Time Data Fetching**: Leverages Sanity's real-time capabilities to fetch and update content dynamically.
- **Querying with GROQ**: Supports Sanity's query language, GROQ, for fetching data efficiently.
- **Offline Support**: Allows for caching of data, enabling offline access to previously fetched content.
- **Customizable Client**: Provides options to customize the client configuration to suit specific project needs.

Overall, the `sanity_client` package is a robust solution for developers looking to integrate Sanity.io into their Flutter applications, providing a rich set of features to manage and display content effectively.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Sanity Client Package

## Installation
To get started with the `sanity_client` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  sanity_client: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/sanity_client).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21.
2. Add internet permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following to allow network requests:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `sanity_client`, you need to initialize the client with your Sanity project ID and dataset. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sanity_client/sanity_client.dart';

class RealFlutter {
  final SanityClient client;

  RealFlutter()
      : client = SanityClient(
          projectId: 'your_project_id',
          dataset: 'your_dataset',
          useCdn: true, // Use CDN for faster response
        );

  // Method to fetch data
  Future<List<dynamic>> fetchData(String query) async {
    final response = await client.fetch(query);
    return response;
  }
}
```

In this example, replace `'your_project_id'` and `'your_dataset'` with your actual Sanity project credentials.

Now you can use the `fetchData` method to retrieve content from your Sanity dataset using GROQ queries.

# Complete Example of Using the Sanity Client

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sanity_client/sanity_client.dart';

class RealFlutter {
  final SanityClient client;

  RealFlutter()
      : client = SanityClient(
          projectId: 'your_project_id', // Replace with your project ID
          dataset: 'your_dataset', // Replace with your dataset
          useCdn: true, // Use CDN for faster response
        );

  // Method to fetch data using a GROQ query
  Future<List<dynamic>> fetchData(String query) async {
    final response = await client.fetch(query);
    return response;
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sanity Client Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  final RealFlutter realFlutter = RealFlutter(); // Initialize the RealFlutter class
  List<dynamic> posts = []; // List to hold fetched posts

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    fetchPosts(); // Fetch posts when the widget is initialized
  }

  // Method to fetch posts from Sanity
  Future<void> fetchPosts() async {
    String query = '*[_type == "post"]'; // GROQ query to fetch posts
    List<dynamic> fetchedPosts = await realFlutter.fetchData(query); // Fetch data
    setState(() {
      posts = fetchedPosts; // Update the state with fetched posts
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Sanity Client Example'),
      ),
      body: posts.isEmpty // Check if posts are empty
          ? Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator()) // Show loading indicator
          : ListView.builder(
              itemCount: posts.length, // Number of posts
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text(posts[index]['title']), // Display post title
                  subtitle: Text(posts[index]['description']), // Display post description
                );
              },
            ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a HomeScreen as its home.
// 3. HomeScreen initializes the RealFlutter class to create a Sanity client.
// 4. In the initState method, fetchPosts is called to retrieve posts from Sanity.
// 5. fetchPosts uses a GROQ query to fetch all posts of type "post".
// 6. The fetched posts are stored in the posts list and the state is updated.
// 7. The build method checks if posts are empty; if so, it shows a loading indicator.
// 8. Once posts are fetched, a ListView displays the titles and descriptions of the posts.
