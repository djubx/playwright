# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_date_pickers

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_date_pickers` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_date_pickers` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_date_pickers: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` file to support localization if you plan to use it. Add the following lines to your `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>CFBundleLocalizations</key>
<array>
    <string>en</string>
    <string>es</string> <!-- Add other languages as needed -->
</array>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a date picker.

# Complete Example: Implementing flutter_date_pickers

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_date_pickers/flutter_date_pickers.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Date Pickers Example',
      home: DatePickerExample(),
    );
  }
}

class DatePickerExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DatePickerExampleState createState() => _DatePickerExampleState();
}

class _DatePickerExampleState extends State<DatePickerExample> {
  // Define the selected date variable
  DateTime? _selectedDate;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Date Picker Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the selected date
            Text(
              _selectedDate == null
                  ? 'No date selected!'
                  : 'Selected date: ${_selectedDate!.toLocal()}'.split(' ')[0],
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to open the date picker
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () => _selectDate(context),
              child: Text('Select Date'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to show the date picker
  Future<void> _selectDate(BuildContext context) async {
    // Show the date picker dialog
    final DateTime? picked = await showDialog<DateTime>(
      context: context,
      builder: (BuildContext context) {
        return SimpleDialog(
          title: Text('Select a date'),
          children: <Widget>[
            DatePickerDialog(
              initialDate: DateTime.now(),
              firstDate: DateTime(2000),
              lastDate: DateTime(2101),
              onDateChanged: (DateTime date) {
                // Update the selected date
                setState(() {
                  _selectedDate = date;
                });
                Navigator.of(context).pop(date); // Close the dialog
              },
            ),
          ],
        );
      },
    );

    // Update the state with the selected date
    if (picked != null && picked != _selectedDate) {
      setState(() {
        _selectedDate = picked;
      });
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget (DatePickerExample).
// 3. DatePickerExample is a stateful widget that maintains the selected date.
// 4. The build method displays the selected date or a message if no date is selected.
// 5. When the "Select Date" button is pressed, the _selectDate method is called.
// 6. _selectDate shows a SimpleDialog with a DatePickerDialog.
// 7. When a date is selected, it updates the _selectedDate variable and closes the dialog.
// 8. The UI is updated to reflect the newly selected date.
```
