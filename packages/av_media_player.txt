# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using av_media_player

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `av_media_player` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `av_media_player` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  av_media_player: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/av_media_player).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio playback.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library for media selection.</string>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple media player.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:av_media_player/av_media_player.dart';
```

2. Create a new class `RealFlutter` that extends `StatefulWidget`:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late AVMediaPlayer _mediaPlayer;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _mediaPlayer = AVMediaPlayer();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _mediaPlayer.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  // Add methods for play, pause, and stop here
}
```

3. Implement the playback controls and UI in the `build` method.

This setup provides a basic structure for using the `av_media_player` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of av_media_player

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:av_media_player/av_media_player.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late AVMediaPlayer _mediaPlayer; // Declare the media player
  bool _isPlaying = false; // Track playback state

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _mediaPlayer = AVMediaPlayer(); // Initialize the media player
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _mediaPlayer.dispose(); // Dispose of the media player
    super.dispose();
  }

  // Method to play media
  void _playMedia() {
    _mediaPlayer.play('https://www.example.com/audio.mp3'); // Replace with your media URL
    setState(() {
      _isPlaying = true; // Update playback state
    });
  }

  // Method to pause media
  void _pauseMedia() {
    _mediaPlayer.pause(); // Pause the media
    setState(() {
      _isPlaying = false; // Update playback state
    });
  }

  // Method to stop media
  void _stopMedia() {
    _mediaPlayer.stop(); // Stop the media
    setState(() {
      _isPlaying = false; // Update playback state
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('AV Media Player Example'), // App title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              _isPlaying ? 'Playing...' : 'Stopped', // Display playback state
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _isPlaying ? _pauseMedia : _playMedia, // Toggle play/pause
              child: Text(_isPlaying ? 'Pause' : 'Play'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _stopMedia, // Stop media
              child: Text('Stop'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The AVMediaPlayer is initialized in initState.
// 3. The UI displays the current playback state (Playing or Stopped).
// 4. The Play/Pause button toggles between playing and pausing the media.
// 5. The Stop button stops the media playback.
// 6. The media player is disposed of when the widget is removed from the widget tree.
```
<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple media player application using the `av_media_player` package. The application allows users to play, pause, and stop audio playback. The flow of the application is straightforward, with clear state management and user interaction through buttons. 

### Summary of Application Flow
- The application initializes the media player and sets up the UI.
- Users can play or pause the media using a single button, which changes its label based on the current state.
- A separate button allows users to stop the playback.
- The media player is properly disposed of to free up resources when the widget is no longer in use.

This structure provides a solid foundation for building more complex media applications using the `av_media_player` package in Flutter.
