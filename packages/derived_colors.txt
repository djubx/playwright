# Derived Colors Flutter Package

The `derived_colors` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to simplify the process of creating color palettes based on existing colors. This package allows developers to generate a variety of derived colors, such as shades, tints, and tones, which can be particularly useful for creating consistent and visually appealing UI designs.

## When to Use

You might consider using the `derived_colors` package in scenarios such as:
- **Theming**: When you want to create a cohesive color theme for your application.
- **Dynamic UI**: If your app requires dynamic color changes based on user preferences or themes.
- **Accessibility**: To ensure that your color choices meet accessibility standards by providing sufficient contrast.

## Features

- **Color Manipulation**: Easily create lighter or darker versions of a color.
- **Custom Color Palettes**: Generate a set of colors based on a primary color.
- **Ease of Use**: Simple API that integrates seamlessly with Flutter's existing color system.

With these features, `derived_colors` empowers developers to enhance their applications' visual aesthetics while maintaining a clean and manageable codebase.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Derived Colors

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `derived_colors` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  derived_colors: ^1.0.0
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create derived colors from a base color.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:derived_colors/derived_colors.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Define a base color
    Color baseColor = Colors.blue;

    // Generate derived colors
    Color lighterColor = baseColor.lighten(0.2); // Lighten by 20%
    Color darkerColor = baseColor.darken(0.2); // Darken by 20%

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Derived Colors Example'),
          backgroundColor: baseColor,
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Container(
                color: lighterColor,
                height: 100,
                width: 100,
                child: Center(child: Text('Lighter Color')),
              ),
              Container(
                color: darkerColor,
                height: 100,
                width: 100,
                child: Center(child: Text('Darker Color')),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to create lighter and darker versions of a base color and display them in a simple Flutter app.

# Complete Example of Derived Colors in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:derived_colors/derived_colors.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Define a base color
    Color baseColor = Colors.blue;

    // Generate derived colors
    Color lighterColor = baseColor.lighten(0.2); // Lighten by 20%
    Color darkerColor = baseColor.darken(0.2); // Darken by 20%

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Derived Colors Example'),
          backgroundColor: baseColor, // Set app bar color to base color
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Display the lighter color
              Container(
                color: lighterColor, // Set container color to lighter color
                height: 100,
                width: 100,
                child: Center(child: Text('Lighter Color')),
              ),
              // Display the darker color
              Container(
                color: darkerColor, // Set container color to darker color
                height: 100,
                width: 100,
                child: Center(child: Text('Darker Color')),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}
```

// The application starts by running the `main` function, which calls `runApp` with the `RealFlutter` widget.
// Inside the `RealFlutter` widget, we define a base color (blue) and generate two derived colors: a lighter and a darker version.
// The `MaterialApp` widget sets up the app's structure, with a `Scaffold` containing an `AppBar` and a `Center` widget.
// The `AppBar` uses the base color for its background, while the body contains two `Container` widgets.
// Each container displays one of the derived colors, showcasing how the `derived_colors` package can be used to create a visually appealing UI.
// This example illustrates the ease of generating and using derived colors in a Flutter application, enhancing the overall design and user experience.
