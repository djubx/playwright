                    // Dismiss the dialog when the button is pressed
                    Navigator.of(context).pop();
                  },
                ),
              ],
            );
          },
          child: Text('Show Tip Dialog'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user presses the "Show Tip Dialog" button.
// 2. The `showTipDialog` function is called, which displays the tip dialog.
// 3. The user can read the tip and then press the "Dismiss" button.
// 4. When the "Dismiss" button is pressed, the `Navigator.of(context).pop()` function is called, which dismisses the dialog.
// 5. The user is returned to the main screen, where they can press the "Show Tip Dialog" button again to show the tip dialog.

// In summary, the code flows as follows:
// Button press -> Show tip dialog -> Dismiss dialog -> Return to main screen
