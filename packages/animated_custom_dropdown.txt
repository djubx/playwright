# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Animated Custom Dropdown

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `animated_custom_dropdown` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  animated_custom_dropdown: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `animated_custom_dropdown` in your app.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:animated_custom_dropdown/animated_custom_dropdown.dart';
```

2. Create a StatefulWidget to manage the dropdown state:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String? selectedValue;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Animated Custom Dropdown Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: AnimatedCustomDropdown<String>(
          items: ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3'],
          onChanged: (value) {
            setState(() {
              selectedValue = value;
            });
          },
          selectedItem: selectedValue,
          hint: 'Select an option',
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Run your application to see the animated dropdown in action!

# Complete Example of Animated Custom Dropdown

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_custom_dropdown/animated_custom_dropdown.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animated Custom Dropdown',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to hold the selected value from the dropdown
  String? selectedValue;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Animated Custom Dropdown Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: AnimatedCustomDropdown<String>(
          // List of items to display in the dropdown
          items: ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3'],
          // Callback function when an item is selected
          onChanged: (value) {
            setState(() {
              selectedValue = value; // Update the selected value
            });
          },
          selectedItem: selectedValue, // Current selected item
          hint: 'Select an option', // Placeholder text
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets MyApp as the home widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget is created, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 4. Inside RealFlutter, we define a variable 'selectedValue' to keep track of the selected dropdown item.
// 5. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 6. The AnimatedCustomDropdown widget is used to create the dropdown menu.
// 7. The items property contains the options for the dropdown.
// 8. The onChanged callback updates the selectedValue state when an option is selected.
// 9. The selectedItem property displays the currently selected item, and the hint provides a prompt for the user.
