<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Description

The `scroll_to_hide` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to enhance user experience by allowing widgets to hide or show based on the user's scroll actions. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to create a clean and distraction-free interface, such as in chat applications, social media feeds, or any app where content is primarily consumed through scrolling.

## When to Use

You might consider using the `scroll_to_hide` package in the following scenarios:

- **Chat Applications**: To hide the input field when the user scrolls up to view previous messages, providing more screen space for content.
- **Social Media Feeds**: To hide the navigation bar or action buttons when scrolling through posts, allowing users to focus on the content.
- **Long Lists**: In applications with long lists of items, hiding headers or toolbars can improve usability and aesthetics.

## Features

- **Customizable Animation**: The package allows you to customize the animation duration and curve for showing and hiding widgets.
- **Flexible Widget Support**: You can use it with any widget, making it versatile for various UI components.
- **Scroll Controller Integration**: It integrates seamlessly with Flutter's scroll controllers, making it easy to implement in existing applications.

# Tutorial

## Setup Process

To get started with the `scroll_to_hide` package, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     scroll_to_hide: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
   ```

2. **Install the Package**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

     ```groovy
     android {
         ...
         defaultConfig {
             ...
             minSdkVersion 21
         }
     }
     ```

   - **iOS**: No specific configurations are required for iOS, but ensure your deployment target is set appropriately in `ios/Podfile`.

## Using the Package

To use the `scroll_to_hide` package, follow these steps:

1. **Import the Package**:

   ```dart
   import 'package:scroll_to_hide/scroll_to_hide.dart';
   ```

2. **Wrap Your Widgets**: Use the `ScrollToHide` widget to wrap the widget you want to hide/show based on scroll.

   ```dart
   ScrollToHide(
     scrollController: _scrollController,
     child: YourWidget(),
   );
   ```

3. **Scroll Controller**: Create a `ScrollController` to manage the scroll events.

   ```dart
   ScrollController _scrollController = ScrollController();
   ```

4. **Dispose the Controller**: Donâ€™t forget to dispose of the controller in your widget's `dispose` method.

   ```dart
   @override
   void dispose() {
     _scrollController.dispose();
     super.dispose();
   }
   ```

By following these steps, you can easily integrate the `scroll_to_hide` package into your Flutter application and enhance the user experience.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:scroll_to_hide/scroll_to_hide.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Scroll to Hide Example',
      home: ScrollToHideExample(),
    );
  }
}

class ScrollToHideExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ScrollToHideExampleState createState() => _ScrollToHideExampleState();
}

class _ScrollToHideExampleState extends State<ScrollToHideExample> {
  // Create a ScrollController to manage scroll events
  final ScrollController _scrollController = ScrollController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Scroll to Hide Example'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Wrap the input field with ScrollToHide
          ScrollToHide(
            scrollController: _scrollController,
            child: Container(
              color: Colors.blue,
              padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
              child: TextField(
                decoration: InputDecoration(
                  hintText: 'Type a message...',
                  border: OutlineInputBorder(),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ),
          Expanded(
            child: ListView.builder(
              controller: _scrollController, // Attach the controller to the ListView
              itemCount: 50,
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text('Item $index'),
                );
              },
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the ScrollController
    _scrollController.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and home widget.
// 3. ScrollToHideExample is a StatefulWidget that manages the scroll behavior.
// 4. A ScrollController is created to track scroll events.
// 5. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Column with two children:
//    - A TextField wrapped in ScrollToHide, which will hide when scrolling.
//    - A ListView that displays a list of items and uses the same ScrollController.
// 6. When the user scrolls the ListView, the TextField will hide, providing more space for the content.
// 7. The ScrollController is disposed of in the dispose method to free up resources.
```
