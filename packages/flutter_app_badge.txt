# Setting Up and Using `flutter_app_badge`

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up the `flutter_app_badge` package in a Flutter project and demonstrate how to use it effectively.

## Setup Process

### Step 1: Add Dependency

First, add the `flutter_app_badge` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_app_badge: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android

1. **Modify `AndroidManifest.xml`**: Ensure that your app has the necessary permissions to display badges. Add the following permission inside the `<manifest>` tag:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="com.android.launcher.permission.INSTALL_SHORTCUT"/>
   ```

2. **Configure MainActivity**: No additional configuration is typically required for Android.

#### iOS

1. **Modify `Info.plist`**: Add the following key to request permission for displaying badges:

   ```xml
   <key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
   <array>
     <string>fetch</string>
     <string>remote-notification</string>
   </array>
   ```

2. **Enable Push Notifications**: Ensure that your app is configured to receive push notifications, as badges are often used in conjunction with them.

## Using the Package

To use the `flutter_app_badge` package, you will typically interact with the `RealFlutter` class, which provides methods to set, update, and clear badges.

### Basic Usage

- **Set a Badge**: Use `RealFlutter.setBadgeCount(int count)` to set the badge number.
- **Clear a Badge**: Use `RealFlutter.clearBadge()` to remove the badge.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_app_badge/flutter_app_badge.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter App Badge Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: BadgeDemoPage(),
    );
  }
}

class BadgeDemoPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _BadgeDemoPageState createState() => _BadgeDemoPageState();
}

class _BadgeDemoPageState extends State<BadgeDemoPage> {
  int _badgeCount = 0;

  // Method to increment the badge count
  void _incrementBadge() {
    setState(() {
      _badgeCount++;
    });
    RealFlutter.setBadgeCount(_badgeCount); // Set the badge count
  }

  // Method to clear the badge
  void _clearBadge() {
    setState(() {
      _badgeCount = 0;
    });
    RealFlutter.clearBadge(); // Clear the badge
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Badge Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Badge Count: $_badgeCount',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _incrementBadge,
              child: Text('Increment Badge'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 10),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _clearBadge,
              child: Text('Clear Badge'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow:
// 1. The app starts with a main entry point, running MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a home page set to BadgeDemoPage.
// 3. BadgeDemoPage is a stateful widget that manages the badge count state.
// 4. Two methods, _incrementBadge and _clearBadge, are defined to modify the badge count.
// 5. The UI consists of a text displaying the current badge count and two buttons.
// 6. Pressing "Increment Badge" increases the badge count and updates the app badge.
// 7. Pressing "Clear Badge" resets the badge count and clears the app badge.
// 8. The RealFlutter class is used to interact with the badge functionality, setting and clearing badges as needed.
