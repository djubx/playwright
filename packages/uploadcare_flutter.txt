# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Uploadcare in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `uploadcare_flutter` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `uploadcare_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  uploadcare_flutter: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Configure for Android

For Android, you need to ensure that your app has the necessary permissions to access the device's storage. Open the `AndroidManifest.xml` file located in `android/app/src/main/` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

## Step 3: Configure for iOS

For iOS, you need to add the following permissions in your `Info.plist` file located in `ios/Runner/`:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to upload images.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to take photos.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone to record videos.</string>
```

## Step 4: Initialize Uploadcare

Before using the package, you need to initialize it with your Uploadcare public key. You can do this in your main application file:

```dart
import 'package:uploadcare_flutter/uploadcare_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  Uploadcare.init('YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY'); // Replace with your Uploadcare public key
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 5: Using the Package

You can now use the `Uploadcare` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a file upload feature:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:uploadcare_flutter/uploadcare_flutter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Uploadcare Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: UploadcareWidget(
            onFileUploaded: (file) {
              // Handle the uploaded file
              print('File uploaded: ${file.url}');
            },
            onError: (error) {
              // Handle errors
              print('Error: $error');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `UploadcareWidget` allows users to upload files, and you can handle the uploaded file or any errors that occur during the upload process.

# Complete Example of Uploadcare in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:uploadcare_flutter/uploadcare_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize Uploadcare with your public key
  Uploadcare.init('YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY'); // Replace with your Uploadcare public key
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Uploadcare Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: UploadcareWidget(
            onFileUploaded: (file) {
              // This callback is triggered when a file is successfully uploaded
              print('File uploaded: ${file.url}');
            },
            onError: (error) {
              // This callback is triggered when an error occurs during upload
              print('Error: $error');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Uploadcare package with a public key.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which builds the main application UI.
// 3. The UploadcareWidget is displayed in the center of the screen.
// 4. When a user uploads a file, the onFileUploaded callback is triggered, 
//    printing the uploaded file's URL to the console.
// 5. If an error occurs during the upload, the onError callback is triggered, 
//    printing the error message to the console.
```
