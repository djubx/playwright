# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Native PDF View Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `native_pdf_view` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the `native_pdf_view` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  native_pdf_view: ^4.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    compileSdkVersion 31  // or the latest version
    ...
}

dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'com.github.barteksc:android-pdf-viewer:3.2.0-beta.1' // Required for PDF rendering
}
```

2. Ensure you have the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. Ensure you have the latest iOS deployment target set in `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or the latest version
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple Flutter application that displays a PDF file.

1. Create a new Dart file, e.g., `pdf_viewer.dart`, and import the necessary packages:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:native_pdf_view/native_pdf_view.dart';
```

2. Create the main widget:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'PDF Viewer',
      home: PDFViewPage(),
    );
  }
}

class PDFViewPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PDFViewPageState createState() => _PDFViewPageState();
}

class _PDFViewPageState extends State<PDFViewPage> {
  late PDFViewController controller;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('PDF Viewer'),
      ),
      body: PDFView(
        filePath: 'assets/sample.pdf', // Path to your PDF file
        onViewCreated: (PDFViewController pdfViewController) {
          controller = pdfViewController;
        },
        onPageChanged: (int page) {
          print('Page changed to: $page');
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Finally, run your application:

```bash
flutter run
```

This will display a PDF viewer with the specified PDF file.

# Complete Example of Using Native PDF View

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:native_pdf_view/native_pdf_view.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'PDF Viewer',
      home: PDFViewPage(),
    );
  }
}

class PDFViewPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PDFViewPageState createState() => _PDFViewPageState();
}

class _PDFViewPageState extends State<PDFViewPage> {
  late PDFViewController controller; // Controller to manage PDF view

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('PDF Viewer'), // Title of the app bar
      ),
      body: PDFView(
        filePath: 'assets/sample.pdf', // Path to your PDF file
        onViewCreated: (PDFViewController pdfViewController) {
          controller = pdfViewController; // Initialize the controller
        },
        onPageChanged: (int page) {
          print('Page changed to: $page'); // Log the current page
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The home of the app is set to PDFViewPage, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 3. In the PDFViewPage, we create a PDFView widget that takes the path of the PDF file.
// 4. The onViewCreated callback initializes the PDFViewController, allowing us to control the PDF view.
// 5. The onPageChanged callback logs the current page number whenever the user navigates to a different page.
// 6. The PDF file should be placed in the assets folder, and the path should be correctly specified in the filePath property.
```
