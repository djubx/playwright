# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using pin_code_view

## Installation
To get started with the `pin_code_view` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  pin_code_view: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `pin_code_view` package, you can create a simple PIN input widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pin_code_view/pin_code_view.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('PIN Code Input')),
        body: Center(
          child: PinCodeView(
            length: 4, // Length of the PIN code
            onChanged: (value) {
              // Handle the input value
              print("Current PIN: $value");
            },
            onCompleted: (value) {
              // Handle the completed PIN code
              print("Completed PIN: $value");
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic PIN code input field with a length of 4 digits. The `onChanged` and `onCompleted` callbacks allow you to handle user input effectively.

## Conclusion
The `pin_code_view` package is easy to set up and provides a customizable solution for PIN code input in Flutter applications. Make sure to explore its features to enhance your app's user experience.

# Complete Example of pin_code_view

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pin_code_view/pin_code_view.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('PIN Code Input Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: PinCodeView(
            length: 4, // Set the length of the PIN code
            onChanged: (value) {
              // This callback is triggered whenever the input changes
              print("Current PIN: $value");
            },
            onCompleted: (value) {
              // This callback is triggered when the user completes the input
              print("Completed PIN: $value");
              // Here you can add logic to verify the PIN code
            },
            // Customizing the appearance of the PIN code input
            pinTheme: PinTheme(
              shape: PinCodeFieldShape.box,
              borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(5),
              fieldHeight: 50,
              fieldWidth: 40,
              activeFillColor: Colors.blue[100],
              inactiveFillColor: Colors.grey[300],
              selectedFillColor: Colors.blue[200],
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which builds a MaterialApp.
// 2. The home of the app is a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, a PinCodeView is created with a length of 4.
// 4. The onChanged callback prints the current input value to the console.
// 5. The onCompleted callback prints the completed PIN code and can be used to verify the input.
// 6. The appearance of the PIN input fields is customized using the pinTheme property.
