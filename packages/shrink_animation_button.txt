# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using shrink_animation_button

## Installation
To use the `shrink_animation_button` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  shrink_animation_button: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Usage
### Basic Setup
To use the `shrink_animation_button`, you need to import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:shrink_animation_button/shrink_animation_button.dart';
```

### Example Implementation
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a shrink animation button in your Flutter app:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:shrink_animation_button/shrink_animation_button.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Shrink Animation Button Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ShrinkAnimationButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Action to perform on button press
              print('Button Pressed!');
            },
            child: Text('Press Me'),
            // Customize button properties
            color: Colors.blue,
            textColor: Colors.white,
            duration: Duration(milliseconds: 200),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

### Platform-Specific Details
- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid compatibility issues.
- **iOS**: No specific configurations are required, but ensure your deployment target is set appropriately in `ios/Podfile`.

### Optimizations
- Consider using the `duration` property to adjust the animation speed based on your app's design requirements.
- Test the button on various devices to ensure the animation feels smooth and responsive.

With these steps, you can easily integrate the `shrink_animation_button` into your Flutter application and enhance the user experience with animated buttons.

# Complete Example of shrink_animation_button

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:shrink_animation_button/shrink_animation_button.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Shrink Animation Button Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ShrinkAnimationButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Action to perform on button press
              print('Button Pressed!');
            },
            child: Text('Press Me'),
            // Customize button properties
            color: Colors.blue,
            textColor: Colors.white,
            duration: Duration(milliseconds: 200),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, a ShrinkAnimationButton is created.
// 4. The button has an onPressed callback that prints 'Button Pressed!' to the console when tapped.
// 5. The button's appearance is customized with a blue background and white text, and the animation duration is set to 200 milliseconds.
// 6. When the button is pressed, it shrinks, providing visual feedback to the user, enhancing the overall user experience.
