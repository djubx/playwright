# KLC Flutter Package: A Comprehensive Overview

The **KLC** (Kotlin Language Converter) Flutter package is designed to facilitate the conversion of Kotlin code snippets into Dart, making it easier for developers transitioning from Android development to Flutter. This package is particularly useful for developers who are familiar with Kotlin and want to leverage their existing knowledge while building Flutter applications.

## When to Use KLC
- **Transitioning from Android to Flutter**: If you are an Android developer with a strong background in Kotlin, KLC can help you convert your existing Kotlin code into Dart, easing the learning curve.
- **Code Reusability**: When you have Kotlin code that you want to reuse or adapt for a Flutter application, KLC can streamline this process.
- **Learning Tool**: It serves as a great educational resource for understanding how Kotlin constructs translate into Dart.

## Features
- **Kotlin to Dart Conversion**: The primary feature of KLC is its ability to convert Kotlin code snippets into equivalent Dart code.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: The package provides syntax highlighting for better readability of the converted code.
- **Error Handling**: KLC includes error handling mechanisms to notify users of any issues during the conversion process.
- **Customizable Output**: Users can customize the output format of the converted code to suit their coding style.

Overall, KLC is a valuable tool for developers looking to bridge the gap between Kotlin and Dart, enhancing productivity and code quality in Flutter projects.

# KLC Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the KLC package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  klc: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your project is set up to use Kotlin. You can do this by checking your `android/app/build.gradle` file. It should include:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    kotlinOptions {
        jvmTarget = "1.8"
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, there are no specific configurations required for KLC. Just ensure that your Flutter environment is set up correctly.

## Basic Usage
Here’s how to use the KLC package in your Flutter application:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:klc/klc.dart';
```

2. Use the `KlcConverter` class to convert Kotlin code to Dart:

```dart
void main() {
  String kotlinCode = """
  fun main() {
      println("Hello, World!")
  }
  """;

  String dartCode = KlcConverter.convert(kotlinCode);
  print(dartCode);
}
```

This will convert the provided Kotlin code into Dart and print it to the console.

## Additional Configuration
You may want to handle errors during conversion. Here’s how you can implement basic error handling:

```dart
try {
  String dartCode = KlcConverter.convert(kotlinCode);
  print(dartCode);
} catch (e) {
  print("Error converting Kotlin to Dart: $e");
}
```

This will catch any exceptions thrown during the conversion process and print an error message.

# Complete Example of KLC in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:klc/klc.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {

// The above code defines a simple Flutter application using the KLC package.
// 1. The `main` function initializes the app by calling `runApp` with the `RealFlutter` widget.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 4. When the button is pressed, a Kotlin code snippet is defined.
// 5. The `KlcConverter.convert` method is called to convert the Kotlin code to Dart.
// 6. If the conversion is successful, the converted Dart code is displayed in an AlertDialog.
// 7. If an error occurs during conversion, an error message is shown in another AlertDialog.
// 8. The user can close the dialog by pressing the 'Close' button.

// This application demonstrates how to use the KLC package to convert Kotlin code to Dart and handle potential errors gracefully.
