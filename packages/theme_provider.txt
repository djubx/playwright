# Exploring the `theme_provider` Flutter Package

The `theme_provider` package is a powerful tool for managing themes in Flutter applications. It allows developers to easily switch between different themes at runtime, providing a seamless user experience. This package is particularly useful for applications that require dynamic theming based on user preferences or system settings.

## When to Use `theme_provider`
- **Dynamic Theming**: When your application needs to support multiple themes that can be switched at runtime.
- **User Preferences**: If you want to allow users to customize the look and feel of your app according to their preferences.
- **Dark/Light Mode**: To implement dark and light modes based on user selection or system settings.

## Key Features
- **Easy Theme Switching**: Switch between themes with minimal code.
- **Persistent Theme**: Save the user's theme preference using shared preferences.
- **Custom Themes**: Create and manage custom themes easily.
- **Integration with Flutter's Material Design**: Works seamlessly with Flutter's built-in theming capabilities.

Overall, `theme_provider` simplifies the process of managing themes in Flutter applications, making it a valuable addition to any developer's toolkit.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `theme_provider`

## Installation
To get started with the `theme_provider` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  theme_provider: ^5.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No specific configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if you plan to use features that require user permissions.

## Basic Usage
1. **Import the Package**: Start by importing the package in your Dart file.
   ```dart
   import 'package:theme_provider/theme_provider.dart';
   ```

2. **Wrap Your App**: Use `ThemeProvider` to wrap your main application widget.
   ```dart
   void main() {
     runApp(
       ThemeProvider(
         saveThemesOnChange: true,
         themes: [
           AppTheme.light(),
           AppTheme.dark(),
         ],
         child: RealFlutter(),
       ),
     );
   }
   ```

3. **Accessing Themes**: You can access the current theme and switch themes using the `ThemeProvider` methods.
   ```dart
   ThemeProvider.controllerOf(context).setTheme('dark');
   ```

4. **Using Theme Data**: Access theme data in your widgets.
   ```dart
   final theme = ThemeProvider.themeOf(context).data;
   ```

With these steps, you can easily implement dynamic theming in your Flutter application using the `theme_provider` package.

# Complete Example of `theme_provider`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:theme_provider/theme_provider.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    ThemeProvider(
      saveThemesOnChange: true, // Save the theme preference
      themes: [
        // Define light and dark themes
        AppTheme.light(), // Light theme
        AppTheme.dark(),  // Dark theme
      ],
      child: RealFlutter(), // Main application widget
    ),
  );
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Theme Provider Example',
      theme: ThemeProvider.themeOf(context).data, // Get current theme data
      home: HomeScreen(), // Home screen of the app
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Theme Provider Example'),
        actions: [
          // Button to toggle between themes
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.brightness_6),
            onPressed: () {
              // Toggle theme on button press
              ThemeProvider.controllerOf(context).nextTheme();
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Press the button to switch themes!',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and wraps it with ThemeProvider.
// 2. ThemeProvider is configured with light and dark themes and saves user preferences.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget builds the MaterialApp using the current theme data.
// 4. The HomeScreen widget displays a button in the app bar to toggle between themes.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the nextTheme method is called, switching the theme.
// 6. The app updates the UI to reflect the selected theme, providing a dynamic experience.
