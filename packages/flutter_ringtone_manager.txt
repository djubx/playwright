# flutter_ringtone_manager: Setup and Usage Tutorial

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_ringtone_manager` package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_ringtone_manager` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_ringtone_manager: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file. Add the following lines within the `<manifest>` tag:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
   ```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Make sure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to add the following key to your `Info.plist` file to request permission to access the user's media library:

```xml
<key>NSAppleMusicUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your music library.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to play a ringtone:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_ringtone_manager/flutter_ringtone_manager.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Ringtone Manager Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Play the default ringtone
              await FlutterRingtoneManager.playRingtone();
            },
            child: Text('Play Ringtone'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, the default ringtone will play. You can also explore other methods provided by the package to access different types of sounds.

                  // Play the default notification sound
                  await FlutterRingtoneManager.playNotification();
                },
                child: Text('Play Notification Sound'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () async {
                  // Play the default alarm sound
                  await FlutterRingtoneManager.playAlarm();
                },
                child: Text('Play Alarm Sound'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

/*
  Application Flow Explanation:
  1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
  2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
  3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds a Column.
  4. Inside the Column, there are three ElevatedButtons:
     - The first button plays the default ringtone when pressed.
     - The second button plays the default notification sound.
     - The third button plays the default alarm sound.
  5. Each button triggers an asynchronous function that calls the respective method from the flutter_ringtone_manager package to play the sound.
  6. The user can interact with the buttons to hear different sounds, demonstrating the package's functionality.
