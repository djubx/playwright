# Setting Up the Package
-------------------------

To use the `responsive_toolkit` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Here are the steps:

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

```
### Step 2: Import the Package

```
### Step 3: Use the Package

You can now use the package in your Flutter app. Here is an example:

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ResponsiveBuilder(
      builder: (context, size) {
        if (size.isMobile) {
          return MobileLayout();
        } else {
          return DesktopLayout();
        }
      },

```xml
<application
  ...
  android:configChanges="orientation|screenSize"

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:responsive_toolkit/responsive_toolkit.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Responsive Toolkit Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Use the ResponsiveBuilder to build a responsive layout
    return ResponsiveBuilder(
      builder: (context, size) {
        // Check if the screen size is mobile
        if (size.isMobile) {
          // Return the mobile layout
          return MobileLayout();
        } else {
          // Return the desktop layout
          return DesktopLayout();
        }
      },
    );
  }
}

class MobileLayout extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Build a mobile-specific layout
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Mobile Layout'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('This is a mobile layout'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DesktopLayout extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Build a desktop-specific layout
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Desktop Layout'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('This is a desktop layout'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app on a device with a specific screen size.
// 2. The ResponsiveBuilder checks the screen size and determines whether it is mobile or desktop.
// 3. Based on the screen size, the ResponsiveBuilder returns either the MobileLayout or the DesktopLayout.
// 4. The MobileLayout or DesktopLayout is then built and displayed on the screen.
// 5. The user can interact with the layout, and the app responds accordingly.

// This code demonstrates how to use the Responsive Toolkit package to build a responsive app that adapts to different screen sizes.
