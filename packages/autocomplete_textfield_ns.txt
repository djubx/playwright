# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Autocomplete TextField NS

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `autocomplete_textfield_ns` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `autocomplete_textfield_ns` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  autocomplete_textfield_ns: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement an autocomplete text field.

# Complete Example of Autocomplete TextField NS

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:autocomplete_textfield_ns/autocomplete_textfield_ns.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Autocomplete TextField Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Create a GlobalKey for the AutoCompleteTextField
  GlobalKey<AutoCompleteTextFieldState<String>> key = GlobalKey();
  
  // Sample data for suggestions
  List<String> suggestions = [
    "Apple",
    "Banana",
    "Cherry",
    "Date",
    "Fig",
    "Grape",
    "Honeydew"
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Autocomplete TextField Example'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            // AutoCompleteTextField widget
            AutoCompleteTextField<String>(
              key: key,
              suggestions: suggestions,
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                hintText: "Type a fruit name",
                border: OutlineInputBorder(),
              ),
              itemSubmitted: (item) {
                // Action when an item is selected
                print("You selected: $item");
              },
              itemBuilder: (context, item) {
                // Build the suggestion item
                return Padding(
                  padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
                  child: Text(item),
                );
              },
              // Function to filter suggestions based on user input
              itemFilter: (item, query) {
                return item.toLowerCase().startsWith(query.toLowerCase());
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application using the autocomplete_textfield_ns package.
// 
// 1. **Main Function**: The entry point of the application, where the MyApp widget is run.
// 2. **MyApp Widget**: A StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home page.
// 3. **RealFlutter Widget**: A StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the autocomplete text field.
// 4. **GlobalKey**: Used to manage the state of the AutoCompleteTextField.
// 5. **Sample Data**: A list of fruit names that will be used as suggestions.
// 6. **Scaffold**: Provides the basic structure of the app, including an AppBar and body.
// 7. **AutoCompleteTextField**: The main widget that provides the autocomplete functionality.
//    - **suggestions**: The list of items to suggest.
//    - **decoration**: Customizes the appearance of the text field.
//    - **itemSubmitted**: Callback when a user selects an item from the suggestions.
//    - **itemBuilder**: Defines how each suggestion item is displayed.
//    - **itemFilter**: Filters the suggestions based on user input.
// 
// The application flow allows users to type in the text field, and as they type, suggestions appear based on the predefined list. When a user selects a suggestion, it is printed to the console.
