# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `assets_audio_player_web`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `assets_audio_player_web` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  assets_audio_player_web: ^3.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Configuring for Android and iOS

### Android Configuration
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration
For iOS, you may need to add the following permissions in your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file to allow audio playback:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio playback.</string>
<key>NSAppleMusicUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your music library for audio playback.</string>
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:assets_audio_player_web/assets_audio_player_web.dart';
```

## Step 4: Basic Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the `assets_audio_player_web` package to play an audio file from your assets:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: AudioPlayerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class AudioPlayerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _AudioPlayerScreenState createState() => _AudioPlayerScreenState();
}

class _AudioPlayerScreenState extends State<AudioPlayerScreen> {
  final AssetsAudioPlayer _audioPlayer = AssetsAudioPlayer();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _audioPlayer.open(Audio("assets/audio/sample.mp3")); // Load audio file
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _audioPlayer.dispose(); // Dispose of the player when not needed
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Audio Player")),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () => _audioPlayer.play(), // Play audio
              child: Text("Play"),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () => _audioPlayer.pause(), // Pause audio
              child: Text("Pause"),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () => _audioPlayer.stop(), // Stop audio
              child: Text("Stop"),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple audio player with play, pause, and stop functionalities. The audio file is loaded from the assets folder.

# Complete Example of `assets_audio_player_web`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:assets_audio_player_web/assets_audio_player_web.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: AudioPlayerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class AudioPlayerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _AudioPlayerScreenState createState() => _AudioPlayerScreenState();
}

class _AudioPlayerScreenState extends State<AudioPlayerScreen> {
  // Create an instance of AssetsAudioPlayer
  final AssetsAudioPlayer _audioPlayer = AssetsAudioPlayer();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Open an audio file from assets
    _audioPlayer.open(Audio("assets/audio/sample.mp3"));
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the audio player when the widget is removed from the widget tree
    _audioPlayer.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Audio Player")),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Play the audio
                _audioPlayer.play();
              },
              child: Text("Play"),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Pause the audio
                _audioPlayer.pause();
              },
              child: Text("Pause"),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Stop the audio
                _audioPlayer.stop();
              },
              child: Text("Stop"),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds the MaterialApp and sets AudioPlayerScreen as the home widget.
// 3. AudioPlayerScreen initializes an instance of AssetsAudioPlayer.
// 4. In initState, it opens an audio file located in the assets folder.
// 5. The build method creates a simple UI with three buttons: Play, Pause, and Stop.
// 6. Each button triggers the corresponding method on the audio player instance to control playback.
// 7. When the widget is disposed, the audio player is also disposed to free up resources.
```
