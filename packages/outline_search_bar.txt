# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Outline Search Bar

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `outline_search_bar` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `outline_search_bar` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  outline_search_bar: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Outline Search Bar

Now that we have set up the package, let's implement it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to use the `outline_search_bar` in a Flutter app.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:outline_search_bar/outline_search_bar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Outline Search Bar Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: SearchPage(),
    );
  }
}

class SearchPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SearchPageState createState() => _SearchPageState();
}

class _SearchPageState extends State<SearchPage> {
  // List of items to search through
  final List<String> items = [
    'Apple',
    'Banana',
    'Cherry',
    'Date',
    'Elderberry',
    'Fig',
    'Grape',
    'Honeydew',
  ];

  // This will hold the filtered results
  List<String> filteredItems = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initially, display all items
    filteredItems = items;
  }

  // Method to filter items based on the search query
  void _filterItems(String query) {
    if (query.isEmpty) {
      // If the query is empty, show all items
      setState(() {
        filteredItems = items;
      });
    } else {
      // Filter the items based on the query
      setState(() {
        filteredItems = items
            .where((item) => item.toLowerCase().contains(query.toLowerCase()))
            .toList();
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Outline Search Bar Example'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Outline Search Bar
          OutlineSearchBar(
            onChanged: _filterItems, // Call the filter method on change
            hintText: 'Search fruits...',
          ),
          // Display the filtered items
          Expanded(
            child: ListView.builder(
              itemCount: filteredItems.length,
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text(filteredItems[index]),
                );
              },
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application using the outline_search_bar package.
// 
// 1. **Main Function**: The `main` function initializes the app by running the `RealFlutter` widget.
// 
// 2. **RealFlutter Class**: This is the main widget of the application, which sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 
// 3. **SearchPage Class**: This stateful widget contains the search functionality.
// 
// 4. **State Management**: The `_SearchPageState` class manages the list of items and the filtered results.
// 
// 5. **initState Method**: Initializes the filteredItems list to show all items when the app starts.
// 
// 6. **_filterItems Method**: This method filters the items based on the user's search query. It updates the filteredItems list accordingly.
// 
// 7. **Build Method**: The build method constructs the UI, including the OutlineSearchBar and a ListView to display the filtered results.
// 
// 8. **OutlineSearchBar**: The search bar calls the `_filterItems` method whenever the text changes, allowing for real-time filtering of the list.
// 
// 9. **ListView**: Displays the filtered items dynamically as the user types in the search bar.
