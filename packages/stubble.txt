# Stubble Flutter Package: A Comprehensive Overview

The **Stubble** package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to implement a robust templating engine in their applications. It allows for the dynamic generation of UI components based on templates, making it easier to manage complex layouts and data-driven interfaces. 

## When to Use Stubble
Stubble is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to render dynamic content based on user input or external data sources. For example, if you're building a chat application, you can use Stubble to create message templates that adapt based on the sender, message type, or other contextual information.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Templating**: Easily create templates that can be populated with data at runtime.
- **Customizable**: Supports custom functions and helpers to extend its functionality.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead, making it suitable for performance-sensitive applications.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate into existing Flutter projects without extensive setup.

With these features, Stubble stands out as a versatile package for developers looking to enhance their Flutter applications with dynamic content rendering capabilities.

# Stubble Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the Stubble package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  stubble: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use Stubble in your Flutter application, you will typically follow these steps:

1. **Import the package**:
   ```dart
   import 'package:stubble/stubble.dart';
   ```

2. **Create a template**:
   Define a template string that includes placeholders for dynamic data.
   ```dart
   String template = 'Hello, {{name}}! Welcome to {{place}}.';
   ```

3. **Render the template**:
   Use the Stubble engine to render the template with actual data.
   ```dart
   var stubble = Stubble();
   var rendered = stubble.render(template, {'name': 'Alice', 'place': 'Flutter'});
   print(rendered); // Output: Hello, Alice! Welcome to Flutter.
   ```

With these steps, you can start using Stubble to create dynamic content in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Stubble in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:stubble/stubble.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Stubble Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Stubble Flutter Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: TemplateRenderer(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class TemplateRenderer extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Define a template with placeholders
    String template = 'Hello, {{name}}! Welcome to {{place}}.';

    // Create an instance of Stubble
    var stubble = Stubble();

    // Prepare the data to fill the template
    var data = {
      'name': 'Alice',
      'place': 'Flutter'
    };

    // Render the template with the provided data
    var rendered = stubble.render(template, data);

    // Display the rendered output in a Text widget
    return Text(
      rendered,
      style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a centered TemplateRenderer widget.
// 3. TemplateRenderer defines a string template with placeholders for dynamic data.
// 4. An instance of Stubble is created to handle the rendering of the template.
// 5. A map of data is prepared, which includes the values for the placeholders in the template.
// 6. The template is rendered using the Stubble instance, filling in the placeholders with the provided data.
// 7. The rendered string is displayed in a Text widget, which is shown in the center of the screen.
