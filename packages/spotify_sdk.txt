# Spotify SDK Flutter Package

The `spotify_sdk` Flutter package is a powerful tool that allows developers to integrate Spotify's music streaming capabilities into their Flutter applications. This package provides a seamless way to interact with the Spotify app on both Android and iOS devices, enabling functionalities such as playing music, controlling playback, and accessing user playlists.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `spotify_sdk` package when you want to build applications that require music streaming features, such as:

- Music discovery apps that leverage Spotify's extensive library.
- Social apps that allow users to share and listen to music together.
- Personal music players that integrate with Spotify for enhanced functionality.

## Key Features

- **Playback Control**: Start, pause, skip, and seek tracks.
- **User Authentication**: Authenticate users via Spotify to access their playlists and saved tracks.
- **Track Information**: Retrieve details about currently playing tracks, including title, artist, and album.
- **Playlist Management**: Access and manage user playlists directly from your app.

The `spotify_sdk` package is a great choice for developers looking to enhance their Flutter applications with music streaming capabilities, providing a rich set of features that integrate well with the Spotify ecosystem.

# Tutorial: Setting Up the Spotify SDK in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `spotify_sdk` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `spotify_sdk` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  spotify_sdk: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/spotify_sdk).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions and metadata:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>

<application>
    ...
    <meta-data
        android:name="com.spotify.sdk.android.clientId"
        android:value="YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID"/>
    <meta-data
        android:name="com.spotify.sdk.android.redirectUri"
        android:value="YOUR_SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI"/>
</application>
```

Replace `YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` and `YOUR_SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI` with your actual Spotify app credentials.

2. **Enable Spotify App Links**: Ensure that your app can handle Spotify links by adding an intent filter:

```xml
<intent-filter>
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW"/>
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT"/>
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE"/>
    <data android:scheme="YOUR_SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI_SCHEME" />
</intent-filter>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following entries:

```xml
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
    <dict>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
        <array>
            <string>YOUR_SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI_SCHEME</string>
        </array>
    </dict>
</array>
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

Replace `YOUR_SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI_SCHEME` with your actual redirect URI scheme.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have configured the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. Below is a complete example demonstrating how to authenticate a user and control playback.

# Complete Example: Spotify SDK in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:spotify_sdk/spotify_sdk.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Spotify SDK Example',
      home: SpotifyHome(),
    );
  }
}

class SpotifyHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SpotifyHomeState createState() => _SpotifyHomeState();
}

class _SpotifyHomeState extends State<SpotifyHome> {
  String _trackName = 'No track playing';
  String _artistName = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _connectToSpotify();
  }

  // Connect to Spotify and authenticate the user
  Future<void> _connectToSpotify() async {
    try {
      // Authenticate the user
      final result = await SpotifySdk.connectToSpotifyRemote(
        clientId: 'YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID',
        redirectUrl: 'YOUR_SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI',
      );

      // Check if the connection was successful
      if (result) {
        _getCurrentTrack();
      }
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error connecting to Spotify: $e');
    }
  }

  // Get the currently playing track
  Future<void> _getCurrentTrack() async {
    try {
      final track = await SpotifySdk.getCurrentTrack();
      setState(() {
        _trackName = track.name;
        _artistName = track.artist;
      });
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error getting current track: $e');
    }
  }

  // Play a specific track
  Future<void> _playTrack(String trackUri) async {
    try {
      await SpotifySdk.play(trackUri: trackUri);
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error playing track: $e');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Spotify SDK Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Currently Playing:'),
            Text(_trackName),
            Text('by $_artistName'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () => _playTrack('spotify:track:YOUR_TRACK_URI'),
              child: Text('Play Track'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application that integrates with the Spotify SDK.
// 
// 1. **Main Entry Point**: The `main` function initializes the app by running the `RealFlutter` widget.
// 
// 2. **RealFlutter Widget**: This is the root widget of the application, setting up the MaterialApp with a title and home page.
// 
// 3. **SpotifyHome Widget**: This stateful widget manages the Spotify connection and playback.
// 
// 4. **initState**: When the widget is first created, it calls `_connectToSpotify` to authenticate the user and connect to the Spotify app.
// 
// 5. **_connectToSpotify**: This method attempts to connect to the Spotify remote. If successful, it retrieves the currently playing track.
// 
// 6. **_getCurrentTrack**: This method fetches the current track's details and updates the UI with the track name and artist.
// 
// 7. **_playTrack**: This method plays a specific track using its URI. You need to replace 'YOUR_TRACK_URI' with an actual Spotify track URI.
// 
// 8. **UI Layout**: The UI consists of a simple layout displaying the currently playing track and a button to play a specific track.
// 
// Overall, this application demonstrates how to connect to Spotify, retrieve the current track, and control playback using the `spotify_sdk` package.
