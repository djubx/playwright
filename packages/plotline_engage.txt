# Setting Up and Using the plotline_engage Package

## Installation
To get started with the `plotline_engage` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and include the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  plotline_engage: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/plotline_engage).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add any necessary permissions or configurations required by the package.

## Basic Usage
To use the `plotline_engage` package, you will typically start by initializing the main class and setting up your content. Here’s a simple example of how to do this:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:plotline_engage/plotline_engage.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Plotline Engage Example',
      home: PlotlineHome(),
    );
  }
}

class PlotlineHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PlotlineHomeState createState() => _PlotlineHomeState();
}

class _PlotlineHomeState extends State<PlotlineHome> {
  // Initialize your plotline content here

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Plotline Engage')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to Plotline Engage!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application with the `plotline_engage` package. You can expand upon this by adding interactive elements and dynamic content based on user choices.

# Complete Example of Using plotline_engage

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:plotline_engage/plotline_engage.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Plotline Engage Example',
      home: PlotlineHome(),
    );
  }
}

class PlotlineHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PlotlineHomeState createState() => _PlotlineHomeState();
}

class _PlotlineHomeState extends State<PlotlineHome> {
  // Initialize your plotline content here
  late Plotline plotline;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Create a new plotline instance
    plotline = Plotline(
      title: 'Adventure Awaits',
      content: [
        'You find yourself in a dark forest. What do you do?',
        '1. Explore deeper into the forest.',
        '2. Turn back and find a way out.',
      ],
      choices: [
        () => setState(() {
          plotline.updateContent('You bravely venture deeper into the forest...');
        }),
        () => setState(() {
          plotline.updateContent('You decide it’s best to turn back...');
        }),
      ],
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text(plotline.title)),
      body: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: [
          // Display the current content of the plotline
          for (var line in plotline.content) Text(line),
          // Display choices as buttons
          for (var i = 0; i < plotline.choices.length; i++)
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: plotline.choices[i],
              child: Text('Choice ${i + 1}'),
            ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp and points to the PlotlineHome widget.
// 3. In PlotlineHome, we initialize a Plotline instance with a title, content, and choices.
// 4. The content is displayed in a column, and each choice is represented as a button.
// 5. When a button is pressed, the corresponding choice updates the content dynamically.
// 6. The app allows users to interact with the narrative, making choices that affect the storyline.
