# Setting Up and Using `flutter_super`

## Installation
To get started with `flutter_super`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_super: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_super).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
Once you have installed the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a state management feature using `flutter_super`.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_super/flutter_super.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we import the `flutter_super` package and create a basic Flutter application that uses the `RealFlutter` class as the home widget. 

Make sure to explore the official documentation for more advanced features and configurations.

# Complete Example of `flutter_super`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_super/flutter_super.dart';

// Main entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// MyApp widget that serves as the root of the application
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Super Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(), // Setting RealFlutter as the home widget
    );
  }
}

// RealFlutter widget demonstrating the use of flutter_super
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // State variable to hold the count
  int _count = 0;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Super Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'You have pushed the button this many times:',
            ),
            // Displaying the count
            Text(
              '$_count',
              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline4,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: _incrementCounter, // Increment counter on button press
        tooltip: 'Increment',
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Method to increment the counter
  void _incrementCounter() {
    setState(() {
      _count++; // Updating the state
    });
  }
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main() function, which runs the MyApp widget.
2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp and defines the theme and home widget (RealFlutter).
3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains a count state.
4. The build method of RealFlutter constructs the UI, displaying the current count and a button.
5. When the FloatingActionButton is pressed, the _incrementCounter method is called.
6. _incrementCounter updates the state, which triggers a rebuild of the UI to reflect the new count.
