# Setting Up and Using the `utils_plus` Package

## Installation

To get started with the `utils_plus` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  utils_plus: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android
For Android, no additional configuration is required. The package works out of the box.

### iOS
Similarly, for iOS, no special configurations are needed. Just ensure that your iOS deployment target is set to a version compatible with Flutter.

## Basic Usage

To use the `utils_plus` package, you need to import it into your Dart files:

```dart
import 'package:utils_plus/utils_plus.dart';
```

You can then access its various utility functions. For example, to format a date:

```dart
String formattedDate = DateUtils.formatDate(DateTime.now(), 'yyyy-MM-dd');
```

This will give you a string representation of the current date in the specified format.

### Example Usage

Hereâ€™s a quick example of how to use some of the features:

```dart
void main() {
  String email = "example@domain.com";
  bool isValidEmail = Validator.isEmail(email);
  print("Is valid email: $isValidEmail"); // Output: Is valid email: true
}
```

This snippet checks if the provided email is valid using the `Validator` class from `utils_plus`.

# Complete Example of Using `utils_plus`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:utils_plus/utils_plus.dart'; // Importing the utils_plus package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the RealFlutter app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Utils Plus Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Utils Plus Demo'), // App bar title
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying the formatted date
              Text(
                'Formatted Date: ${DateUtils.formatDate(DateTime.now(), 'yyyy-MM-dd')}',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Validating an email address
              Text(
                'Is valid email: ${Validator.isEmail("example@domain.com")}',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Formatting a number as currency
              Text(
                'Formatted Currency: ${NumberUtils.formatCurrency(12345.67)}',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, a Center widget is used to center the content vertically and horizontally.
// 4. A Column widget is used to arrange the Text widgets vertically.
// 5. The first Text widget displays the current date formatted as 'yyyy-MM-dd' using the DateUtils class.
// 6. The second Text widget checks if a given email is valid using the Validator class and displays the result.
// 7. The third Text widget formats a number as currency using the NumberUtils class and displays it.
// 8. The app showcases the utility functions provided by the utils_plus package in a simple and effective manner.
