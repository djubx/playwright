# Overview of the `swipe_to_action` Flutter Package

The `swipe_to_action` package is a powerful Flutter library that allows developers to implement swipe gestures on list items, enabling users to perform actions such as delete, edit, or archive with a simple swipe. This package is particularly useful in applications that require quick interactions with list items, such as to-do lists, email clients, or messaging apps.

## When to Use `swipe_to_action`

You should consider using the `swipe_to_action` package when:
- You want to enhance user experience by providing intuitive swipe gestures.
- Your application involves lists where users frequently need to perform actions on individual items.
- You aim to reduce the number of taps required to perform common actions, making your app feel more responsive.

## Features
- **Customizable Actions**: Define multiple actions for swipe gestures, allowing for a flexible user interface.
- **Animation Support**: Smooth animations enhance the visual feedback when swiping.
- **Platform Compatibility**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that integrates well with existing Flutter applications.

With these features, the `swipe_to_action` package can significantly improve the usability of your Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `swipe_to_action`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `swipe_to_action` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  swipe_to_action: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Basic Setup

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to enable the necessary permissions in your `Info.plist` if your app requires any specific features. However, for basic swipe actions, no additional configuration is typically required.

## Step 3: Using the Package

To use the `swipe_to_action` package, you can wrap your list items with the `SwipeToAction` widget. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:swipe_to_action/swipe_to_action.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Swipe to Action Example')),
        body: ListView.builder(
          itemCount: 10,
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            return SwipeToAction(
              child: ListTile(
                title: Text('Item $index'),
              ),
              onSwipeLeft: () {
                // Action for swipe left
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Swiped left on Item $index')),
                );
              },
              onSwipeRight: () {
                // Action for swipe right
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Swiped right on Item $index')),
                );
              },
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple list of items that can be swiped left or right to trigger different actions. The `SwipeToAction` widget handles the swipe gestures and executes the corresponding callbacks.

# Complete Example of `swipe_to_action`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:swipe_to_action/swipe_to_action.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Swipe to Action Example')),
        body: ListView.builder(
          itemCount: 10, // Number of items in the list
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            return SwipeToAction(
              child: ListTile(
                title: Text('Item $index'), // Display item number
              ),
              onSwipeLeft: () {
                // Action for swipe left
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Swiped left on Item $index')),
                );
              },
              onSwipeRight: () {
                // Action for swipe right
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Swiped right on Item $index')),
                );
              },
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a ListView.
// 3. The ListView.builder creates a list of 10 items.
// 4. Each item is wrapped in a SwipeToAction widget, allowing swipe gestures.
// 5. On swiping left, a SnackBar displays a message indicating the left swipe action.
// 6. On swiping right, a SnackBar displays a message indicating the right swipe action.
// 7. The user can interact with the list items by swiping, triggering the respective actions.
