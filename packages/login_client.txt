**Setting Up the Login Client Package**
=====================================

To use the `login_client` package in your Flutter app, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Pubspec File

Add the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  login_client: ^1.0.0
```
### Step 2: Import the Package

Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:login_client/login_client.dart';
```
### Step 3: Initialize the Package

Initialize the package in your app's `main` function:
```dart
void main() {
  LoginClient.initialize(
    apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
    apiSecret: 'YOUR_API_SECRET',
  );
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```
### Step 4: Create a Login Screen

Create a login screen using the `LoginScreen` widget:
```dart
LoginScreen(
  onLogin: (credentials) {
    // Handle login logic here
  },
)
```
### Platform-Specific Details

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:login_client/login_client.dart';

void main() {
  LoginClient.initialize(
    apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
    apiSecret: 'YOUR_API_SECRET',
  );
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Login Client Demo',
      home: LoginScreen(
        onLogin: (credentials) {
          // Handle login logic here
          print('Login successful!');
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The app starts by initializing the LoginClient package with the API key and secret.
// Then, it runs the RealFlutter app, which displays a login screen using the LoginScreen widget.
// When the user enters their credentials and submits the form, the onLogin callback is called.
// In this example, we simply print a success message to the console.
// In a real-world app, you would handle the login logic here, such as authenticating with a server or storing the user's credentials securely.
