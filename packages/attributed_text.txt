# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Attributed Text Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `attributed_text` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  attributed_text: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:attributed_text/attributed_text.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using Attributed Text

You can now use the `AttributedText` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
AttributedText(
  text: AttributedTextSpan(
    text: 'Hello, ',
    style: TextStyle(color: Colors.black),
    children: [
      AttributedTextSpan(
        text: 'Flutter!',
        style: TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold, color: Colors.blue),
      ),
    ],
  ),
)
```

This will display "Hello, " in black and "Flutter!" in bold blue.

## Conclusion

You are now ready to use the `attributed_text` package in your Flutter applications. With its rich text formatting capabilities, you can create engaging and interactive text displays.

# Complete Example of Using Attributed Text

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:attributed_text/attributed_text.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Attributed Text Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Attributed Text Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: AttributedText(
            text: AttributedTextSpan(
              text: 'Welcome to ',
              style: TextStyle(color: Colors.black),
              children: [
                AttributedTextSpan(
                  text: 'Flutter!',
                  style: TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold, color: Colors.blue),
                ),
                AttributedTextSpan(
                  text: ' Click here for more info.',
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.green),
                  onTap: () {
                    // Action when the text is tapped
                    print('Text tapped!');
                  },
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, we use the AttributedText widget to display styled text.
// 5. The AttributedTextSpan allows us to define different styles for different parts of the text.
// 6. The first part of the text is "Welcome to " in black, followed by "Flutter!" in bold blue.
// 7. The last part is " Click here for more info." in green, which is interactive and prints a message when tapped.
// 8. This demonstrates how to use the attributed_text package to create rich, interactive text in a Flutter application.
