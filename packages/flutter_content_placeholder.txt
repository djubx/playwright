        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Display placeholder text
              PlaceholderText(
                text: 'Loading...',
                fontSize: 24,
                color: Colors.grey,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Display placeholder image
              PlaceholderImage(
                width: 100,
                height: 100,
                shape: BoxShape.circle,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Display custom placeholder content
              Placeholder(
                child: Container(
                  width: 200,
                  height: 200,
                  color: Colors.blue,
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the application and is presented with a screen containing placeholder content.
// 2. The placeholder content is displayed using the PlaceholderText and PlaceholderImage widgets.
// 3. The user can customize the placeholder content by adjusting the font sizes, colors, and shapes.
// 4. The application uses the Placeholder widget to create custom placeholder content.
// 5. The user can interact with the application while the actual data is being loaded.

// The body contains a Column with three children: PlaceholderText, PlaceholderImage, and Placeholder.
// The PlaceholderText and PlaceholderImage widgets display placeholder content.
// The Placeholder widget creates custom placeholder content.
// The application uses the Placeholder widget to create custom placeholder content.
// The user can interact with the application while the actual data is being loaded.
