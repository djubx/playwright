      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user opens the app, and the MyApp widget is rendered.
// 2. The MyApp widget builds the MyHomePage widget.
// 3. The MyHomePage widget creates a THEOplayer instance and configures it with a video source.
// 4. The MyHomePage widget builds the THEOplayerWidget with the THEOplayer instance.
// 5. The THEOplayerWidget renders the video player with the configured video source.
// 6. The user can interact with the video player, such as playing, pausing, and seeking.
// 7. The THEOplayer instance handles the user interactions and updates the video player accordingly.
