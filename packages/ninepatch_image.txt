# NinePatch Image Flutter Package

The `ninepatch_image` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to handle 9-patch images in Flutter applications. 9-patch images are a special type of bitmap image that can be stretched and resized without losing their quality or aspect ratio. This makes them particularly useful for creating scalable UI elements, such as buttons and backgrounds, that need to adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `ninepatch_image` package when:
- You need to create scalable UI components that maintain their visual integrity across various device sizes.
- You want to implement custom backgrounds for buttons, cards, or other widgets that require a specific design.
- You are working with images that need to stretch or shrink while preserving certain areas (like corners) to avoid distortion.

## Features

- **Scalability**: Automatically scales images while preserving the original design.
- **Customizable**: Allows for easy customization of images to fit different UI needs.
- **Performance**: Optimized for performance, ensuring that images load quickly and efficiently.

In summary, the `ninepatch_image` package is an essential tool for Flutter developers looking to create responsive and visually appealing applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the NinePatch Image Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `ninepatch_image` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ninepatch_image: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a 9-patch image in your widget tree:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ninepatch_image/ninepatch_image.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('NinePatch Image Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: NinePatchImage(
          'assets/images/sample.9.png', // Path to your 9-patch image
          width: 200, // Desired width
          height: 100, // Desired height
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we import the `ninepatch_image` package and use the `NinePatchImage` widget to display a 9-patch image. Make sure to replace `'assets/images/sample.9.png'` with the actual path to your 9-patch image.

# Complete Example of NinePatch Image in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ninepatch_image/ninepatch_image.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'NinePatch Image Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('NinePatch Image Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          // Center widget to align the NinePatchImage in the middle of the screen
          child: NinePatchImage(
            'assets/images/sample.9.png', // Path to your 9-patch image
            width: 200, // Set the width of the image
            height: 100, // Set the height of the image
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application, which calls runApp() to start the app.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a title and a home property, which is a Scaffold widget.
// 4. The Scaffold widget provides a structure for the app, including an AppBar and a body.
// 5. The body contains a Center widget that centers its child widget.
// 6. The child of the Center widget is a NinePatchImage, which displays the specified 9-patch image.
// 7. The NinePatchImage widget takes the path to the image and its desired width and height as parameters.
// 8. The app will display the 9-patch image in the center of the screen, scaling it appropriately based on the provided dimensions.
