# Complete Example of Syncfusion Flutter Core

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:syncfusion_flutter_core/core.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // The main MaterialApp widget that serves as the entry point of the application
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Syncfusion Flutter Core Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Scaffold provides a structure for the visual interface
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Syncfusion Flutter Core Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        // Center widget to align the child widget in the center of the screen
        child: Text(
          'Welcome to Syncfusion Flutter Core!',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application, which calls runApp().
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp widget sets up the application with a title and theme.
// 4. The HomePage widget is defined as the home of the MaterialApp.
// 5. Inside HomePage, a Scaffold widget is used to create the basic visual layout.
// 6. The AppBar displays the title of the application.
// 7. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers the text on the screen.
// 8. The application displays a welcome message to the user.
