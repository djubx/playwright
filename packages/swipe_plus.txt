# Tutorial: Setting Up Swipe Plus

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **swipe_plus** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the **swipe_plus** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  swipe_plus: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install Packages

Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file, depending on your app's requirements. However, for basic swipe functionality, no additional configuration is necessary.

## Step 4: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the **swipe_plus** package:

```dart
import 'package:swipe_plus/swipe_plus.dart';
```

## Step 5: Basic Usage

You can now use the **swipe_plus** package in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement swipeable cards.

# Complete Example of Swipe Plus

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:swipe_plus/swipe_plus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Swipe Plus Example',
      home: SwipeExample(),
    );
  }
}

class SwipeExample extends StatelessWidget {
  // Sample data for the cards
  final List<String> items = ["Card 1", "Card 2", "Card 3", "Card 4"];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Swipe Plus Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: SwipePlus(
          // The list of items to swipe through
          items: items.map((item) => buildCard(item)).toList(),
          // Callback for when a card is swiped left
          onSwipeLeft: (item) {
            print('$item swiped left');
          },
          // Callback for when a card is swiped right
          onSwipeRight: (item) {
            print('$item swiped right');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to build a card widget
  Widget buildCard(String item) {
    return Card(
      elevation: 4,
      child: Container(
        width: 300,
        height: 200,
        alignment: Alignment.center,
        child: Text(
          item,
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets MyApp as the root widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget (SwipeExample).
// 3. SwipeExample contains a list of items to be displayed as swipeable cards.
// 4. The SwipePlus widget is used to create the swipeable interface, taking the list of cards and defining callbacks for swipe actions.
// 5. Each card is built using the buildCard function, which creates a Card widget with a text label.
// 6. When a card is swiped left or right, the corresponding callback is triggered, printing the action to the console.
