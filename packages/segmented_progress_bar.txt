# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Segmented Progress Bar

## Installation
To use the `segmented_progress_bar` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  segmented_progress_bar: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Then, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `segmented_progress_bar`, you can simply import the package and create an instance of the `SegmentedProgressBar` widget in your Flutter application.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:segmented_progress_bar/segmented_progress_bar.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Segmented Progress Bar Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: SegmentedProgressBar(
          segments: [
            Segment(color: Colors.red, progress: 0.3),
            Segment(color: Colors.yellow, progress: 0.5),
            Segment(color: Colors.green, progress: 0.2),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code creates a simple segmented progress bar with three segments, each having different colors and progress values.

# Complete Example of Segmented Progress Bar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:segmented_progress_bar/segmented_progress_bar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Segmented Progress Bar Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Segmented Progress Bar Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: SegmentedProgressBar(
            // Define the segments of the progress bar
            segments: [
              // First segment with 30% progress
              Segment(color: Colors.red, progress: 0.3),
              // Second segment with 50% progress
              Segment(color: Colors.yellow, progress: 0.5),
              // Third segment with 20% progress
              Segment(color: Colors.green, progress: 0.2),
            ],
            // Optional: Set the height of the progress bar
            height: 20.0,
            // Optional: Set the border radius for rounded corners
            borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(10.0),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to a Scaffold widget.
// 4. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with a title and a Center widget in the body.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a SegmentedProgressBar is created with three segments.
// 6. Each segment is defined with a color and a progress value, representing the completion percentage.
// 7. The height and border radius of the progress bar can be customized for better aesthetics.
