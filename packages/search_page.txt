# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the "search_page" Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the `search_page` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  search_page: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a search page using the `search_page` package.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:search_page/search_page.dart';
```

2. Create a list of items to search through. This can be a list of strings, objects, or any data type you prefer.

3. Use the `SearchPage` widget to create a search interface.

Hereâ€™s a basic implementation:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:search_page/search_page.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Search Page Example'),
          actions: [
            IconButton(
              icon: Icon(Icons.search),
              onPressed: () {
                showSearchPage(context);
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
        body: Center(child: Text('Press the search icon to start searching!')),
      ),
    );
  }

  void showSearchPage(BuildContext context) {
    showSearch(
      context: context,
      delegate: SearchPage(
        items: ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry', 'Date', 'Elderberry'],
        searchLabel: 'Search Fruits',
        suggestion: Center(
          child: Text('Filter fruits by name'),
        ),
        failure: Center(
          child: Text('No fruit found!'),
        ),
        filter: (fruit) => [
          fruit,
          fruit.toLowerCase(),
        ],
        builder: (fruit) => ListTile(
          title: Text(fruit),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app with a search icon in the app bar. When the icon is pressed, the search page is displayed, allowing users to search through a list of fruits.

# Complete Example of Using the "search_page" Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:search_page/search_page.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Search Page Example'),
          actions: [
            // Adding a search icon to the app bar
            IconButton(
              icon: Icon(Icons.search),
              onPressed: () {
                // Show the search page when the icon is pressed
                showSearchPage(context);
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
        body: Center(
          // Display a message when no search is active
          child: Text('Press the search icon to start searching!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void showSearchPage(BuildContext context) {
    // Show the search page with a list of items
    showSearch(
      context: context,
      delegate: SearchPage(
        items: ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry', 'Date', 'Elderberry'], // List of items to search
        searchLabel: 'Search Fruits', // Label for the search bar
        suggestion: Center(
          child: Text('Filter fruits by name'), // Suggestion text when no search is performed
        ),
        failure: Center(
          child: Text('No fruit found!'), // Message displayed when no results match the search
        ),
        filter: (fruit) => [
          fruit, // Filter by the fruit name
          fruit.toLowerCase(), // Also filter by the lowercase version of the name
        ],
        builder: (fruit) => ListTile(
          title: Text(fruit), // Display each fruit in a list tile
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which builds the main MaterialApp.
// 2. The AppBar contains a search icon that, when pressed, triggers the showSearchPage method.
// 3. The showSearchPage method displays the SearchPage widget, which takes a list of fruits as items.
// 4. Users can type in the search bar to filter the list of fruits.
// 5. Suggestions and failure messages are displayed based on the search results.
// 6. Each matching fruit is displayed in a ListTile format, allowing for easy selection.
