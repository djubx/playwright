# Complete Example of Using flutter_no_internet_widget

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_no_internet_widget/flutter_no_internet_widget.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'No Internet Widget Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('No Internet Example'),
        ),
        body: NoInternetWidget(
          // This widget will be displayed when there is no internet connection
          child: Center(
            child: Text(
              'You are connected to the internet!',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
          ),
          // Customize the no internet widget
          noInternetWidget: Center(
            child: Column(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              children: [
                Icon(Icons.signal_wifi_off, size: 50, color: Colors.red),
                SizedBox(height: 20),
                Text(
                  'No Internet Connection',
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.red),
                ),
                SizedBox(height: 10),
                Text(
                  'Please check your connection.',
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'No Internet Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains the NoInternetWidget.
// 5. If there is an internet connection, the child widget (a centered text) is displayed.
// 6. If there is no internet connection, the noInternetWidget is displayed, which includes an icon and messages informing the user about the lack of connectivity.
// 7. The app automatically listens for connectivity changes and updates the UI accordingly.
