<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_file_uploader/flutter_file_uploader.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'File Uploader Example',
      home: FileUploaderScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class FileUploaderScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _FileUploaderScreenState createState() => _FileUploaderScreenState();
}

class _FileUploaderScreenState extends State<FileUploaderScreen> {
  // Variable to hold the upload progress
  double _progress = 0.0;

  // Function to upload a file
  void _uploadFile() async {
    // Specify the file path and the server URL
    String filePath = 'path/to/your/file.jpg'; // Replace with your file path
    String serverUrl = 'https://yourserver.com/upload'; // Replace with your server URL

    // Create an instance of the uploader
    FlutterFileUploader uploader = FlutterFileUploader();

    // Start the upload process
    uploader.uploadFile(filePath, serverUrl).listen((event) {
      // Update the progress based on the event
      setState(() {
        _progress = event.progress; // Update progress
      });

      // Check for errors
      if (event.error != null) {
        // Handle error
        print('Error: ${event.error}');
      }

      // Check for completion
      if (event.isCompleted) {
        // Handle completion
        print('Upload completed: ${event.response}');
      }
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('File Uploader'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Upload Progress: ${(_progress * 100).toStringAsFixed(2)}%'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _uploadFile,
              child: Text('Upload File'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The FileUploaderScreen widget is created, which manages the file upload process.
// 4. The _uploadFile function is called when the user presses the "Upload File" button.
// 5. The file path and server URL are specified, and the upload process is initiated.
// 6. The upload progress is tracked and displayed on the screen.
// 7. Any errors during the upload are printed to the console, and upon completion, the response is also printed.
```
