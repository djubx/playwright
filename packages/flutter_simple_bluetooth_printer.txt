   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
   ```

2. **Bluetooth Settings**: Ensure that Bluetooth is enabled on the device.

#### iOS Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file located in `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

   ```xml
   <key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
   <string>This app requires Bluetooth access to connect to printers.</string>
   <key>NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription</key>
   <string>This app requires Bluetooth access to connect to printers.</string>
   ```

2. **Bluetooth Settings**: Ensure that Bluetooth is enabled on the device.

### Step 3: Import the Package

# Complete Example

Here’s a complete example of a Flutter application that demonstrates the key features of the `flutter_simple_bluetooth_printer` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_simple_bluetooth_printer/flutter_simple_bluetooth_printer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Create an instance of the BluetoothPrinter
  final FlutterSimpleBluetoothPrinter printer = FlutterSimpleBluetoothPrinter();
  List<BluetoothDevice> devices = []; // List to hold discovered Bluetooth devices
  BluetoothDevice? selectedDevice; // Currently selected Bluetooth device

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Discover Bluetooth devices when the app starts
    discoverDevices();
  }

  // Function to discover Bluetooth devices
  void discoverDevices() async {
    devices = await printer.getBondedDevices(); // Get paired devices
    setState(() {}); // Update the UI
  }

  // Function to print a sample receipt
  void printReceipt() async {
    if (selectedDevice != null) {
      await printer.connect(selectedDevice!); // Connect to the selected device
      await printer.printCustom("Hello, World!", 2, 1); // Print text
      await printer.printNewLine(); // Add a new line
      await printer.printCustom("Thank you for your purchase!", 1, 0); // Print another line
      await printer.disconnect(); // Disconnect after printing
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Bluetooth Printer Example')),
        body: Column(
          children: [
            // Dropdown to select a Bluetooth device
            DropdownButton<BluetoothDevice>(
              hint: Text("Select a Bluetooth Device"),
              value: selectedDevice,
              onChanged: (BluetoothDevice? device) {
                setState(() {
                  selectedDevice = device; // Update selected device
                });
              },
              items: devices.map((BluetoothDevice device) {
                return DropdownMenuItem<BluetoothDevice>(
                  value: device,
                  child: Text(device.name ?? "Unknown Device"),
                );
              }).toList(),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: printReceipt, // Print receipt on button press
              child: Text("Print Receipt"),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and initializes the Bluetooth printer instance.
// 2. It discovers paired Bluetooth devices and populates the dropdown menu.
// 3. The user selects a Bluetooth device from the dropdown.
// 4. When the "Print Receipt" button is pressed, the app connects to the selected device.
// 5. It sends print commands to print a custom message and a thank you note.
// 6. Finally, it disconnects from the printer after printing.
```
