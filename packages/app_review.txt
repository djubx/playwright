# Setup and Usage
To use the `app_review` package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Pubspec File
Add the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  app_review: ^1.0.0
```
Then, run `flutter pub get` to get the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package
Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:app_review/app_review.dart';
```
### Step 3: Request a Review
Use the `requestReview` method to request a review:
```dart
AppReview.requestReview();
```
You can also pass a callback to handle the result of the review request:
```dart
AppReview.requestReview().then((result) {
  if (result) {
    print('Review request successful');
  } else {
    print('Review request failed');
  }
});
```
### Platform-Specific Details
For iOS, you need to add the following code to your `Info.plist` file:
```xml
<key>NSAppReview</key>
<true/>
```
For Android, you need to add the following code to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:
```xml
<application>
  ...
  <meta-data android:name="com.google.android.gms.version" android:value="@integer/google_play_services_version" />
</application>
```
### Optimizations
You can optimize the review request by checking if the user has already left a review:
```dart
AppReview.hasLeftReview().then((hasLeftReview) {
  if (!hasLeftReview) {
    AppReview.requestReview();
  }
});
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:app_review/app_review.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'App Review Demo',
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('App Review Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Request a review
            AppReview.requestReview().then((result) {
              if (result) {
                print('Review request successful');
              } else {
                print('Review request failed');
              }
            });
          },
          child: Text('Leave a Review'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application flow:
// 1. The user opens the app and is presented with a button to leave a review.
// 2. When the user clicks the button, the app requests a review using the `AppReview.requestReview()` method.
// 3. The user is then presented with a dialog to leave a review.
// 4. If the user leaves a review, the app prints a success message to the console.
// 5. If the user cancels the review request, the app prints a failure message to the console.

// Summary:
// This code demonstrates how to use the `app_review` package to request a review from the user.
// The app presents a button to leave a review, and when clicked, it requests a review using the `AppReview.requestReview()` method.
// The app then handles the result of the review request and prints a success or failure message to the console.
