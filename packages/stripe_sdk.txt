# Tutorial: Setting Up the Stripe SDK in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `stripe_sdk` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `stripe_sdk` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  stripe_sdk: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Configure for Android

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version required
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

## Step 3: Configure for iOS

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. Ensure you have the correct deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Initialize Stripe

In your main Dart file, initialize Stripe with your publishable key:

```dart
import 'package:stripe_sdk/stripe_sdk.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  Stripe.init('your_publishable_key'); // Replace with your actual publishable key
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 5: Create Payment Method

You can now create a payment method using the `Stripe` class. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to collect card details and process a payment.

# Complete Example: Stripe Payment Integration

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:stripe_sdk/stripe_sdk.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  Stripe.init('your_publishable_key'); // Initialize Stripe with your publishable key
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the main application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Stripe SDK Example',
      home: PaymentScreen(), // Set the home screen to PaymentScreen
    );
  }
}

class PaymentScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PaymentScreenState createState() => _PaymentScreenState();
}

class _PaymentScreenState extends State<PaymentScreen> {
  final _cardController = TextEditingController(); // Controller for card input
  String _paymentStatus = ''; // Variable to hold payment status

  // Function to handle payment processing
  void _processPayment() async {
    // Create a payment method using the card details
    final paymentMethod = await Stripe.paymentMethods.create(
      PaymentMethodRequest(
        card: Card(
          number: _cardController.text, // Get card number from input
          expMonth: 12, // Example expiration month
          expYear: 23, // Example expiration year
          cvc: '123', // Example CVC
        ),
      ),
    );

    // Check if payment method was created successfully
    if (paymentMethod != null) {
      setState(() {
        _paymentStatus = 'Payment Method Created: ${paymentMethod.id}'; // Update payment status
      });
    } else {
      setState(() {
        _paymentStatus = 'Payment Failed'; // Update payment status on failure
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Stripe Payment Example')), // App bar title
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              controller: _cardController, // Card input field
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Card Number'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _processPayment, // Trigger payment processing
              child: Text('Pay Now'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(_paymentStatus), // Display payment status
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application that integrates the Stripe SDK for payment processing. 
// Here's a step-by-step explanation of the application flow:

// 1. **Initialization**: The application starts by initializing the Stripe SDK with a publishable key.
// 2. **User Interface**: The `PaymentScreen` widget is displayed, which contains a text field for the user to enter their card number and a button to initiate the payment.
// 3. **Payment Processing**: When the user clicks the "Pay Now" button, the `_processPayment` function is called. This function creates a payment method using the card details entered by the user.
// 4. **Payment Status**: After attempting to create the payment method, the application updates the `_paymentStatus` variable to reflect whether the payment was successful or failed, which is then displayed on the screen.

// This simple example illustrates how to set up and use the `stripe_sdk` package in a Flutter application, allowing for easy payment processing.
