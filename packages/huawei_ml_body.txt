# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Huawei ML Body Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **huawei_ml_body** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  huawei_ml_body: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/huawei_ml_body).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update Android Manifest**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
   ```

2. **Add Huawei Services**: Ensure that you have the Huawei services configured in your project. This includes adding the necessary dependencies in your `build.gradle` files.

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request camera access:

   ```xml
   <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your camera for body analysis.</string>
   ```

2. **CocoaPods**: Ensure that your iOS project is using CocoaPods for dependency management. Run `pod install` in the `ios` directory.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement body analysis using the **huawei_ml_body** package.

# Complete Example: Using Huawei ML Body in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:huawei_ml_body/huawei_ml_body.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Huawei ML Body Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: BodyAnalysisScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class BodyAnalysisScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _BodyAnalysisScreenState createState() => _BodyAnalysisScreenState();
}

class _BodyAnalysisScreenState extends State<BodyAnalysisScreen> {
  String _result = "No data yet";

  // Function to analyze body from an image
  Future<void> _analyzeBody() async {
    // Check if the camera is available
    final isCameraAvailable = await MLBody.isCameraAvailable();
    if (!isCameraAvailable) {
      setState(() {
        _result = "Camera not available";
      });
      return;
    }

    // Start the body analysis
    try {
      final result = await MLBody.analyzeBody();
      setState(() {
        _result = result.toString(); // Display the analysis result
      });
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        _result = "Error: $e"; // Handle any errors
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Body Analysis'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Analysis Result:',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(
              _result,
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _analyzeBody,
              child: Text('Analyze Body'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home screen is BodyAnalysisScreen, which contains the UI for body analysis.
// 4. When the user presses the "Analyze Body" button, the _analyzeBody function is called.
// 5. The function checks if the camera is available and then calls the analyzeBody method from the huawei_ml_body package.
// 6. The result of the analysis is displayed on the screen, or an error message is shown if something goes wrong.
```
