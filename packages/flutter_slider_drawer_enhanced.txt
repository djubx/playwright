# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_slider_drawer_enhanced

## Installation
To get started with `flutter_slider_drawer_enhanced`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_slider_drawer_enhanced: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_slider_drawer_enhanced).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` to allow for certain permissions if your drawer interacts with device features.

## Basic Usage
To use the `flutter_slider_drawer_enhanced` package, you need to wrap your main widget with the `SliderDrawer` widget. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_slider_drawer_enhanced/flutter_slider_drawer_enhanced.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: SliderDrawer(
        drawer: DrawerWidget(), // Your custom drawer widget
        child: MainContent(), // Your main content widget
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, `DrawerWidget` is where you define the content of your sliding drawer, and `MainContent` is your main application interface.

# Complete Example of flutter_slider_drawer_enhanced

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_slider_drawer_enhanced/flutter_slider_drawer_enhanced.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: SliderDrawer(
        drawer: DrawerWidget(), // Custom drawer widget
        child: MainContent(), // Main content of the app
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Custom drawer widget
class DrawerWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      width: 250, // Width of the drawer
      color: Colors.blue, // Background color of the drawer
      child: Column(
        children: [
          ListTile(
            title: Text('Item 1', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white)),
            onTap: () {
              // Handle item tap
            },
          ),
          ListTile(
            title: Text('Item 2', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white)),
            onTap: () {
              // Handle item tap
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Main content widget
class MainContent extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Slider Drawer Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Open the drawer when the button is pressed
            SliderDrawer.of(context)?.open();
          },
          child: Text('Open Drawer'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The SliderDrawer widget wraps the main content and the drawer widget.
// 3. The DrawerWidget contains a list of items that can be tapped.
// 4. The MainContent widget has a button that, when pressed, opens the drawer.
// 5. The drawer can be customized further with additional items and styles.
```
<!-- END_MAIN -->
```

### Summary of Application Flow
The application begins with the `RealFlutter` class, which initializes the `MaterialApp`. The `SliderDrawer` widget is used to combine the main content and the drawer. The `DrawerWidget` defines the content of the drawer, while the `MainContent` widget contains a button that opens the drawer when pressed. This structure allows for a clean separation of the UI components and provides a smooth user experience with the sliding drawer functionality.
