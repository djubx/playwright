// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user clicks the "Load Data" button, which triggers the `_loadData` function.
// 2. The `_loadData` function calls the `loadData` method of the Alfreed instance.
// 3. The Alfreed instance checks if the data is cached locally. If it is, it returns the cached data.
// 4. If the data is not cached locally, the Alfreed instance calls the `loadData` method of the data source.
// 5. The data source simulates data loading by delaying for 2 seconds.
// 6. The data source returns the loaded data, which is then cached locally by the Alfreed instance.
// 7. The Alfreed instance returns the loaded data to the `_loadData` function.
// 8. The `_loadData` function prints the loaded data to the console.

// In summary, the Alfreed package provides a simple and efficient way to manage asynchronous data loading and caching.
// It allows developers to easily handle data loading, caching, and error handling, making it an ideal solution for apps that require complex data management.
