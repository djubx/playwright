# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using ir_datetime_picker

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `ir_datetime_picker` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ir_datetime_picker: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `ir_datetime_picker` in your app.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:ir_datetime_picker/ir_datetime_picker.dart';
```

2. Create a simple UI to display the date and time picker:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ir_datetime_picker/ir_datetime_picker.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('DateTime Picker Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Show the date and time picker
              showDateTimePicker(context);
            },
            child: Text('Pick Date and Time'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void showDateTimePicker(BuildContext context) {
    // Show the date and time picker dialog
    showDialog(
      context: context,
      builder: (BuildContext context) {
        return DateTimePickerDialog(
          initialDate: DateTime.now(),
          onDateTimeChanged: (dateTime) {
            // Handle the selected date and time
            print('Selected date and time: $dateTime');
          },
        );
      },
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the user taps the "Pick Date and Time" button, a dialog will appear allowing them to select a date and time.

# Complete Example of ir_datetime_picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ir_datetime_picker/ir_datetime_picker.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('DateTime Picker Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Show the date and time picker when the button is pressed
              showDateTimePicker(context);
            },
            child: Text('Pick Date and Time'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void showDateTimePicker(BuildContext context) {
    // Show the date and time picker dialog
    showDialog(
      context: context,
      builder: (BuildContext context) {
        return DateTimePickerDialog(
          initialDate: DateTime.now(), // Set the initial date to now
          onDateTimeChanged: (dateTime) {
            // Handle the selected date and time
            print('Selected date and time: $dateTime');
          },
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which builds a MaterialApp.
// 2. The home of the app is a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, there is an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the showDateTimePicker method is called.
// 5. This method displays a DateTimePickerDialog, initialized to the current date and time.
// 6. When the user selects a date and time, the onDateTimeChanged callback is triggered, printing the selected date and time to the console.
```
