# Overview of the battery_info Flutter Package

The `battery_info` Flutter package is a powerful tool that allows developers to access battery-related information on both Android and iOS devices. This package provides a simple and efficient way to retrieve details such as battery level, charging status, and health, making it an essential addition for applications that require power management or battery status monitoring.

## When to Use

You might consider using the `battery_info` package in scenarios such as:
- **Power Management Applications**: Apps that help users manage their device's battery life.
- **Device Health Monitoring**: Applications that provide insights into the health and status of the device's battery.
- **User Notifications**: Apps that need to notify users about battery status changes, such as low battery warnings.

## Features

- **Battery Level**: Retrieve the current battery level as a percentage.
- **Charging Status**: Check if the device is charging, fully charged, or discharging.
- **Battery Health**: Get information about the battery's health status.
- **Platform Compatibility**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

With these features, the `battery_info` package is a versatile tool for any Flutter developer looking to enhance their application's functionality related to battery management.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the battery_info Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `battery_info` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  battery_info: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions to access battery information. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permission:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BATTERY_STATS"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to ensure that your app has the appropriate permissions set in the `Info.plist` file. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSBatteryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to battery information.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to retrieve and display battery information.

```dart
import 'package:battery_info/battery_info.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String batteryLevel = 'Unknown';
  String chargingStatus = 'Unknown';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _getBatteryInfo();
  }

  Future<void> _getBatteryInfo() async {
    // Get battery level
    final battery = BatteryInfo();
    final batteryData = await battery.batteryLevel;
    setState(() {
      batteryLevel = batteryData.toString();
    });

    // Get charging status
    final chargingData = await battery.chargingStatus;
    setState(() {
      chargingStatus = chargingData.toString();
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Battery Info Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Battery Level: $batteryLevel%'),
            Text('Charging Status: $chargingStatus'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that displays the battery level and charging status. The `_getBatteryInfo` method retrieves the battery information asynchronously and updates the UI accordingly.

# Complete Example of the battery_info Package

```dart
import 'package:battery_info/battery_info.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String batteryLevel = 'Unknown'; // Variable to hold battery level
  String chargingStatus = 'Unknown'; // Variable to hold charging status

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _getBatteryInfo(); // Call method to get battery info on initialization
  }

  Future<void> _getBatteryInfo() async {
    // Create an instance of BatteryInfo
    final battery = BatteryInfo();

    // Get battery level
    final batteryData = await battery.batteryLevel; // Asynchronously fetch battery level
    setState(() {
      batteryLevel = batteryData.toString(); // Update battery level state
    });

    // Get charging status
    final chargingData = await battery.chargingStatus; // Asynchronously fetch charging status
    setState(() {
      chargingStatus = chargingData.toString(); // Update charging status state
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Battery Info Example'), // App title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Battery Level: $batteryLevel%'), // Display battery level
            Text('Charging Status: $chargingStatus'), // Display charging status
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatefulWidget that manages its state.
// 3. In the initState method, the _getBatteryInfo method is called to fetch battery information.
// 4. The _getBatteryInfo method retrieves the battery level and charging status asynchronously.
// 5. The retrieved values are stored in the state variables batteryLevel and chargingStatus.
// 6. The build method constructs the UI, displaying the battery level and charging status in the center of the screen.
