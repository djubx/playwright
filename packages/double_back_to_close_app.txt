# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `double_back_to_close_app`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `double_back_to_close_app` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  double_back_to_close_app: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:double_back_to_close_app/double_back_to_close_app.dart';
```

## Step 3: Wrapping Your Widget

You need to wrap your main widget with `DoubleBackToCloseApp`. Here’s how to do it:

### For Android

1. Ensure your `AndroidManifest.xml` has the necessary permissions (usually not required for this package).
2. The package works out of the box without additional configurations.

### For iOS

1. Open your `Info.plist` file and ensure you have the necessary configurations (usually not required for this package).
2. The package is compatible with iOS without any special settings.

## Step 4: Using the Package

Here’s a simple example of how to implement the `DoubleBackToCloseApp` widget:

```dart
DoubleBackToCloseApp(
  child: YourMainWidget(), // Replace with your main widget
  snackBar: const SnackBar(
    content: Text('Press back again to exit'),
  ),
);
```

This setup will show a Snackbar message prompting the user to double-tap the back button to exit the app.

## Conclusion

With these steps, you can easily integrate the `double_back_to_close_app` package into your Flutter application, enhancing user experience by preventing accidental exits.

# Complete Example of Using `double_back_to_close_app`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:double_back_to_close_app/double_back_to_close_app.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Double Back to Close App Example',
      home: DoubleBackToCloseApp(
        child: HomeScreen(),
        snackBar: const SnackBar(
          content: Text('Press back again to exit'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Welcome to the Double Back to Close App Example!',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home property.
// 3. The home property is wrapped in DoubleBackToCloseApp, which takes a child widget (HomeScreen) and a SnackBar message.
// 4. The HomeScreen widget displays a simple Scaffold with an AppBar and a centered Text widget.
// 5. When the user presses the back button, the SnackBar prompts them to press back again to exit the app.
// 6. If the user presses back a second time, the app will close, preventing accidental exits.
