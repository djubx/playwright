# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using new_keyboard_shortcuts

## Installation
To get started with the `new_keyboard_shortcuts` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  new_keyboard_shortcuts: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/new_keyboard_shortcuts).

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your app has the necessary permissions to listen for keyboard events. This is typically handled by default, but you may want to test your app on various devices to ensure compatibility.

### iOS
On iOS, keyboard shortcuts are generally supported out of the box. However, ensure that your app's UI is designed to accommodate keyboard interactions, especially for iPad users.

## Basic Usage
To use the `new_keyboard_shortcuts` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:new_keyboard_shortcuts/new_keyboard_shortcuts.dart';
```

You can then define your keyboard shortcuts within your widget tree. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
KeyboardShortcuts(
  shortcuts: {
    LogicalKeyboardKey.control: () {
      // Action for Ctrl key
    },
    LogicalKeyboardKey.keyS: () {
      // Action for Ctrl + S
    },
  },
  child: YourWidget(),
);
```

This setup allows you to define actions that will be triggered when specific keys are pressed.

# Complete Example of new_keyboard_shortcuts

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:new_keyboard_shortcuts/new_keyboard_shortcuts.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Keyboard Shortcuts Example',
      home: KeyboardShortcuts(
        shortcuts: {
          LogicalKeyboardKey.control: () {
            // Action for Ctrl key
            print('Control key pressed');
          },
          LogicalKeyboardKey.keyS: () {
            // Action for Ctrl + S
            print('Save action triggered');
          },
        },
        child: Scaffold(
          appBar: AppBar(
            title: Text('Keyboard Shortcuts Demo'),
          ),
          body: Center(
            child: Text('Press Ctrl + S to save.'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home property.
// 3. Inside the home property, we wrap our Scaffold with the KeyboardShortcuts widget.
// 4. We define two keyboard shortcuts: one for the Control key and another for Ctrl + S.
// 5. When the Control key is pressed, a message is printed to the console.
// 6. When Ctrl + S is pressed, a different message indicating a save action is printed.
// 7. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget displaying a simple text instruction.
