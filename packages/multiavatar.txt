# Tutorial: Setting Up Multiavatar in Flutter

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the Multiavatar package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  multiavatar: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install Packages

Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to enable the use of Swift in your project. Open your `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode and ensure that the project settings are configured to support Swift.

## Step 4: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the Multiavatar package:

```dart
import 'package:multiavatar/multiavatar.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using Multiavatar

You can now use the Multiavatar package to generate avatars. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create an avatar based on a username:

```dart
String avatar = multiavatar('username');
```

This will generate an SVG string that you can display in your Flutter application using the `SvgPicture` widget from the `flutter_svg` package.

## Step 6: Displaying the Avatar

To display the generated avatar, you can use the following code snippet:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_svg/flutter_svg.dart';
import 'package:multiavatar/multiavatar.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    String avatar = multiavatar('username');

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Multiavatar Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: SvgPicture.string(
          avatar,
          width: 100,
          height: 100,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code will create a simple Flutter application that displays an avatar based on the username provided.

# Complete Example of Multiavatar in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart'; // Importing Flutter material package for UI components
import 'package:flutter_svg/flutter_svg.dart'; // Importing flutter_svg to display SVG images
import 'package:multiavatar/multiavatar.dart'; // Importing Multiavatar package for avatar generation

// Main entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp()); // Running the MyApp widget
}

// MyApp widget that serves as the root of the application
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Multiavatar Demo', // Title of the application
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue, // Setting the primary color theme
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(), // Setting the home widget to RealFlutter
    );
  }
}

// RealFlutter widget that displays the avatar
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Generating an avatar based on the username 'username'
    String avatar = multiavatar('username');

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Multiavatar Example')), // AppBar with title
      body: Center(
        child: SvgPicture.string(
          avatar, // Displaying the generated SVG avatar
          width: 100, // Setting width of the avatar
          height: 100, // Setting height of the avatar
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme, and specifies RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. In the RealFlutter widget, an avatar is generated using the multiavatar function with 'username' as input.
// 4. The generated SVG string is displayed in the center of the screen using the SvgPicture.string widget.
// 5. The application showcases a simple avatar generation based on the provided username.
