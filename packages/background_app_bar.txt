# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Background App Bar Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **background_app_bar** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **background_app_bar** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  background_app_bar: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    compileSdkVersion 31  // or the latest version
    ...
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to set the minimum deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '12.0'  # or the latest version
```

## Step 3: Using the Background App Bar

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to implement it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to use the **background_app_bar** package.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:background_app_bar/background_app_bar.dart';
```

2. Create a widget that uses the `BackgroundAppBar`:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: CustomScrollView(
        slivers: [
          SliverBackgroundAppBar(
            background: Image.network('https://example.com/background.jpg', fit: BoxFit.cover),
            title: Text('My App'),
            expandedHeight: 200.0,
            floating: true,
            pinned: true,
          ),
          // Add your other slivers here
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a `CustomScrollView` with a `SliverBackgroundAppBar` that uses an image as its background. The app bar is set to be floating and pinned, allowing it to remain visible while scrolling.

## Conclusion

You have now successfully set up and used the **background_app_bar** package in your Flutter application. This package allows for a more dynamic and visually appealing app bar, enhancing the overall user experience.

# Complete Example of Using Background App Bar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:background_app_bar/background_app_bar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Background App Bar Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        body: CustomScrollView(
          slivers: [
            // Creating a SliverBackgroundAppBar with a background image
            SliverBackgroundAppBar(
              background: Image.network(
                'https://example.com/background.jpg', // Background image URL
                fit: BoxFit.cover, // Ensures the image covers the app bar
              ),
              title: Text('My App'), // Title of the app bar
              expandedHeight: 200.0, // Height of the expanded app bar
              floating: true, // Allows the app bar to float
              pinned: true, // Keeps the app bar visible when scrolling
            ),
            // Adding a SliverList to display content
            SliverList(
              delegate: SliverChildBuilderDelegate(
                (BuildContext context, int index) {
                  return ListTile(
                    title: Text('Item #$index'), // Displaying list items
                  );
                },
                childCount: 50, // Number of items in the list
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home.
// 3. The home widget is a Scaffold containing a CustomScrollView.
// 4. Inside the CustomScrollView, we have a SliverBackgroundAppBar that displays a background image and a title.
// 5. The app bar is configured to be floating and pinned, allowing it to remain visible during scrolling.
// 6. Below the app bar, we have a SliverList that generates a list of items, demonstrating how to add content below the app bar.
