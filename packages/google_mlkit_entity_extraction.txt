<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Google ML Kit Entity Extraction Flutter Package

The `google_mlkit_entity_extraction` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to integrate machine learning capabilities into their applications. This package leverages Google's ML Kit to extract entities from text, making it particularly useful for applications that require natural language processing (NLP) capabilities. 

## When to Use This Package
You might consider using the `google_mlkit_entity_extraction` package in scenarios such as:
- **Chatbots**: To understand user inputs and extract relevant entities like names, dates, and locations.
- **Data Entry Applications**: To automatically identify and categorize information from user input.
- **Content Analysis**: To analyze and extract key information from large bodies of text.

## Features
- **Real-time Entity Extraction**: Extracts entities from text input in real-time.
- **Support for Multiple Languages**: Works with various languages, making it versatile for global applications.
- **Customizable**: Allows developers to fine-tune the extraction process based on specific needs.

This package is an essential tool for developers looking to enhance user interaction through intelligent text processing.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Google ML Kit Entity Extraction Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the `google_mlkit_entity_extraction` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  google_mlkit_entity_extraction: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/google_mlkit_entity_extraction).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version required
    }
}
```

2. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the camera for entity extraction.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the microphone for entity extraction.</string>
```

2. Ensure your iOS deployment target is set to at least 11.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '11.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement entity extraction.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:google_mlkit_entity_extraction/google_mlkit_entity_extraction.dart';
```

2. Initialize the entity extractor and process text:

```dart
final entityExtractor = EntityExtractor();
final inputText = "John Doe visited New York on January 1st, 2023.";
final entities = await entityExtractor.extractEntities(inputText);
```

3. Handle the extracted entities:

```dart
for (var entity in entities) {
  print('Entity: ${entity.text}, Type: ${entity.type}');
}
```

This setup allows you to extract entities from any given text input, making it a powerful addition to your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example: Flutter Application Using Google ML Kit Entity Extraction

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:google_mlkit_entity_extraction/google_mlkit_entity_extraction.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Entity Extraction Example',
      home: EntityExtractionScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class EntityExtractionScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _EntityExtractionScreenState createState() => _EntityExtractionScreenState();
}

class _EntityExtractionScreenState extends State<EntityExtractionScreen> {
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController();
  final EntityExtractor _entityExtractor = EntityExtractor();
  List<Entity> _extractedEntities = [];

  // Function to extract entities from the input text
  void _extractEntities() async {
    final inputText = _controller.text;
    final entities = await _entityExtractor.extractEntities(inputText);
    setState(() {
      _extractedEntities = entities; // Update the state with extracted entities
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Entity Extraction'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              controller: _controller,
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Enter text',
                suffixIcon: IconButton(
                  icon: Icon(Icons.search),
                  onPressed: _extractEntities, // Trigger entity extraction
                ),
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Expanded(
              child: ListView.builder(
                itemCount: _extractedEntities.length,
                itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                  final entity = _extractedEntities[index];
                  return ListTile(
                    title: Text(entity.text), // Display extracted entity text
                    subtitle: Text('Type: ${entity.type}'), // Display entity type
                  );
                },
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The EntityExtractionScreen widget is created, which contains a TextField for user input.
// 4. When the user enters text and presses the search icon, the _extractEntities function is called.
// 5. This function uses the EntityExtractor to extract entities from the input text.
// 6. The extracted entities are stored in the _extractedEntities list and displayed in a ListView.
// 7. Each entity is shown with its text and type, providing a clear view of the extracted information.
