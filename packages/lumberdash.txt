# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Lumberdash

## Step 1: Adding Dependency

To get started with Lumberdash, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  lumberdash: ^1.0.0
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Basic Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you plan to log sensitive information. However, basic logging does not require any special permissions.

## Step 3: Using Lumberdash

Now that you have set up Lumberdash, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Here’s how to initialize and log messages:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:lumberdash/lumberdash.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize Lumberdash
  Lumberdash.init();

  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Lumberdash Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Lumberdash Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Log an info message
              Lumberdash.log('Button pressed!');
            },
            child: Text('Press Me'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize Lumberdash in the `main` function and log a message when the button is pressed.

## Step 4: Customizing Log Levels

You can customize log levels by defining them in your application. Here’s an example of how to create a custom log level:

```dart
Lumberdash.setLogLevel(LogLevel.debug);
```

This will ensure that only debug messages and above are logged.

## Conclusion

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use Lumberdash in your Flutter application effectively. The package provides a robust logging solution that can greatly enhance your development and debugging processes.

# Complete Example of Lumberdash in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:lumberdash/lumberdash.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize Lumberdash for logging
  Lumberdash.init();

  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Lumberdash Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Lumberdash Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Log an info message when the button is pressed
                  Lumberdash.log('Button pressed!');
                },
                child: Text('Press Me'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Log an error message
                  try {
                    throw Exception('This is a test exception');
                  } catch (e) {
                    Lumberdash.log('Error occurred: $e', level: LogLevel.error);
                  }
                },
                child: Text('Cause Error'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes Lumberdash for logging.
// 2. The MyApp widget is created, which builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The app contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, there are two ElevatedButtons.
// 5. The first button logs an info message when pressed.
// 6. The second button simulates an error and logs an error message when pressed.
// 7. The logs can be viewed in the console or sent to a logging service for analysis.
```
