# Fit Tool Flutter Package

The **fit_tool** Flutter package is designed to help developers create responsive layouts that adapt to various screen sizes and orientations. It provides a set of utilities that simplify the process of making UI components fit well on different devices, ensuring a consistent user experience across platforms.

## When to Use Fit Tool
- When building applications that need to support multiple screen sizes, such as tablets and smartphones.
- For projects where maintaining a consistent layout across different orientations (portrait and landscape) is crucial.
- When you want to avoid hardcoding dimensions and instead use relative sizing based on the screen dimensions.

## Key Features
- **Responsive Sizing**: Automatically adjusts the size of UI components based on the screen dimensions.
- **Orientation Handling**: Provides utilities to manage layout changes when the device orientation changes.
- **Customizable**: Allows developers to define their own breakpoints and scaling factors for more control over the layout.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Fit Tool

## Installation
To add the **fit_tool** package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  fit_tool: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using Fit Tool
To use the **fit_tool** package, you can import it into your Dart files:

```dart
import 'package:fit_tool/fit_tool.dart';
```

### Example Usage
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the **fit_tool** package to create a responsive layout:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fit_tool/fit_tool.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Use FitTool to get responsive dimensions
    double width = FitTool.getWidth(context, 0.8); // 80% of screen width
    double height = FitTool.getHeight(context, 0.5); // 50% of screen height

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Fit Tool Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Container(
          width: width,
          height: height,
          color: Colors.blue,
          child: Center(child: Text('Responsive Box', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white))),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to create a responsive box that adjusts its size based on the screen dimensions.

# Complete Example of Fit Tool

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fit_tool/fit_tool.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Use FitTool to get responsive dimensions
    double width = FitTool.getWidth(context, 0.8); // 80% of screen width
    double height = FitTool.getHeight(context, 0.5); // 50% of screen height

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Fit Tool Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Container(
            width: width,
            height: height,
            color: Colors.blue,
            child: Center(child: Text('Responsive Box', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white))),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds the main UI.
// 3. Inside the build method, FitTool is used to calculate the width and height of a Container.
// 4. The Container is set to 80% of the screen width and 50% of the screen height.
// 5. The Container is centered on the screen and displays a text label "Responsive Box".
// 6. The app adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a responsive design.
