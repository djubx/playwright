# gui_shape Flutter Package
The gui_shape Flutter package is a powerful tool for creating and manipulating shapes in Flutter applications. It provides a wide range of features, including shape morphing, animation, and gesture recognition.

## When to Use gui_shape
The gui_shape package is ideal for applications that require complex shape manipulation, such as:

* Games that involve shape-shifting characters or objects
* Interactive simulations that require dynamic shape changes
* Creative apps that allow users to manipulate shapes and designs

## Features
The gui_shape package offers the following features:

* Shape morphing: smoothly transform one shape into another
* Animation: animate shape changes over time
* Gesture recognition: respond to user gestures, such as taps and swipes
* Customizable: create custom shapes and animations

# Setting Up gui_shape
To use the gui_shape package, follow these steps:

1. Add the gui_shape package to your pubspec.yaml file:
```yml
dependencies:
  gui_shape: ^1.0.0
```
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.
3. Import the gui_shape package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:gui_shape/gui_shape.dart';
```
## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional setup is required for Android.

### iOS
To use gui_shape on iOS, you need to add the following line to your Info.plist file:
```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
  <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
  <true/>
</dict>
```
## Configurations and Optimizations
To optimize performance, you can adjust the following settings:

* `shapeCacheSize`: sets the number of shapes to cache
* `animationDuration`: sets the duration of shape animations

        title: Text('gui_shape Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Shape(
          // Create a circle shape
          shape: CircleShape(
            radius: 100,

              duration: Duration(milliseconds: 500),
              curve: Curves.easeInOut,
            );
          },
          // Morph the shape on swipe
          onSwipe: (direction) {
            if (direction == SwipeDirection.left) {
              _shapeController.morph(
                shape: RectangleShape(
                  width: 200,
                  height: 100,
                  fillColor: Colors.red,
                ),
              );
            } else if (direction == SwipeDirection.right) {
              _shapeController.morph(
                shape: CircleShape(
                  radius: 100,
                  fillColor: Colors.blue,
                ),
              );
            }
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user taps the shape, triggering the onTap callback.
// 2. The shape controller animates the shape over a duration of 500ms.
// 3. The user swipes the shape, triggering the onSwipe callback.
// 4. The shape controller morphs the shape into a new shape based on the swipe direction.
// 5. The shape is updated and rendered on the screen.

// In summary, this code demonstrates the key features of the gui_shape package, including shape animation and morphing, gesture recognition, and custom shape creation.
