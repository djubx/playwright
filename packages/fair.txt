# Exploring the "fair" Flutter Package

The "fair" Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to facilitate the development of cross-platform applications by providing a seamless way to integrate native functionalities into Flutter apps. It allows developers to write code once and deploy it across multiple platforms, including Android and iOS, while maintaining high performance and a native look and feel.

## When to Use "fair"

- **Cross-Platform Development**: When you want to share code between Android and iOS without compromising on performance.
- **Native Functionality**: If your application requires access to native device features such as camera, GPS, or sensors.
- **Performance Optimization**: When you need to optimize performance-critical parts of your application by leveraging native code.

## Key Features

- **Native Integration**: Easily call native APIs from Flutter.
- **Performance**: High-performance execution of native code.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Write once, run anywhere with minimal platform-specific code.
- **Ease of Use**: Simple API for integrating native functionalities.

The "fair" package is particularly useful for developers looking to maximize code reuse while still delivering a high-quality user experience across different platforms.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the "fair" Package

## Installation

To get started with the "fair" package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  fair: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/fair).

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

3. Add any necessary permissions in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file, depending on the native features you plan to use.

### iOS

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add any required permissions for native functionalities, such as camera access:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera for scanning QR codes.</string>
```

## Using the Package

Once the package is installed and configured, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to call a native function:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fair/fair.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Fair Package Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Call a native function
              var result = await Fair.callNative('nativeFunctionName', args: {'key': 'value'});
              print(result);
            },
            child: Text('Call Native Function'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app with a button that, when pressed, calls a native function using the `Fair.callNative` method. The result is printed to the console.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and start using the "fair" package in your Flutter applications effectively.

# Complete Example of Using the "fair" Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fair/fair.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Fair Package Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Call a native function
              var result = await Fair.callNative('nativeFunctionName', args: {'key': 'value'});
              print(result); // Print the result from the native function
            },
            child: Text('Call Native Function'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The main function is the entry point of the Flutter application.
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter widget
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main function, which calls runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds an ElevatedButton.
4. When the button is pressed, it triggers an asynchronous function that calls a native function using Fair.callNative.
5. The result of the native function call is printed to the console.
6. This demonstrates how to integrate native functionality into a Flutter app using the "fair" package.
