# Overview of the `shared_versions` Flutter Package

The `shared_versions` package is a powerful tool designed for managing and sharing versioning information across multiple Flutter packages within a monorepo setup. This package simplifies the process of maintaining consistent version numbers, making it easier for developers to manage dependencies and ensure compatibility across their projects.

## When to Use `shared_versions`

- **Monorepo Management**: If you are working with a monorepo that contains multiple Flutter packages, `shared_versions` can help you maintain consistent versioning across all packages.
- **Dependency Management**: It is particularly useful when you have interdependent packages that need to be updated together.
- **Automated Versioning**: The package can automate the versioning process, reducing the risk of human error.

## Key Features

- **Centralized Version Control**: Manage version numbers from a single location.
- **Automated Updates**: Automatically update version numbers across all packages.
- **Compatibility Checks**: Ensure that all packages are compatible with each other by maintaining consistent versioning.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate into existing Flutter projects.

# Setting Up and Using the `shared_versions` Package

## Installation

To get started with the `shared_versions` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  shared_versions: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run the following command to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file is configured to use the correct versioning scheme. You may need to adjust the `versionCode` and `versionName` properties to align with the versioning managed by `shared_versions`.

### iOS

For iOS, open your `ios/Runner.xcodeproj` and ensure that the versioning settings in the project properties are set to use the versioning defined in your `pubspec.yaml`.

## Basic Usage

To use the `shared_versions` package, you will typically create a configuration file (e.g., `shared_versions.yaml`) in the root of your project. This file will define the versioning strategy and the packages that will share the version information.

Hereâ€™s an example of what your `shared_versions.yaml` might look like:

```yaml
version: 1.0.0
packages:
  - package_a
  - package_b
```

After setting up the configuration, you can run the following command to update the versions across your packages:

```bash
flutter pub run shared_versions:update
```

This command will read the `shared_versions.yaml` file and update the version numbers in the specified packages.

# Complete Example of Using `shared_versions`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:shared_versions/shared_versions.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Shared Versions Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: VersionDisplay(),
    );
  }
}

class VersionDisplay extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Fetch the current version from the shared_versions package
    final String version = SharedVersions.getVersion();

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Current Version'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Current Version: $version',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to VersionDisplay, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 4. In the VersionDisplay widget, we call SharedVersions.getVersion() to retrieve the current version.
// 5. The version is displayed in the center of the screen using a Text widget.
// 6. The app shows the current version managed by the shared_versions package, demonstrating its functionality.
