# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Carousel Custom Slider

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the `carousel_custom_slider` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  carousel_custom_slider: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:carousel_custom_slider/carousel_custom_slider.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Carousel Custom Slider
You can now use the `CarouselCustomSlider` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
CarouselCustomSlider(
  items: [
    Image.network('https://example.com/image1.jpg'),
    Image.network('https://example.com/image2.jpg'),
    Image.network('https://example.com/image3.jpg'),
  ],
  options: CarouselOptions(
    autoPlay: true,
    height: 200,
    enlargeCenterPage: true,
  ),
)
```

This code snippet creates a carousel slider that automatically plays through three images. The `enlargeCenterPage` option makes the center item larger, enhancing the visual appeal.

## Conclusion
With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the `carousel_custom_slider` package in your Flutter application. Experiment with different options and configurations to create a carousel that fits your app's design and functionality.

# Complete Example of Carousel Custom Slider

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:carousel_custom_slider/carousel_custom_slider.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Carousel Custom Slider Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Carousel Custom Slider'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: CarouselCustomSlider(
            items: [
              // Adding images to the carousel
              Image.network('https://example.com/image1.jpg'),
              Image.network('https://example.com/image2.jpg'),
              Image.network('https://example.com/image3.jpg'),
            ],
            options: CarouselOptions(
              autoPlay: true, // Enables auto-play for the carousel
              height: 200, // Sets the height of the carousel
              enlargeCenterPage: true, // Enlarges the center item
              aspectRatio: 16 / 9, // Sets the aspect ratio
              initialPage: 0, // Sets the initial page to display
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the Flutter application by calling runApp() with MyApp().
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, the CarouselCustomSlider is instantiated.
// 5. The items parameter takes a list of images to display in the carousel.
// 6. The options parameter configures the carousel's behavior, such as enabling auto-play and setting the height.
// 7. The carousel automatically transitions between images, providing a smooth user experience.
