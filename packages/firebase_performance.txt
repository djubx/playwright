# Tutorial: Setting Up Firebase Performance in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `firebase_performance` package in a Flutter application. We will cover platform-specific details for both Android and iOS.

## Step 1: Add Dependencies

First, add the `firebase_performance` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  firebase_core: ^latest_version
  firebase_performance: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the packages.

## Step 2: Configure Firebase

### Android Configuration

1. **Add Firebase to Your Android App**:
   - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Create a new project or select an existing one.
   - Add an Android app to your project and follow the instructions to download the `google-services.json` file.
   - Place the `google-services.json` file in the `android/app` directory.

2. **Update `android/build.gradle`**:
   ```groovy
   buildscript {
       dependencies {
           // Add this line
           classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.10' // Check for the latest version
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Update `android/app/build.gradle`**:
   ```groovy
   apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
   apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services' // Add this line

   dependencies {
       implementation platform('com.google.firebase:firebase-bom:30.0.0') // Check for the latest version
       implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-perf'
   }
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Add Firebase to Your iOS App**:
   - In the Firebase Console, add an iOS app and download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file.
   - Place the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file in the `ios/Runner` directory.

2. **Update `ios/Podfile`**:
   Ensure your `Podfile` has the following:
   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0' # or higher
   ```

3. **Install Pods**:
   Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   cd ios
   pod install
   ```

## Step 3: Initialize Firebase in Your App

In your `main.dart` file, initialize Firebase before running your app:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';
import 'package:firebase_performance/firebase_performance.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await Firebase.initializeApp();
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 4: Using Firebase Performance

You can now start using Firebase Performance in your app. Hereâ€™s how to create a trace:

```dart
final Trace myTrace = FirebasePerformance.instance.newTrace("my_trace");
myTrace.start();
// Your code to measure
myTrace.stop();
```

This will create a trace that measures the time taken for the code between `start()` and `stop()`.

With these steps, you have successfully set up the `firebase_performance` package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Firebase Performance in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';
import 'package:firebase_performance/firebase_performance.dart';

void main() async {
  // Ensure that widget binding is initialized
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  
  // Initialize Firebase
  await Firebase.initializeApp();
  
  // Run the app
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Firebase Performance Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Firebase Performance Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () async {
            // Start a trace to measure the performance of this operation
            final Trace trace = FirebasePerformance.instance.newTrace("button_click_trace");
            trace.start(); // Start the trace
            
            // Simulate a network request or heavy computation
            await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2)); // Simulating delay
            
            trace.stop(); // Stop the trace
            
            // Show a message after the operation
            ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
              SnackBar(content: Text('Operation completed!'))
            );
          },
          child: Text('Simulate Operation'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, initializing Firebase.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is displayed, containing a button.
// 4. When the button is pressed, a new trace is created and started.
// 5. A simulated delay (representing a network request or heavy computation) occurs.
// 6. The trace is stopped after the delay, and a message is displayed to the user.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application that uses the `firebase_performance` package to measure the performance of a simulated operation triggered by a button press. The application flow is straightforward: it initializes Firebase, displays a button, and upon pressing the button, it starts a trace, simulates a delay, and then stops the trace while providing feedback to the user.

This setup allows developers to monitor the performance of specific operations within their applications, helping to identify areas for optimization and improvement.
