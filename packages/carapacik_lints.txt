# Tutorial: Setting Up Carapacik Lints

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **carapacik_lints** package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter projects.

## Step 1: Adding the Package to Your Project

To get started, you need to add the **carapacik_lints** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  carapacik_lints: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/carapacik_lints).

## Step 2: Configuring Linting Rules

After adding the package, you need to configure the linting rules. Create a new file named `analysis_options.yaml` in the root of your Flutter project and add the following content:

```yaml
include: package:carapacik_lints/carapacik_lints.yaml
```

This configuration will include the default linting rules provided by the **carapacik_lints** package.

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configurations

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file is configured to use the latest version of the Kotlin plugin, as some linting rules may require it. Update the `build.gradle` file as follows:

```groovy
buildscript {
    ext.kotlin_version = '1.5.31' // Use the latest stable version
    dependencies {
        classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:$kotlin_version"
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your `ios/Podfile` is set to use the latest version of CocoaPods. You can update it by running:

```bash
pod repo update
```

## Step 4: Running the Linter

To run the linter, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
flutter analyze
```

This command will analyze your codebase and provide feedback based on the linting rules defined in your `analysis_options.yaml` file.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can successfully integrate the **carapacik_lints** package into your Flutter project, ensuring a higher standard of code quality and maintainability.

# Complete Example: Using Carapacik Lints in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Carapacik Lints Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Carapacik Lints Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Welcome to Carapacik Lints!',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action when button is pressed
                showDialog(
                  context: context,
                  builder: (BuildContext context) {
                    return AlertDialog(
                      title: Text('Hello!'),
                      content: Text('This is a demo of Carapacik Lints.'),
                      actions: <Widget>[
                        TextButton(
                          child: Text('Close'),
                          onPressed: () {
                            Navigator.of(context).pop();
                          },
                        ),
                      ],
                    );
                  },
                );
              },
              child: Text('Show Dialog'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to MyHomePage, which is the main screen of the app.
// 4. MyHomePage builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget containing a Column.
// 5. The Column has a Text widget displaying a welcome message and an ElevatedButton.
// 6. When the button is pressed, a dialog is shown with a message and a close button.
// 7. The close button dismisses the dialog when pressed.
```

// Final Summary:
// The application starts with the `main` function, which initializes the Flutter app. The `RealFlutter` class sets up the main structure of the app, including the theme and home page. The `MyHomePage` class contains the UI elements, including a welcome message and a button. When the button is pressed, a dialog appears, demonstrating interactivity. This example showcases how to integrate the **carapacik_lints** package while maintaining a clean and organized code structure.
