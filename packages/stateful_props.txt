# Exploring the `stateful_props` Flutter Package

The `stateful_props` package is a powerful tool designed to simplify state management in Flutter applications. It allows developers to create stateful widgets with properties that can be easily managed and updated, making it an excellent choice for applications that require dynamic UI updates based on user interactions or data changes.

## When to Use `stateful_props`
You might consider using `stateful_props` in scenarios such as:
- Building complex forms where the state of various fields needs to be managed.
- Creating interactive UI components that require frequent updates based on user input.
- Developing applications that need to maintain state across multiple screens or widgets.

## Key Features
- **Simplified State Management**: Easily manage state with minimal boilerplate code.
- **Reactive Properties**: Automatically rebuild widgets when properties change.
- **Customizable**: Define your own properties and behaviors for stateful widgets.
- **Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing Flutter state management solutions.

Overall, `stateful_props` enhances the developer experience by providing a straightforward way to manage state in Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `stateful_props`

## Installation
To get started with the `stateful_props` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and include the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  stateful_props: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/stateful_props).

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use `stateful_props`, you will create a class that extends `StatefulProps`. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to define a stateful widget with properties:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:stateful_props/stateful_props.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulProps {
  // Define a property
  final String title;

  RealFlutter({required this.title});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text(title)),
      body: Center(child: Text('Hello, $title!')),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple stateful widget that takes a title as a property and displays it in the app bar and body.

# Complete Example of `stateful_props`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:stateful_props/stateful_props.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulProps {
  // Define a property to hold the counter value
  int counter = 0;

  // Method to increment the counter
  void incrementCounter() {
    counter++; // Increment the counter
    // Notify the framework to rebuild the widget with the new counter value
    notifyListeners();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Stateful Props Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text(
                'You have pushed the button this many times:',
              ),
              Text(
                '$counter', // Display the current counter value
                style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline4,
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
        floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
          onPressed: incrementCounter, // Call incrementCounter on button press
          tooltip: 'Increment',
          child: Icon(Icons.add),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the app with RealFlutter as the root widget
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter initializes with a counter set to 0.
// 3. The build method constructs the UI, displaying the current counter value.
// 4. When the FloatingActionButton is pressed, the incrementCounter method is called.
// 5. The counter is incremented, and notifyListeners() is called to rebuild the widget.
// 6. The UI updates to reflect the new counter value, providing a reactive experience.
