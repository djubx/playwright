# Overview of the `cli_completion` Flutter Package

The `cli_completion` package is a powerful tool designed to enhance command-line interface (CLI) applications by providing intelligent command completion. This package is particularly useful for developers who are building CLI tools and want to offer users a more intuitive and efficient way to interact with their applications.

## When to Use `cli_completion`

- **Enhanced User Experience**: If your CLI application has a complex set of commands, `cli_completion` can help users by suggesting possible commands and options as they type.
- **Productivity Boost**: By reducing the need to remember exact command syntax, users can work more efficiently.
- **Error Reduction**: With command suggestions, users are less likely to make syntax errors, leading to smoother operation.

## Key Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Customizable Suggestions**: Developers can define custom completion logic to suit their application's needs.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup and integration process with existing Flutter applications.

# Setting Up and Using `cli_completion` in Flutter

In this section, we'll walk through the process of setting up the `cli_completion` package in a Flutter project and demonstrate how to use it effectively.

## Setup Process

1. **Add Dependency**: First, add the `cli_completion` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     cli_completion: ^1.0.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run `flutter pub get` to install the new package.

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21.
   - **iOS**: No additional configuration is required for iOS.

## Using the Package

To use `cli_completion`, you need to import it into your Dart file and set up the completion logic. Here's a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:cli_completion/cli_completion.dart';

void main() {
  RealFlutter app = RealFlutter();
  app.run();
}

class RealFlutter {
  void run() {
    // Initialize CLI completion
    Completion completion = Completion();
    
    // Define completion logic
    completion.addCompletion('start', ['--verbose', '--debug']);
    completion.addCompletion('stop', ['--force', '--quiet']);
    
    // Start the CLI application
    completion.listen();
  }
}
```

In this example, we define a simple CLI application with two commands: `start` and `stop`, each with its own set of options.

<-- MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cli_completion/cli_completion.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'CLI Completion Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  final Completion completion = Completion();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize CLI completion with commands and options
    completion.addCompletion('build', ['--release', '--debug']);
    completion.addCompletion('clean', ['--all', '--cache']);
    // Start listening for CLI input
    completion.listen();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('CLI Completion Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Use the CLI to interact with this app.',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code sets up a basic Flutter application with CLI completion.
// The `main` function initializes the Flutter app and runs `MyApp`.
// `MyApp` is a stateless widget that sets up the MaterialApp with a home page.
// `MyHomePage` is a stateful widget where the CLI completion is configured.
// In `initState`, we define two commands: `build` and `clean`, each with options.
// The `completion.listen()` method starts listening for CLI input to provide suggestions.
// The UI consists of a simple centered text instructing users to use the CLI.
