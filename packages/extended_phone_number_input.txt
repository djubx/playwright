# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Extended Phone Number Input Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `extended_phone_number_input` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  extended_phone_number_input: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions for internet access if you plan to use features that require network connectivity. Add the following line inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if your app requires access to the user's contacts or other sensitive information. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSContactsUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to contacts for phone number input.</string>
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the phone number input field.

# Complete Example of Using Extended Phone Number Input

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:extended_phone_number_input/extended_phone_number_input.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Phone Number Input Example',
      home: PhoneNumberInputScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PhoneNumberInputScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PhoneNumberInputScreenState createState() => _PhoneNumberInputScreenState();
}

class _PhoneNumberInputScreenState extends State<PhoneNumberInputScreen> {
  // Controller for the phone number input
  final TextEditingController _phoneController = TextEditingController();
  String _formattedPhoneNumber = '';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Phone Number Input'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            // Phone number input field
            ExtendedPhoneNumberInput(
              controller: _phoneController,
              onChanged: (value) {
                // Update the formatted phone number on change
                setState(() {
                  _formattedPhoneNumber = value;
                });
              },
              // Optional: Set the initial country code
              initialCountryCode: 'US',
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Display the formatted phone number
            Text('Formatted Phone Number: $_formattedPhoneNumber'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to submit the phone number
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Handle the submission of the phone number
                print('Submitted Phone Number: $_formattedPhoneNumber');
              },
              child: Text('Submit'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application that uses the extended_phone_number_input package.
// 
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget sets up a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The PhoneNumberInputScreen widget is a stateful widget that manages the phone number input.
// 4. A TextEditingController is created to control the input field.
// 5. The ExtendedPhoneNumberInput widget is used to create the phone number input field.
//    - The onChanged callback updates the formatted phone number whenever the user types.
//    - The initialCountryCode is set to 'US' to default to the United States.
// 6. The formatted phone number is displayed below the input field.
// 7. An ElevatedButton is provided to submit the phone number, which prints the formatted number to the console.
// 
// This application flow allows users to input their phone numbers easily, with real-time formatting and validation.
