Here's a detailed technical blog on the "css_text" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# CSS Text Flutter Package

The `css_text` package for Flutter is a powerful tool that allows developers to style text using CSS-like syntax. This package is particularly useful for those who are familiar with web development and want to leverage similar styling capabilities in their Flutter applications. 

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the `css_text` package in scenarios such as:
- **Dynamic Text Styling**: When you need to apply different styles to text dynamically based on user input or data fetched from an API.
- **Complex Text Layouts**: If your application requires complex text layouts that are easier to manage with CSS-like syntax.
- **Consistency Across Platforms**: When you want to maintain a consistent styling approach across web and mobile platforms.

## Features

- **CSS-like Syntax**: Use familiar CSS properties to style text, making it easier for web developers to transition to Flutter.
- **Rich Text Support**: Supports rich text formatting, allowing for multiple styles within a single text widget.
- **Customizable**: Easily extendable to include custom styles and properties.

## Example Usage

Here’s a simple example of how you might use the `css_text` package:

```dart
import 'package:css_text/css_text.dart';

Text(
  cssText('color: red; font-size: 20px;'),
);
```

In this example, the text will be displayed in red with a font size of 20 pixels. This demonstrates the ease of applying styles using CSS-like syntax.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the CSS Text Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `css_text` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  css_text: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

Once you have added the dependency, import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:css_text/css_text.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

You can now use the `css_text` package to style your text. Here’s how to do it for both Android and iOS:

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, make sure to enable the necessary permissions in your `Info.plist` if you are fetching data from the internet or using any specific features.

## Example Usage

Here’s a simple example of how to use the `css_text` package in a Flutter application:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:css_text/css_text.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('CSS Text Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(
            cssText('color: blue; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the text will be displayed in blue, with a font size of 24 pixels and bold weight. This demonstrates how easy it is to apply styles using the `css_text` package.

# Complete Example of CSS Text Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:css_text/css_text.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'CSS Text Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('CSS Text Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying styled text using css_text
              Text(
                cssText('color: green; font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold;'),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between texts
              // Another styled text
              Text(
                cssText('color: orange; font-size: 20px; text-decoration: underline;'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'CSS Text Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Column widget.
// 5. Inside the Column, two Text widgets are displayed, each styled using the css_text package.
// 6. The first Text widget is styled to be green, bold, and 30 pixels in size.
// 7. A SizedBox is used to add space between the two Text widgets.
// 8. The second Text widget is styled to be orange, underlined, and 20 pixels in size.
// 9. The application demonstrates how to use the css_text package to style text dynamically.
