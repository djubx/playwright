```dart
Future<void> createPdf() async {
  // Define the HTML content
  String htmlContent = "<h1>Hello, World!</h1><p>This is a PDF generated from HTML.</p>";

  // Specify the output file path
  String outputFilePath = "/storage/emulated/0/Download/example.pdf";

  // Create the PDF
  await FlutterHtmlToPdf.convertFromHtmlContent(
    htmlContent,
    outputFilePath,
    "example.pdf",
    1,
    1,
  );
}
```

3. Call the `createPdf` function when needed, such as in a button's `onPressed` callback.

# Complete Example of flutter_html_to_pdf

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_html_to_pdf/flutter_html_to_pdf.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'HTML to PDF Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  // Function to create PDF from HTML content
  Future<void> createPdf() async {
    // Define the HTML content
    String htmlContent = "<h1>Hello, World!</h1><p>This is a PDF generated from HTML.</p>";

    // Specify the output file path
    String outputFilePath = "/storage/emulated/0/Download/example.pdf";

    // Create the PDF
    await FlutterHtmlToPdf.convertFromHtmlContent(
      htmlContent,
      outputFilePath,
      "example.pdf",
      1,
      1,
    );

    // Notify the user that the PDF has been created
    print("PDF created at: $outputFilePath");
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('HTML to PDF Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Call the createPdf function when the button is pressed
            createPdf();
          },
          child: Text('Generate PDF'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter contains a button that, when pressed, calls the createPdf function.
// 4. The createPdf function defines HTML content and specifies the output file path.
// 5. It then calls the convertFromHtmlContent method to generate the PDF.
// 6. Finally, it prints the location of the created PDF to the console.
```
