# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_font_icons

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `flutter_font_icons` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_font_icons: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_font_icons/flutter_font_icons.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using Icons in Your Application

You can now use the icons in your Flutter widgets. Hereâ€™s how to use an icon from the FontAwesome set:

```dart
Icon(
  FontAwesome.home, // Using the home icon from FontAwesome
  size: 30.0, // Setting the size of the icon
  color: Colors.blue, // Setting the color of the icon
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details

- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid compatibility issues.
  
  ```gradle
  android {
      ...
      defaultConfig {
          ...
          minSdkVersion 21
      }
  }
  ```

- **iOS**: No specific configurations are required for iOS, but ensure that your deployment target is set appropriately in `ios/Podfile`.

## Step 5: Customizing Icons

You can customize the icons further by wrapping them in other widgets, such as `Container` or `GestureDetector`, to add padding, margins, or tap functionality.

```dart
GestureDetector(
  onTap: () {
    // Handle icon tap
  },
  child: Container(
    padding: EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
    child: Icon(
      FontAwesome.home,
      size: 30.0,
      color: Colors.blue,
    ),
  ),
)
```

With these steps, you can effectively integrate and use the `flutter_font_icons` package in your Flutter applications.

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Font Icons Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Font Icons'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying a FontAwesome home icon
              Icon(
                FontAwesome.home,
                size: 50.0, // Setting the size of the icon
                color: Colors.blue, // Setting the color of the icon
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              // Displaying a Material icon
              Icon(
                MaterialIcons.favorite,
                size: 50.0, // Setting the size of the icon
                color: Colors.red, // Setting the color of the icon
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              // Displaying a custom icon with tap functionality
              GestureDetector(
                onTap: () {
                  // Handle icon tap
                  print('Icon tapped!');
                },
                child: Icon(
                  FontAwesome.user,
                  size: 50.0, // Setting the size of the icon
                  color: Colors.green, // Setting the color of the icon
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Flutter Font Icons'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Column widget.
// 5. Inside the Column, three icons are displayed:
//    - The first icon is a home icon from FontAwesome, colored blue.
//    - The second icon is a favorite icon from Material Icons, colored red.
//    - The third icon is a user icon from FontAwesome, colored green, and wrapped in a GestureDetector to handle taps.
// 6. When the user taps the user icon, a message is printed to the console.
