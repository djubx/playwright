## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_sliding_tutorial` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_sliding_tutorial: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_sliding_tutorial/flutter_sliding_tutorial.dart';
```

## Step 4: Creating the Tutorial Slides

You can create a list of slides that will be displayed in the tutorial. Each slide can contain a title, description, and an image.

### Example Slide Structure

```dart
final List<Slide> slides = [
  Slide(
    title: "Welcome to RealFlutter",
    description: "Discover the amazing features of our app.",
    image: "assets/images/welcome.png",
  ),
  Slide(
    title: "Feature 1",
    description: "Learn about the first feature.",
    image: "assets/images/feature1.png",
  ),
  // Add more slides as needed
];
```

## Step 5: Implementing the Tutorial

You can now implement the tutorial in your main widget. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return SlidingTutorial(
    slides: slides,
    onFinish: () {
      // Navigate to the main application screen
      Navigator.of(context).pushReplacement(
        MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => MainAppScreen()),
      );
    },
  );
}
```

## Platform-Specific Details

# Complete Example of flutter_sliding_tutorial

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_sliding_tutorial/flutter_sliding_tutorial.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'RealFlutter Tutorial',
      home: TutorialScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class TutorialScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  // Define the slides for the tutorial
  final List<Slide> slides = [
    Slide(
      title: "Welcome to RealFlutter",
      description: "Discover the amazing features of our app.",
      image: "assets/images/welcome.png",
    ),
    Slide(
      title: "Feature 1",
      description: "Learn about the first feature.",
      image: "assets/images/feature1.png",
    ),
    Slide(
      title: "Feature 2",
      description: "Explore the second feature.",
      image: "assets/images/feature2.png",
    ),
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return SlidingTutorial(
      slides: slides,
      onFinish: () {
        // Navigate to the main application screen
        Navigator.of(context).pushReplacement(
          MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => MainAppScreen()),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

class MainAppScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Main Application'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to the main application!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home screen.
// 3. The TutorialScreen widget is displayed, which contains the sliding tutorial.
// 4. The slides are defined with titles, descriptions, and images.
// 5. When the user finishes the tutorial, they are navigated to the MainAppScreen.
// 6. The MainAppScreen displays a simple welcome message to the user.
```
