# Overview of the `freezed_annotation` Flutter Package

The `freezed_annotation` package is a powerful tool in the Flutter ecosystem that simplifies the process of creating immutable data classes. It leverages code generation to provide a concise and efficient way to define data models, making it easier to manage state and data flow in Flutter applications. 

## When to Use `freezed_annotation`

You should consider using `freezed_annotation` when:
- You need to create immutable data classes that require equality checks.
- You want to simplify the process of creating copy methods and serialization/deserialization logic.
- You are working with complex data structures that benefit from union types or sealed classes.

## Key Features
- **Immutable Data Classes**: Automatically generates immutable classes with a simple syntax.
- **Copying**: Provides a convenient way to create modified copies of objects.
- **Equality and Hashing**: Implements `==` and `hashCode` for value equality.
- **Union Types**: Supports creating union types, allowing for more expressive data models.
- **Code Generation**: Reduces boilerplate code through code generation, making your codebase cleaner and more maintainable.

In summary, `freezed_annotation` is an essential package for Flutter developers looking to streamline their data modeling process while ensuring immutability and type safety.

# Setting Up and Using `freezed_annotation`

## Step 1: Add Dependencies

To get started with `freezed_annotation`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Additionally, you will need the `build_runner` and `freezed` packages for code generation.

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  freezed_annotation: ^2.0.0

dev_dependencies:
  build_runner: ^2.0.0
  freezed: ^2.0.0
```

## Step 2: Create Your Data Class

Create a new Dart file for your data class, for example, `real_flutter.dart`. Use the `@freezed` annotation to define your class.

```dart
import 'package:freezed_annotation/freezed_annotation.dart';

part 'real_flutter.freezed.dart';

@freezed
class RealFlutter with _$RealFlutter {
  const factory RealFlutter({
    required String name,
    required int age,
  }) = _RealFlutter;
}
```

## Step 3: Run Code Generation

After defining your data class, run the following command in your terminal to generate the necessary code:

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build
```

This command will create a file named `real_flutter.freezed.dart` containing the generated code.

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid compatibility issues.

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile` to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using Your Data Class

You can now use your `RealFlutter` class in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create an instance and use its methods.

```dart
void main() {
  final person = RealFlutter(name: 'John Doe', age: 30);
  print(person); // Output: RealFlutter(name: John Doe, age: 30)
}
```

This setup allows you to leverage the full power of `freezed_annotation` in your Flutter applications, making your data handling more efficient and less error-prone.

# Complete Example of Using `freezed_annotation`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:freezed_annotation/freezed_annotation.dart';

part 'real_flutter.freezed.dart'; // Import the generated file

// Define the RealFlutter class using the @freezed annotation
@freezed
class RealFlutter with _$RealFlutter {
  const factory RealFlutter({
    required String name,
    required int age,
  }) = _RealFlutter; // The private implementation class
}

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp()); // Start the Flutter application
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Freezed Annotation Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Freezed Annotation Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: PersonWidget(), // Display the PersonWidget
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class PersonWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create an instance of RealFlutter
    final person = RealFlutter(name: 'John Doe', age: 30);
    
    // Display the person's information
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Text('Name: ${person.name}'), // Access the name property
        Text('Age: ${person.age}'), // Access the age property
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the Flutter application by calling runApp() with MyApp().
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a centered PersonWidget.
// 3. The PersonWidget creates an instance of RealFlutter with a name and age.
// 4. The widget displays the name and age of the person using Text widgets.
