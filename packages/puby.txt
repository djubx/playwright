# Exploring the "puby" Flutter Package

The "puby" package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who want to simplify the process of managing and utilizing public APIs in their applications. It provides a streamlined way to handle API requests, responses, and error management, making it an excellent choice for developers looking to integrate external data sources into their Flutter apps.

## When to Use "puby"

You should consider using "puby" when:
- You need to interact with public APIs frequently.
- You want to simplify the process of making HTTP requests and handling responses.
- You are looking for a package that provides built-in error handling and response parsing.

## Key Features

- **Simplified API Requests**: Easily make GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests with minimal boilerplate code.
- **Automatic JSON Parsing**: Automatically parse JSON responses into Dart objects.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in mechanisms to handle common HTTP errors gracefully.
- **Customizable**: Allows for customization of headers, query parameters, and request bodies.

With these features, "puby" can significantly reduce the complexity of working with APIs in Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using "puby"

## Installation

To add the "puby" package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  puby: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/puby).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to add permissions for network access in your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage

To use "puby" in your Flutter application, you can create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class and start making API calls. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to fetch data from a public API:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:puby/puby.dart';

class RealFlutter {
  final Puby puby = Puby();

  Future<void> fetchData() async {
    try {
      final response = await puby.get('https://api.example.com/data');
      // Handle the response
      print(response.data);
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle errors
      print('Error: $e');
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, we create an instance of `RealFlutter`, which uses the `puby` package to make a GET request to a public API. The response is printed to the console, and any errors are caught and printed as well.

# Complete Example of Using "puby"

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:puby/puby.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Puby Example',
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomePageState createState() => _HomePageState();
}

class _HomePageState extends State<HomePage> {
  final Puby puby = Puby(); // Create an instance of Puby
  String data = ''; // Variable to hold the fetched data

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    fetchData(); // Fetch data when the widget is initialized
  }

  Future<void> fetchData() async {
    try {
      final response = await puby.get('https://api.example.com/data'); // Make a GET request
      setState(() {
        data = response.data; // Update the state with the fetched data
      });
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        data = 'Error: $e'; // Update the state with the error message
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Puby Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(data), // Display the fetched data or error message
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home page (HomePage).
// 3. HomePage is a stateful widget that initializes the data variable to hold fetched data.
// 4. In the initState method, fetchData is called to retrieve data from the API.
// 5. fetchData makes a GET request using the puby package and updates the state with the response data.
// 6. If an error occurs, the error message is set in the state.
// 7. The build method displays the fetched data or error message in the center of the screen.
