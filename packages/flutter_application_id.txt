# Setup and Usage
=====================

To use the `flutter_application_id` package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Pubspec File

Add the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  flutter_application_id: ^1.0.0
```
### Step 2: Import the Package

Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:flutter_application_id/flutter_application_id.dart';
```
### Step 3: Access the Application ID

Use the `FlutterApplicationId` class to access the application ID:
```dart
String appId = await FlutterApplicationId.getApplicationId();
```
### Platform-Specific Configurations

#### Android

On Android, the application ID is accessed using the `getPackageName()` method of the `Context` class. The `FlutterApplicationId` class uses this method to access the application ID.

#### iOS

On iOS, the application ID is accessed using the `bundleIdentifier` property of the `NSBundle` class. The `FlutterApplicationId` class uses this property to access the application ID.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_application_id/flutter_application_id.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Application ID Demo',
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  String _appId = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _getAppId();
  }

  Future<void> _getAppId() async {
    // Access the application ID using the FlutterApplicationId class
    String appId = await FlutterApplicationId.getApplicationId();
    setState(() {
      _appId = appId;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Application ID Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Application ID: $_appId'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application flow:
// 1. The app starts and the MyApp widget is created.
// 2. The MyApp widget builds the MyHomePage widget.
// 3. The MyHomePage widget initializes the _appId variable and calls the _getAppId method.
// 4. The _getAppId method accesses the application ID using the FlutterApplicationId class.
// 5. The application ID is stored in the _appId variable and the widget is updated.
// 6. The updated widget is displayed on the screen with the application ID.

// Summary:
// The code flows by initializing the app, accessing the application ID, and displaying it on the screen.
