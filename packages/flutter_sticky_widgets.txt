# Complete Example: Implementing Sticky Widgets

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_sticky_widgets/flutter_sticky_widgets.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Sticky Widgets Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Sticky Widgets Demo'),
        ),
        body: StickyHeaderList(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class StickyHeaderList extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return StickyHeader(
      header: Container(
        color: Colors.blue,
        height: 50.0,
        alignment: Alignment.center,
        child: Text(
          'Sticky Header',
          style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
        ),
      ),
      content: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: 100,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return Container(
            height: 50.0,
            color: index.isEven ? Colors.grey[300] : Colors.white,
            alignment: Alignment.center,
            child: Text('Item $index'),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold containing an AppBar and the StickyHeaderList.
// 3. StickyHeaderList creates a StickyHeader widget, which has a header and a content area.
// 4. The header is a blue container with the text 'Sticky Header'.
// 5. The content is a ListView.builder that generates 100 items, alternating between grey and white backgrounds.
// 6. As the user scrolls, the header remains at the top of the screen, providing a sticky effect.
```
