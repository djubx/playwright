# Overview of the otp_timer Flutter Package

The `otp_timer` package is a Flutter library designed to facilitate the implementation of one-time password (OTP) timers in mobile applications. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where user authentication is required, such as logging in, signing up, or verifying transactions. By providing a countdown timer, it enhances user experience by visually indicating the time remaining to enter the OTP.

## When to Use `otp_timer`
- **User Authentication**: When implementing OTP-based authentication flows.
- **Transaction Verification**: For confirming sensitive transactions via OTP.
- **Time-sensitive Actions**: Any feature that requires a time limit for user actions.

## Key Features
- **Customizable Timer**: Easily set the duration of the timer.
- **Visual Feedback**: Provides a countdown display that updates in real-time.
- **Callbacks**: Allows developers to define actions when the timer expires.
- **Styling Options**: Offers various styling options to match the app's theme.

Overall, `otp_timer` is a straightforward yet powerful tool for managing OTP timers in Flutter applications, making it a valuable addition to any developer's toolkit.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the otp_timer Package

## Installation
To use the `otp_timer` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  otp_timer: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No specific configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package
To use the `otp_timer` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:otp_timer/otp_timer.dart';
```

You can then create an instance of the `OtpTimer` widget in your UI. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
OtpTimer(
  duration: Duration(seconds: 30), // Set the timer duration
  onTimerExpire: () {
    // Action to perform when the timer expires
    print("Timer expired!");
  },
  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, color: Colors.red), // Customize the timer style
)
```

This widget will display a countdown timer and execute the `onTimerExpire` callback when the time runs out. You can customize the duration and style as needed.

With these steps, you can easily integrate the `otp_timer` package into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using otp_timer

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:otp_timer/otp_timer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'OTP Timer Example',
      home: OtpTimerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class OtpTimerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _OtpTimerScreenState createState() => _OtpTimerScreenState();
}

class _OtpTimerScreenState extends State<OtpTimerScreen> {
  // State variable to control the timer
  bool _isTimerActive = false;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('OTP Timer Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the OTP timer
            OtpTimer(
              duration: Duration(seconds: 30), // Set the timer duration
              onTimerExpire: () {
                // Action to perform when the timer expires
                setState(() {
                  _isTimerActive = false; // Update the state to indicate timer is inactive
                });
                print("Timer expired!"); // Log the expiration
              },
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.blue), // Customize the timer style
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to start the timer
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _isTimerActive
                  ? null // Disable button if timer is active
                  : () {
                      setState(() {
                        _isTimerActive = true; // Update the state to indicate timer is active
                      });
                      print("Timer started!"); // Log the start of the timer
                    },
              child: Text('Start Timer'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and home screen set to OtpTimerScreen.
// 3. OtpTimerScreen is a stateful widget that manages the timer state.
// 4. The build method displays an OtpTimer widget and a button to start the timer.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the timer starts, and the button is disabled.
// 6. The timer counts down from 30 seconds, and when it expires, it triggers the onTimerExpire callback.
// 7. The callback updates the state to indicate that the timer is no longer active and logs the expiration.
