# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Simple File Saver

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the **simple_file_saver** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  simple_file_saver: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/simple_file_saver).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to write to external storage. Add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you need to add a usage description in your `Info.plist` file to inform users why your app needs access to their files:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your photo library to save files.</string>
<key>NSDocumentsDirectoryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your documents directory to save files.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to save a text file.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simple_file_saver/simple_file_saver.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Simple File Saver Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Define the content and file name
              String content = "Hello, this is a test file!";
              String fileName = "test_file.txt";

              // Save the file
              await SimpleFileSaver.saveFile(fileName, content);
              // Show a success message
              ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                SnackBar(content: Text('File saved successfully!')),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Save File'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, a text file named `test_file.txt` is created with the specified content.

# Complete Example of Simple File Saver

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simple_file_saver/simple_file_saver.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Simple File Saver Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Define the content and file name
              String content = "Hello, this is a test file!";
              String fileName = "test_file.txt";

              // Save the file
              await SimpleFileSaver.saveFile(fileName, content);
              // Show a success message
              ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                SnackBar(content: Text('File saved successfully!')),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Save File'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title "Simple File Saver Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 5. An ElevatedButton is created, which, when pressed, triggers the onPressed callback.
// 6. Inside the onPressed callback, the content and file name are defined.
// 7. The SimpleFileSaver.saveFile method is called to save the file with the specified content.
// 8. After saving the file, a SnackBar is displayed to inform the user that the file was saved successfully.
