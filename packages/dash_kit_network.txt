<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Dash Kit Network Flutter Package

The **dash_kit_network** package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers to simplify network operations in their applications. It provides a robust set of features that streamline the process of making API calls, handling responses, and managing errors. This package is particularly useful for applications that require frequent data fetching from remote servers, such as social media apps, e-commerce platforms, and news aggregators.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the **dash_kit_network** package when:
- You need to make multiple API calls and want to manage them efficiently.
- You want to handle different types of responses (e.g., JSON, XML) seamlessly.
- You require built-in error handling and retry mechanisms.
- You are looking for a way to simplify the integration of network requests in your Flutter application.

## Key Features
- **Easy API Integration**: Simplifies the process of making HTTP requests.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in mechanisms to handle various error scenarios.
- **Response Parsing**: Automatically parses responses into usable data models.
- **Retry Logic**: Configurable retry strategies for failed requests.
- **Support for Interceptors**: Allows you to modify requests and responses globally.

With these features, the **dash_kit_network** package can significantly reduce the boilerplate code associated with network operations in Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Dash Kit Network

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **dash_kit_network** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **dash_kit_network** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dash_kit_network: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/dash_kit_network).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `Info.plist` to allow network requests:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in a Flutter application.

1. **Import the Package**:

```dart
import 'package:dash_kit_network/dash_kit_network.dart';
```

2. **Create a Network Client**:

You can create a network client instance that will be used to make API calls.

```dart
final networkClient = NetworkClient();
```

3. **Making a GET Request**:

Hereâ€™s how to make a simple GET request:

```dart
void fetchData() async {
  try {
    final response = await networkClient.get('https://api.example.com/data');
    // Handle the response
  } catch (e) {
    // Handle error
  }
}
```

4. **Handling Responses**:

The package automatically parses the response. You can access the data like this:

```dart
if (response.isSuccessful) {
  final data = response.data; // Your parsed data
} else {
  // Handle error response
}
```

5. **Error Handling**:

The package provides built-in error handling. You can catch exceptions and handle them accordingly.

```dart
catch (NetworkException e) {
  // Handle network-specific errors
}
```

With these steps, you can easily integrate the **dash_kit_network** package into your Flutter application and start making network requests.

# Complete Example of Dash Kit Network

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dash_kit_network/dash_kit_network.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dash Kit Network Example',
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomePageState createState() => _HomePageState();
}

class _HomePageState extends State<HomePage> {
  final NetworkClient networkClient = NetworkClient(); // Create a network client
  String data = ''; // Variable to hold fetched data
  String errorMessage = ''; // Variable to hold error messages

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    fetchData(); // Fetch data when the widget is initialized
  }

  // Function to fetch data from the API
  void fetchData() async {
    try {
      final response = await networkClient.get('https://api.example.com/data'); // Make a GET request
      if (response.isSuccessful) {
        setState(() {
          data = response.data; // Update the state with the fetched data
          errorMessage = ''; // Clear any previous error messages
        });
      } else {
        setState(() {
          errorMessage = 'Error: ${response.error}'; // Update the state with the error message
        });
      }
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        errorMessage = 'Network Error: $e'; // Handle network errors
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Dash Kit Network Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: errorMessage.isNotEmpty
            ? Text(errorMessage) // Display error message if any
            : Text(data.isNotEmpty ? data : 'Loading...'), // Display fetched data or loading message
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home page.
// 3. The HomePage widget initializes a NetworkClient instance and a state to hold data and error messages.
// 4. In the initState method, fetchData is called to retrieve data from the API.
// 5. The fetchData method makes a GET request to the specified URL.
// 6. If the response is successful, the data is stored in the state; otherwise, an error message is displayed.
// 7. The build method updates the UI based on the current state, showing either the fetched data or an error message.
```
