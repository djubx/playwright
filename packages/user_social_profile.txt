# Complete Example of User Social Profile Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:user_social_profile/user_social_profile.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'User Social Profile Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(), // Main widget to display user profile
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  UserProfile? userProfile; // Variable to hold user profile data

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    fetchUserProfile(); // Fetch user profile data on initialization
  }

  // Method to fetch user profile data
  void fetchUserProfile() async {
    try {
      userProfile = await UserSocialProfile.fetchProfile(); // Fetching profile
      setState(() {}); // Update UI after fetching data
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error fetching user profile: $e'); // Handle errors
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('User Social Profile'),
      ),
      body: userProfile == null // Check if user profile data is available
          ? Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator()) // Show loading indicator
          : Column(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              children: [
                Text('Name: ${userProfile!.name}'), // Display user name
                Text('Email: ${userProfile!.email}'), // Display user email
                Image.network(userProfile!.profilePicture), // Display profile picture
              ],
            ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is the home screen, where user profile data will be displayed.
// 3. In the _RealFlutterState class, the fetchUserProfile method is called in initState to retrieve user data.
// 4. If the user profile data is not yet available, a loading indicator is shown.
// 5. Once the data is fetched, the UI is updated to display the user's name, email, and profile picture.
