# Declarative Animated List Flutter Package

The `declarative_animated_list` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to create dynamic and visually appealing lists with smooth animations. This package allows you to build lists that can be updated declaratively, meaning that you can easily add, remove, or modify items in the list while maintaining a seamless user experience.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `declarative_animated_list` package in scenarios where:

- You need to display a list of items that can change frequently, such as a chat application, a shopping cart, or a feed of posts.
- You want to enhance the user experience with animations that provide visual feedback when items are added or removed.
- You prefer a declarative approach to building UI, which aligns with Flutter's design philosophy.

## Features

- **Declarative API**: Easily manage the state of your list and update it without worrying about the underlying implementation details.
- **Smooth Animations**: Built-in animations for adding, removing, and updating items in the list.
- **Customizable**: You can customize the animations and the appearance of the list items to fit your app's design.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Efficiently handles large lists with minimal performance overhead.

Overall, the `declarative_animated_list` package simplifies the process of creating animated lists in Flutter, making it a valuable addition to any developer's toolkit.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Declarative Animated List

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `declarative_animated_list` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `declarative_animated_list` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  declarative_animated_list: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install Packages

Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the platform version in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a declarative animated list.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:declarative_animated_list/declarative_animated_list.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // List to hold the items
  List<String> items = [];

  // Function to add a new item
  void _addItem() {
    setState(() {
      items.add('Item ${items.length + 1}');
    });
  }

  // Function to remove the last item
  void _removeItem() {
    if (items.isNotEmpty) {
      setState(() {
        items.removeLast();
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Declarative Animated List Example'),
        ),
        body: Column(
          children: [
            // Buttons to add and remove items
            Row(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              children: [
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: _addItem,
                  child: Text('Add Item'),
                ),
                SizedBox(width: 20),
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: _removeItem,
                  child: Text('Remove Item'),
                ),
              ],
            ),
            // Animated list widget
            Expanded(
              child: DeclarativeAnimatedList<String>(
                itemBuilder: (context, item, animation, index) {
                  // Build each item with animation
                  return SizeTransition(
                    sizeFactor: animation,
                    child: ListTile(
                      title: Text(item),
                    ),
                  );
                },
                items: items,
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatefulWidget that maintains a list of items.
// 3. The _addItem function adds a new item to the list and calls setState to update the UI.
// 4. The _removeItem function removes the last item from the list if it is not empty.
// 5. The build method creates a MaterialApp with an AppBar and a Column containing buttons to add and remove items.
// 6. The DeclarativeAnimatedList widget displays the list of items with animations for adding and removing.
// 7. Each item is wrapped in a SizeTransition to animate its appearance and disappearance.
