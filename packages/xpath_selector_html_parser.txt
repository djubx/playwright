# Tutorial

## Setup Process

To get started with the `xpath_selector_html_parser` package, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     xpath_selector_html_parser: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

     ```groovy
     android {
         ...
         defaultConfig {
             ...
             minSdkVersion 21
         }
     }
     ```

   - **iOS**: For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

     ```ruby
     platform :ios, '10.0'
     ```

## Using the Package

Once the package is set up, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Here’s a simple example of how to parse HTML content:

1. **Import the Package**:

   ```dart
   import 'package:xpath_selector_html_parser/xpath_selector_html_parser.dart';
   ```

2. **Parse HTML**:

   You can parse HTML content using the `HtmlParser` class provided by the package. Here’s a basic example:

   ```dart
   String htmlContent = '<html><body><h1>Hello World</h1></body></html>';
   var document = HtmlParser.parse(htmlContent);
   var title = document.querySelector('h1')?.text; // Extracts "Hello World"
   ```

3. **Error Handling**: Always ensure to handle potential errors when parsing HTML, such as malformed HTML or invalid XPath queries.

By following these steps, you can effectively set up and utilize the `xpath_selector_html_parser` package in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:xpath_selector_html_parser/xpath_selector_html_parser.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'XPath Selector HTML Parser Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('HTML Parser Example'),
        ),
        body: HtmlParserWidget(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class HtmlParserWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample HTML content to parse
    String htmlContent = '''
      <html>
        <body>
          <h1>Welcome to RealFlutter</h1>
          <p>This is a simple example of using xpath_selector_html_parser.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Feature 1: Easy to use</li>
            <li>Feature 2: Lightweight</li>
            <li>Feature 3: Cross-platform</li>
          </ul>
        </body>
      </html>
    ''';

    // Parse the HTML content
    var document = HtmlParser.parse(htmlContent);
    
    // Extracting data using XPath
    var title = document.querySelector('h1')?.text; // Extracts the title
    var paragraph = document.querySelector('p')?.text; // Extracts the paragraph
    var features = document.querySelectorAll('li').map((e) => e.text).toList(); // Extracts list items

    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
      child: Column(
        crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
        children: [
          Text(title ?? 'No Title', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold)),
          SizedBox(height: 10),
          Text(paragraph ?? 'No Content', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16)),
          SizedBox(height: 20),
          Text('Features:', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold)),
          ...features.map((feature) => Text('- $feature')).toList(), // Displaying features
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold containing an AppBar and the HtmlParserWidget.
// 3. The HtmlParserWidget contains a sample HTML string that includes a header, a paragraph, and a list of features.
// 4. The HTML content is parsed using the HtmlParser class, and specific elements are extracted using XPath selectors.
// 5. The extracted data (title, paragraph, and features) is displayed in a column layout within the widget.
// 6. The app showcases how to parse and display HTML content dynamically using the xpath_selector_html_parser package.
