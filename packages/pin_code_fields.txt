# Overview of the `pin_code_fields` Flutter Package

The `pin_code_fields` package is a powerful and flexible Flutter package designed to create customizable PIN code input fields. This package is particularly useful for applications that require user authentication, such as login screens, two-factor authentication, or any scenario where a secure PIN is needed.

## When to Use `pin_code_fields`

You should consider using the `pin_code_fields` package in the following scenarios:

- **User Authentication**: When your application requires users to enter a PIN for login or verification.
- **Secure Transactions**: For applications that involve financial transactions where a PIN is necessary for security.
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: When implementing additional security measures that require a PIN sent via SMS or email.

## Features

- **Customizable UI**: The package allows you to customize the appearance of the PIN fields, including colors, shapes, and sizes.
- **Input Validation**: It provides built-in validation to ensure that the entered PIN meets specific criteria.
- **Keyboard Type Support**: You can specify the keyboard type for the input fields, enhancing user experience.
- **Animation Support**: The package includes animations for input transitions, making the UI more engaging.

Overall, the `pin_code_fields` package is an excellent choice for developers looking to implement secure and user-friendly PIN input fields in their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `pin_code_fields`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `pin_code_fields` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  pin_code_fields: ^7.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` file to allow for any necessary permissions, especially if you are using SMS for PIN verification.

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to upload your profile picture.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a PIN code input field.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pin_code_fields/pin_code_fields.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('PIN Code Input')),
        body: Center(
          child: Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
            child: PinCodeTextField(
              appContext: context,
              length: 4,
              onChanged: (value) {
                // Handle changes to the input
              },
              onCompleted: (value) {
                // Handle the completed PIN input
                print("Entered PIN: $value");
              },
              pinTheme: PinTheme(
                shape: PinCodeFieldShape.box,
                borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(5),
                fieldHeight: 50,
                fieldWidth: 40,
                activeFillColor: Colors.white,
                inactiveFillColor: Colors.grey[200],
                selectedFillColor: Colors.blue[100],
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with a PIN code input field. The `PinCodeTextField` widget is used to create the input field, and we customize its appearance using the `pinTheme` property.

# Complete Example of `pin_code_fields`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pin_code_fields/pin_code_fields.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('PIN Code Input')),
        body: Center(
          child: Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
            child: PinCodeTextField(
              appContext: context,
              length: 4, // Number of digits in the PIN
              onChanged: (value) {
                // This callback is triggered when the input changes
              },
              onCompleted: (value) {
                // This callback is triggered when the input is completed
                print("Entered PIN: $value");
              },
              pinTheme: PinTheme(
                shape: PinCodeFieldShape.box, // Shape of the PIN field
                borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(5), // Rounded corners
                fieldHeight: 50, // Height of each field
                fieldWidth: 40, // Width of each field
                activeFillColor: Colors.white, // Color when field is active
                inactiveFillColor: Colors.grey[200], // Color when field is inactive
                selectedFillColor: Colors.blue[100], // Color when field is selected
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the `RealFlutter` class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The `MaterialApp` widget is created, providing the basic structure of the app.
// 3. A `Scaffold` widget is used to create the app's visual structure, including an AppBar and a body.
// 4. Inside the body, a `Center` widget is used to center the content.
// 5. A `Padding` widget adds space around the `PinCodeTextField`.
// 6. The `PinCodeTextField` widget is configured with a length of 4, meaning it expects a 4-digit PIN.
// 7. The `onChanged` callback is triggered whenever the input changes, allowing for real-time updates.
// 8. The `onCompleted` callback is triggered when the user has entered all 4 digits, where the entered PIN is printed to the console.
// 9. The `pinTheme` property customizes the appearance of the PIN fields, including shape, size, and colors.
