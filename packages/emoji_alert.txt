# Complete Example of Using the Emoji Alert Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:emoji_alert/emoji_alert.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Emoji Alert Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Emoji Alert Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Show a success alert when the button is pressed
              EmojiAlert.show(
                context: context,
                title: 'Success!',
                message: 'Your operation was successful! üéâ',
                emoji: 'üéâ',
              );
            },
            child: Text('Show Success Alert'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Emoji Alert Demo'.
// 4. In the body of the Scaffold, a Center widget is used to center an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the EmojiAlert.show() method is called to display a success alert.
// 6. The alert shows a title, message, and an emoji, enhancing the user experience with visual feedback.
