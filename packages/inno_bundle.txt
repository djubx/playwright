# Inno_Bundle Flutter Package: A Comprehensive Overview

The **inno_bundle** package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers to streamline the process of managing and utilizing various resources within their applications. This package is particularly useful for applications that require a structured way to handle assets, configurations, and localization.

## When to Use Inno_Bundle
- **Asset Management**: When your application has multiple assets (images, fonts, etc.) that need to be organized and accessed efficiently.
- **Configuration Handling**: For applications that require dynamic configuration settings that can be easily modified without changing the codebase.
- **Localization**: When you need to support multiple languages and want a clean way to manage translations.

## Key Features
- **Centralized Asset Management**: Easily manage and access all your assets from a single location.
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Load configuration settings at runtime, allowing for flexible application behavior.
- **Localization Support**: Simplified handling of multiple languages and translations.

The **inno_bundle** package is an excellent choice for developers looking to enhance their Flutter applications with organized resource management and localization capabilities.

# Inno_Bundle Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the **inno_bundle** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  inno_bundle: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/inno_bundle).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21.

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add any necessary permissions or configurations required by your application.

## Basic Usage
After installation, you can start using the **inno_bundle** package in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to load assets and configurations.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:inno_bundle/inno_bundle.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Inno Bundle Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Load configuration and assets using Inno_Bundle
    final config = InnoBundle.loadConfig('config.json');
    final image = InnoBundle.loadAsset('images/logo.png');

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text(config['appName']),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Image.asset(image),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we load a configuration file and an image asset using the **inno_bundle** package. The `loadConfig` method retrieves settings from a JSON file, while `loadAsset` fetches the specified image.

This setup provides a solid foundation for utilizing the **inno_bundle** package in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Inno_Bundle in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:inno_bundle/inno_bundle.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Inno Bundle Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Load configuration and assets using Inno_Bundle
    final config = InnoBundle.loadConfig('config.json'); // Load configuration from JSON
    final image = InnoBundle.loadAsset('images/logo.png'); // Load image asset

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text(config['appName']), // Set app name from config
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Image.asset(image), // Display loaded image
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. HomeScreen is a StatelessWidget that builds the UI.
// 4. Inside HomeScreen, we load configuration settings from a JSON file using InnoBundle.loadConfig.
// 5. We also load an image asset using InnoBundle.loadAsset.
// 6. The AppBar displays the app name retrieved from the configuration.
// 7. The body of the Scaffold centers the loaded image on the screen.
