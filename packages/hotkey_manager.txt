# Hotkey Manager Flutter Package

The **hotkey_manager** Flutter package is a powerful tool that allows developers to manage keyboard shortcuts (hotkeys) in their Flutter applications. This package is particularly useful for desktop applications where keyboard shortcuts can enhance user experience by providing quick access to functionalities without navigating through menus.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the **hotkey_manager** package in scenarios such as:
- Building desktop applications where keyboard shortcuts can improve productivity.
- Creating applications that require accessibility features, allowing users to navigate using the keyboard.
- Implementing custom shortcuts for specific actions within your app, such as saving, opening files, or executing commands.

## Features

- **Global Hotkeys**: Register hotkeys that work even when the application is not in focus.
- **Contextual Hotkeys**: Define hotkeys that are only active in specific contexts or screens.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API for adding and managing hotkeys in your Flutter application.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it versatile for desktop applications.

With these features, the **hotkey_manager** package can significantly enhance the usability of your Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Hotkey Manager Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **hotkey_manager** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  hotkey_manager: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### For Android

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Ensure you have the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW"/>
```

### For iOS

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to allow the app to register hotkeys:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires microphone access to register hotkeys.</string>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to register a global hotkey.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:hotkey_manager/hotkey_manager.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _registerHotkeys();
  }

  void _registerHotkeys() async {
    // Register a global hotkey (Ctrl + H)
    final hotkey = HotKey(KeyCode.control, KeyCode.keyH);
    await hotkeyManager.register(hotkey, (key) {
      // Action to perform when the hotkey is pressed
      print("Hotkey Ctrl + H pressed!");
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the hotkey when the widget is removed
    hotkeyManager.unregisterAll();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Hotkey Manager Example')),
        body: Center(child: Text('Press Ctrl + H')),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **HotKey Registration**: The `_registerHotkeys` method registers a global hotkey (Ctrl + H) that triggers an action when pressed.
- **HotKey Disposal**: The `dispose` method ensures that all registered hotkeys are unregistered when the widget is removed from the widget tree.

With this setup, you can now use the hotkey manager in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Hotkey Manager in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:hotkey_manager/hotkey_manager.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _registerHotkeys(); // Call the method to register hotkeys
  }

  void _registerHotkeys() async {
    // Register a global hotkey (Ctrl + H)
    final hotkey = HotKey(KeyCode.control, KeyCode.keyH);
    await hotkeyManager.register(hotkey, (key) {
      // Action to perform when the hotkey is pressed
      print("Hotkey Ctrl + H pressed!"); // Print message to console
      // You can add more actions here, like showing a dialog or navigating
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the hotkey when the widget is removed
    hotkeyManager.unregisterAll(); // Unregister all hotkeys
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Hotkey Manager Example')),
        body: Center(child: Text('Press Ctrl + H')), // Instruction to user
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the initState method, the _registerHotkeys method is called to register the hotkey.
// 3. The hotkey (Ctrl + H) is registered, and when pressed, it triggers the callback that prints a message to the console.
// 4. The dispose method ensures that all hotkeys are unregistered when the widget is removed from the widget tree, preventing memory leaks.
// 5. The UI consists of a simple Scaffold with an AppBar and a centered text instruction for the user to press Ctrl + H.
```
