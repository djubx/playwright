# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_glow

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `flutter_glow` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_glow: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using flutter_glow in Your Application

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to apply a glow effect to a button:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_glow/flutter_glow.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Glow Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: GlowButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Action when button is pressed
            },
            glowColor: Colors.blue,
            child: Text('Press Me', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white)),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple button with a glowing effect. The `GlowButton` widget is used to wrap the button, and we specify the `glowColor` to customize the glow.

# Complete Example of flutter_glow

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_glow/flutter_glow.dart';

// Main class of the application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Glow Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Center widget to align the button in the middle of the screen
          child: GlowButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Action when button is pressed
              print('Button Pressed!'); // Log button press
            },
            glowColor: Colors.blue, // Set the glow color
            child: Text(
              'Press Me', // Text displayed on the button
              style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white), // Text color
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp, which provides the basic structure of the app.
3. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold widget is created, which includes an AppBar and a body.
4. The body contains a Center widget that centers its child, which is a GlowButton.
5. The GlowButton is configured with an onPressed callback that prints a message to the console when pressed.
6. The glowColor property is set to blue, giving the button a glowing effect.
7. The application displays a button in the center of the screen, and when pressed, it triggers the defined action.
