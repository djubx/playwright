# Tutorial: Setting Up Channel Talk Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **channel_talk_flutter** package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the **channel_talk_flutter** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  channel_talk_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/channel_talk_flutter).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

3. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following entries to allow network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Initialize Channel Talk

In your main Dart file, you need to initialize the Channel Talk service. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:channel_talk_flutter/channel_talk_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Channel Talk Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize Channel Talk with your unique channel key
    ChannelTalk.init('YOUR_CHANNEL_KEY');
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Channel Talk Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Open the Channel Talk chat window
            ChannelTalk.showChat();
          },
          child: Text('Open Chat'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this code, we initialize the Channel Talk service with a unique channel key and provide a button to open the chat window.

# Complete Example: Channel Talk Flutter Integration

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:channel_talk_flutter/channel_talk_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Channel Talk Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize Channel Talk with your unique channel key
    ChannelTalk.init('YOUR_CHANNEL_KEY');
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Channel Talk Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Open the Channel Talk chat window
            ChannelTalk.showChat();
          },
          child: Text('Open Chat'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the Flutter application by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. HomeScreen is a StatefulWidget that manages its state.
// 4. In the initState method, we initialize the Channel Talk service with a unique channel key.
// 5. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget containing an ElevatedButton.
// 6. When the button is pressed, the Channel Talk chat window opens, allowing users to interact with support agents or other users.
