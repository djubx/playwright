# class_to_map Flutter Package

The `class_to_map` package is a powerful utility for Flutter developers that simplifies the process of converting Dart classes to and from maps. This is particularly useful when working with APIs, local storage, or any scenario where you need to serialize and deserialize data. By automating the conversion process, `class_to_map` helps reduce boilerplate code and minimizes the risk of errors.

## When to Use

- **API Integration**: When fetching data from a REST API, you often need to convert JSON responses into Dart objects. This package streamlines that process.
- **Local Storage**: If you're saving data locally (e.g., using SharedPreferences or SQLite), converting your data models to maps is essential.
- **Data Serialization**: When you need to serialize your data models for network transmission or storage.

## Features

- **Automatic Conversion**: Easily convert Dart classes to maps and vice versa with minimal setup.
- **Customizable**: Supports custom serialization logic for complex data types.
- **Type Safety**: Maintains type safety during the conversion process, reducing runtime errors.

Overall, `class_to_map` is an essential tool for any Flutter developer looking to simplify data handling in their applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using class_to_map

## Installation

To add the `class_to_map` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  class_to_map: ^latest_version
```

Replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/class_to_map).

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 9.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
```

## Basic Usage

1. **Define Your Class**: Create a Dart class that you want to convert to a map.
2. **Use the Package**: Utilize the provided methods to convert your class to a map and vice versa.

Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:class_to_map/class_to_map.dart';

class RealFlutter {
  String name;
  int age;

  RealFlutter({required this.name, required this.age});
}

// Convert to map
Map<String, dynamic> toMap(RealFlutter realFlutter) {
  return realFlutter.toMap();
}

// Convert from map
RealFlutter fromMap(Map<String, dynamic> map) {
  return RealFlutter.fromMap(map);
}
```

This setup allows you to easily convert instances of `RealFlutter` to maps and back, facilitating data handling in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of class_to_map in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:class_to_map/class_to_map.dart';

// Define the RealFlutter class with class_to_map annotations
part 'real_flutter.g.dart'; // This is where the generated code will be

@ClassToMap()
class RealFlutter {
  String name;
  int age;

  RealFlutter({required this.name, required this.age});
}

// Main function to run the app
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// MyApp widget
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'class_to_map Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

// HomeScreen widget
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create an instance of RealFlutter
    RealFlutter person = RealFlutter(name: 'John Doe', age: 30);

    // Convert the instance to a map
    Map<String, dynamic> personMap = person.toMap();

    // Convert the map back to an instance
    RealFlutter newPerson = RealFlutter.fromMap(personMap);

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('class_to_map Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Original Person: ${person.name}, Age: ${person.age}'),
            Text('Converted Person: ${newPerson.name}, Age: ${newPerson.age}'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main() function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget creates an instance of RealFlutter with a name and age.
// 4. It converts this instance to a map using the toMap() method.
// 5. The map is then converted back to a RealFlutter instance using fromMap().
// 6. Finally, the original and converted person's details are displayed on the screen.
