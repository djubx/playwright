# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Giffy Dialog

## Installation

To use the giffy_dialog package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  giffy_dialog: ^2.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using Giffy Dialog

To use the giffy_dialog package, you can create a dialog by calling the `GiffyDialog` class. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:giffy_dialog/giffy_dialog.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Giffy Dialog Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              showDialog(
                context: context,
                builder: (context) => GiffyDialog(
                  image: Image.asset('assets/loading.gif'),
                  title: Text('Loading'),
                  description: Text('Please wait while we load your data.'),
                  entryAnimation: EntryAnimation.TOP,
                  onOkButtonPressed: () {
                    Navigator.of(context).pop();
                  },
                ),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Show Giffy Dialog'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, a Giffy dialog appears with a loading GIF, a title, and a description. The dialog can be dismissed by pressing the OK button.

                  image: Image.asset('assets/loading.gif'),
                  // Set the title of the dialog
                  title: Text('Loading'),
                  // Set the description of the dialog
                  description: Text('Please wait while we load your data.'),
                  // Set the entry animation for the dialog
                  entryAnimation: EntryAnimation.TOP,
                  // Define the action for the OK button
                  onOkButtonPressed: () {
                    // Close the dialog when the OK button is pressed
                    Navigator.of(context).pop();
                  },
                ),
              );
            },
            // Button text
            child: Text('Show Giffy Dialog'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'Giffy Dialog Example'.
// 4. The body contains a Center widget that centers its child, which is an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the showDialog function is called to display the Giffy Dialog.
// 6. The Giffy Dialog is configured with an image, title, description, and an OK button.
// 7. Pressing the OK button will close the dialog by popping it from the navigation stack.
