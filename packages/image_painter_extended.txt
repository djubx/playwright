**Final Summary**

In this tutorial, we demonstrated how to use the 'image_painter_extended' package to paint and edit images within a Flutter app. We showed how to implement the RealFlutter class, use the `paint` method to paint the image, and use the `undo` and `redo` methods to undo and redo painting actions. We also showed how to save the edited image using the `save` method. This package provides a powerful tool for image editing within Flutter apps, and can be used in a variety of applications such as photo editing apps, graphic design apps, and social media apps.
