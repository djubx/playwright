## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the platform version in your `ios/Podfile`:

platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage

To use the `widgets_easier` package, you can import it into your Dart files:

```dart
import 'package:widgets_easier/widgets_easier.dart';
```

You can then start using the pre-built widgets in your Flutter application. For example, you can create a simple button using the `EasyButton` widget:

```dart
EasyButton(
  onPressed: () {
    print("Button Pressed!");
  },
  child: Text("Click Me"),
);
```

This button will automatically adapt to the theme of your application and provide a consistent look and feel.

# Complete Example of Using `widgets_easier`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:widgets_easier/widgets_easier.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Widgets Easier Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Widgets Easier Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: EasyButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Action to perform when the button is pressed
            ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
              SnackBar(content: Text('Button Pressed!')),
            );
          },
          child: Text("Click Me"),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to HomePage, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 4. HomePage builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, an EasyButton is created.
// 6. When the EasyButton is pressed, a SnackBar is displayed at the bottom of the screen.
// 7. The SnackBar shows a message indicating that the button was pressed.
