Here's a detailed technical blog on the `mobx_codegen` Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Overview of the `mobx_codegen` Flutter Package

The `mobx_codegen` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that simplifies state management using the MobX library. MobX is a state management library that makes it easy to manage the state of your application in a reactive way. The `mobx_codegen` package provides code generation capabilities that allow developers to define observables, actions, and reactions in a more concise and maintainable manner.

## When to Use `mobx_codegen`

You should consider using `mobx_codegen` in your Flutter applications when:
- You need a reactive state management solution that is easy to understand and implement.
- You want to reduce boilerplate code associated with state management.
- You are building complex applications where state changes frequently and needs to be reflected in the UI.

## Features of `mobx_codegen`

- **Code Generation**: Automatically generates boilerplate code for observables, actions, and reactions, reducing manual coding.
- **Reactive Programming**: Allows you to create reactive data models that automatically update the UI when the underlying data changes.
- **Integration with Flutter**: Works seamlessly with Flutter's widget lifecycle, making it easy to integrate into existing applications.

By leveraging `mobx_codegen`, developers can focus on building features rather than managing state, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `mobx_codegen`

## Step 1: Add Dependencies

To get started with `mobx_codegen`, you need to add the necessary dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Include both `mobx` and `mobx_codegen`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  mobx: ^2.0.0

dev_dependencies:
  build_runner: ^2.0.0
  mobx_codegen: ^2.0.0
```

## Step 2: Create Your Store

Create a new Dart file for your MobX store. For this example, we will create a file named `real_flutter_store.dart`. In this file, we will define our `RealFlutter` class.

```dart
import 'package:mobx/mobx.dart';

part 'real_flutter_store.g.dart'; // This line is necessary for code generation

class RealFlutter = _RealFlutter with _$RealFlutter;

abstract class _RealFlutter with Store {
  @observable
  int counter = 0; // Observable variable

  @action
  void increment() {
    counter++; // Action to modify the observable
  }
}
```

## Step 3: Generate Code

To generate the necessary code, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build
```

This command will create a file named `real_flutter_store.g.dart` that contains the generated code for your store.

## Step 4: Use the Store in Your Flutter App

Now that you have your store set up, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s how to integrate it into your main application file.

### Platform-Specific Details

- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21.
- **iOS**: Make sure to enable Swift support in your iOS project if you are using any Swift code.

# Complete Example of Using `mobx_codegen`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mobx/mobx.dart';
import 'real_flutter_store.dart'; // Importing the store

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp()); // Starting the Flutter application
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'MobX Codegen Example',
      home: HomePage(), // Setting the home page
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  final RealFlutter store = RealFlutter(); // Creating an instance of the store

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('MobX Codegen Example'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Observer(
              builder: (_) => Text(
                'Counter: ${store.counter}', // Displaying the counter value
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: store.increment, // Incrementing the counter on button press
              child: Text('Increment'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the Flutter application by calling runApp() with MyApp().
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets HomePage as the home widget.
// 3. HomePage creates an instance of RealFlutter, which is our MobX store.
// 4. The Observer widget listens for changes in the store's counter variable.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the increment() action is called, which updates the counter.
// 6. The Observer automatically rebuilds the Text widget to reflect the updated counter value.
```
