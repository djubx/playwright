Here's a detailed technical blog on the "tex" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Overview of the "tex" Flutter Package

The `tex` Flutter package is a powerful tool for rendering LaTeX equations and mathematical expressions in Flutter applications. It allows developers to display complex mathematical notations seamlessly, making it an excellent choice for educational apps, scientific applications, or any app that requires mathematical representation.

## When to Use the `tex` Package

You should consider using the `tex` package in scenarios such as:
- **Educational Applications**: When building apps that teach mathematics or physics, where equations are frequently displayed.
- **Scientific Research Apps**: For applications that require the presentation of complex formulas and equations.
- **Technical Documentation**: When creating apps that need to display technical content with mathematical expressions.

## Features of the `tex` Package

- **LaTeX Support**: Full support for LaTeX syntax, allowing for a wide range of mathematical expressions.
- **Customizable Styles**: Options to customize the appearance of the rendered equations.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on both Android and iOS, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate into existing Flutter applications with minimal setup.

With these features, the `tex` package stands out as a robust solution for rendering mathematical content in Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the `tex` Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `tex` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  tex: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/tex).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to enable the use of Swift in your project. Open your `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode and ensure that the project settings are configured to support Swift.

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the `tex` package:

```dart
import 'package:tex/tex.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the `Tex` widget to render LaTeX equations. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
Tex(
  r'\frac{a}{b} = c',
  textStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
)
```

This will render the equation \( \frac{a}{b} = c \) with a font size of 24.

## Step 5: Running Your Application

After setting everything up, run your application using:

```bash
flutter run
```

You should see the rendered LaTeX equations in your Flutter app. Make sure to test on both Android and iOS devices to ensure compatibility.

With these steps, you can successfully integrate the `tex` package into your Flutter application and start rendering mathematical expressions.

# Complete Example of Using the `tex` Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tex/tex.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Tex Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Tex Package Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Rendering a simple LaTeX equation
              Tex(
                r'\frac{a}{b} = c',
                textStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between equations
              // Rendering a more complex LaTeX equation
              Tex(
                r'E = mc^2',
                textStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between equations
              // Another example of a LaTeX equation
              Tex(
                r'\int_{a}^{b} x^2 \, dx',
                textStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Tex Package Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Column widget.
// 5. Inside the Column, multiple Tex widgets are used to render LaTeX equations.
// 6. Each Tex widget displays a different mathematical expression, with a specified text style.
// 7. SizedBox widgets are used to add spacing between the equations for better readability.
```
