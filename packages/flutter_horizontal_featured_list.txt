        ],
        itemBuilder: (context, item) {
          return Card(
            child: Column(
              children: [
                Image.network(item.imageUrl), // Display the image
                Text(item.title), // Display the title
              ],
            ),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body containing the HorizontalFeaturedList.
// 4. The HorizontalFeaturedList takes a list of FeaturedItem objects, each with a title and image URL.
// 5. The itemBuilder function is used to define how each item should be displayed, using a Card widget to show the image and title.
// 6. The app will display a horizontally scrollable list of featured items, allowing users to swipe through them easily.
