import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bones_ui_bootstrap/bones_ui_bootstrap.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a theme for the application
    ThemeData theme = ThemeData(
      primaryColor: Colors.blue,
      accentColor: Colors.red,
    );

    // Create the RealFlutter widget
    return RealFlutter(
      title: 'My App',
      theme: theme,
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('My App'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Hello, World!'),
        ),
