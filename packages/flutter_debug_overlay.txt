# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_debug_overlay

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_debug_overlay` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_debug_overlay` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_debug_overlay: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_debug_overlay).

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_debug_overlay/flutter_debug_overlay.dart';
```

## Step 3: Initializing the Overlay

You need to initialize the debug overlay in your main application file. This is typically done in the `main()` function. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
  FlutterDebugOverlay.init();
}
```

## Step 4: Configuring Platform-Specific Settings

### For Android

Ensure that your Android project is set up to allow overlays. You may need to add the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW"/>
```

### For iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable the overlay in your app's settings. Ensure that your app's Info.plist includes the necessary permissions.

## Step 5: Using the Overlay

You can now use the overlay in your application. To display the overlay, simply call:

```dart
FlutterDebugOverlay.show();
```

You can also customize the overlay by passing parameters to the `show()` method, such as enabling or disabling specific features.

## Conclusion

With these steps, you have successfully set up the `flutter_debug_overlay` package in your Flutter application. You can now leverage its features to enhance your debugging process and improve your app's performance.

# Complete Example of flutter_debug_overlay

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_debug_overlay/flutter_debug_overlay.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the Flutter application
  runApp(RealFlutterApp());
  // Initialize the debug overlay
  FlutterDebugOverlay.init();
}

class RealFlutterApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Debug Overlay Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Debug Overlay Example'),
        actions: [
          // Button to show the debug overlay
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.bug_report),
            onPressed: () {
              // Show the debug overlay
              FlutterDebugOverlay.show();
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Press the bug icon to show the debug overlay.',
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Simulate a state change
                // This could be a state management call in a real app
                print('Button Pressed!');
              },
              child: Text('Press Me'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main() function initializes the Flutter application and the debug overlay.
// 2. The RealFlutterApp class builds the main MaterialApp widget.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is displayed as the home screen of the app.
// 4. The AppBar contains a button that, when pressed, shows the debug overlay.
// 5. The body of the HomeScreen contains a message and a button.
// 6. Pressing the button simulates a state change, which can be monitored in the debug overlay.
```
