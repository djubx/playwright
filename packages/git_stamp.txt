# Overview of the git_stamp Flutter Package

The `git_stamp` package is a Flutter library designed to help developers manage and display Git commit information within their applications. This package is particularly useful for applications that require versioning information, such as mobile apps that need to show the current build version or commit details for debugging and tracking purposes.

## When to Use `git_stamp`
- **Version Tracking**: When you want to display the current version of your app based on Git commits.
- **Debugging**: To provide developers with quick access to the commit history and details during development.
- **Build Information**: To show users the specific build they are using, which can be helpful for support and troubleshooting.

## Key Features
- **Retrieve Git Commit Information**: Easily access the latest commit hash, author, and date.
- **Customizable Output**: Format the output to suit your application's needs.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

# Setting Up and Using the git_stamp Package

## Installation
To use the `git_stamp` package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  git_stamp: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package
To use the `git_stamp` package, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:git_stamp/git_stamp.dart';
```

You can then retrieve the commit information as follows:

```dart
void main() async {
  final gitInfo = await GitStamp.getGitInfo();
  print('Commit Hash: ${gitInfo.commitHash}');
  print('Author: ${gitInfo.author}');
  print('Date: ${gitInfo.date}');
}
```

This code snippet retrieves the latest Git commit information and prints it to the console.

# Complete Example of Using git_stamp

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:git_stamp/git_stamp.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Git Stamp Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Git Stamp Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: FutureBuilder<GitInfo>(
            // Using FutureBuilder to handle asynchronous data fetching
            future: GitStamp.getGitInfo(),
            builder: (context, snapshot) {
              if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                // While waiting for the data, show a loading indicator
                return CircularProgressIndicator();
              } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
                // If there is an error, display it
                return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}');
              } else {
                // Once data is fetched, display the commit information
                final gitInfo = snapshot.data!;
                return Column(
                  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
                  children: [
                    Text('Commit Hash: ${gitInfo.commitHash}'),
                    Text('Author: ${gitInfo.author}'),
                    Text('Date: ${gitInfo.date}'),
                  ],
                );
              }
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, a FutureBuilder is used to fetch Git information asynchronously.
// 4. While the data is being fetched, a CircularProgressIndicator is displayed.
// 5. If an error occurs during fetching, it is displayed on the screen.
// 6. Once the data is successfully fetched, the commit hash, author, and date are displayed in a column format.

### Summary
In this blog post, we explored the `git_stamp` Flutter package, which allows developers to easily access and display Git commit information in their applications. We covered the installation process, platform-specific configurations, and provided a complete example demonstrating how to use the package effectively. The application flow was explained step-by-step through comments in the code, making it easier for developers to understand how to implement this package in their own projects.
