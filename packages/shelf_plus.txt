You should consider using `shelf_plus` in scenarios where you need to:

- Build a lightweight web server for your Flutter web application.
- Handle HTTP requests and responses efficiently.
- Implement middleware for logging, authentication, or other processing tasks.
- Serve static files or create RESTful APIs.

### Key Features

- **Enhanced Middleware Support**: Easily create and manage middleware for request processing.
- **Static File Serving**: Serve static files from your Flutter application seamlessly.
- **Routing Capabilities**: Simplify the routing of requests to different handlers.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in mechanisms for handling errors and exceptions gracefully.

## Part 2: Tutorial

# Setting Up and Using the `shelf_plus` Package

## Installation

To get started with `shelf_plus`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  shelf_plus: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Setup

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to access the internet. Add the following line inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` to allow arbitrary loads if you are testing with HTTP. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage

To use `shelf_plus`, you need to create a simple server. Here’s a basic example of how to set up a server that responds to HTTP requests:

```dart
import 'package:shelf_plus/shelf_plus.dart';

void main() {
  // Create a new shelf_plus server
  final server = ShelfPlus();

  // Define a simple handler
  server.get('/', (Request request) {
    return Response.ok('Hello, World!');
  });

  // Start the server on localhost:8080
  server.start('localhost', 8080);
}
```

This code sets up a basic server that listens on `localhost:8080` and responds with "Hello, World!" when accessed.

## Part 3: Complete Example

<!-- START_MAIN -->
# Complete Example of Using `shelf_plus`

Here’s a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the `shelf_plus` package.

```dart
import 'package:shelf_plus/shelf_plus.dart';
import 'package:shelf/shelf.dart';
import 'package:shelf/shelf.dart' as shelf;

void main() {
  // Create a new instance of ShelfPlus
  final server = ShelfPlus();

  // Middleware for logging requests
  final logRequests = createMiddleware(
    requestHandler: (Request request) {
      print('Request for ${request.url}');
      return null; // Continue to the next handler
    },
  );

  // Define a simple handler for the root path
  final handler = (Request request) {
    return Response.ok('Hello, World!');
  };

  // Add middleware and handler to the server
  server.addMiddleware(logRequests);
  server.get('/', handler);

  // Serve static files from the 'public' directory
  server.mount('/static/', shelf.createStaticHandler('public'));

  // Start the server on localhost:8080
  server.start('localhost', 8080);
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes a new instance of ShelfPlus.
// 2. A middleware function is created to log incoming requests.
// 3. A simple handler is defined to respond with "Hello, World!" for the root path.
// 4. The middleware is added to the server, followed by the handler.
// 5. The server is configured to serve static files from the 'public' directory.
// 6. Finally, the server starts listening on localhost:8080, ready to handle requests.
```

### Summary

In this blog, we explored the `shelf_plus` Flutter package, detailing its features, setup process, and providing a complete example of its usage. The application flow is straightforward: it initializes a server, logs requests, handles a simple response, and serves static files, demonstrating the package's capabilities effectively. This makes `shelf_plus` a valuable tool for Flutter developers looking to build web applications with ease.
