# Complete Example of Easy Quiz Game

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:easy_quiz_game/easy_quiz_game.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Easy Quiz Game',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: QuizPage(),
    );
  }
}

class QuizPage extends StatelessWidget {
  // Define a list of questions for the quiz
  final List<Question> questions = [
    Question(
      question: "What is the capital of France?",
      options: ["Berlin", "Madrid", "Paris", "Lisbon"],
      correctAnswer: "Paris",
    ),
    Question(
      question: "What is 2 + 2?",
      options: ["3", "4", "5", "6"],
      correctAnswer: "4",
    ),
    // Add more questions as needed
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Quiz Time!'),
      ),
      body: Quiz(
        questions: questions,
        onFinish: (score) {
          // Show the score when the quiz is finished
          showDialog(
            context: context,
            builder: (context) {
              return AlertDialog(
                title: Text('Quiz Finished!'),
                content: Text('Your score is: $score'),
                actions: [
                  TextButton(
                    onPressed: () {
                      Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                    },
                    child: Text('OK'),
                  ),
                ],
              );
            },
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home of the app is set to QuizPage, which contains the quiz logic.
// 4. In QuizPage, a list of questions is defined with options and correct answers.
// 5. The Quiz widget is used to display the questions and handle user interactions.
// 6. When the quiz is finished, the onFinish callback is triggered, showing the user's score in a dialog.
