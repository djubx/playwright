# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `string_literal_finder`

## Installation
To get started with the `string_literal_finder` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  string_literal_finder: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/string_literal_finder).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
The `string_literal_finder` package is designed to work across both Android and iOS platforms without requiring additional configurations. However, ensure that your Flutter environment is set up correctly for both platforms.

## Basic Usage
To use the `string_literal_finder` package, you can import it into your Dart files as follows:

```dart
import 'package:string_literal_finder/string_literal_finder.dart';
```

You can then utilize its features to extract, search, and manage string literals in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the package to find and replace string literals.

```dart
void main() {
  // Example usage of string_literal_finder
  String originalString = "Hello, World!";
  String newString = StringLiteralFinder.replace(originalString, "World", "Flutter");
  print(newString); // Output: Hello, Flutter!
}
```

This example demonstrates how to replace "World" with "Flutter" in a string literal. The package provides various methods to manipulate strings effectively.

# Complete Example of `string_literal_finder`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:string_literal_finder/string_literal_finder.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'String Literal Finder Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('String Literal Finder Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Original string to be manipulated
              String originalString = "Hello, World!";
              
              // Using string_literal_finder to replace "World" with "Flutter"
              String newString = StringLiteralFinder.replace(originalString, "World", "Flutter");
              
              // Displaying the result in a dialog
              showDialog(
                context: context,
                builder: (BuildContext context) {
                  return AlertDialog(
                    title: Text("String Replacement Result"),
                    content: Text(newString), // Output: Hello, Flutter!
                    actions: <Widget>[
                      TextButton(
                        child: Text("OK"),
                        onPressed: () {
                          Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                        },
                      ),
                    ],
                  );
                },
              );
            },
            child: Text('Replace String'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the original string "Hello, World!" is defined.
// 5. The string_literal_finder's replace method is called to replace "World" with "Flutter".
// 6. The result is displayed in an AlertDialog, showing "Hello, Flutter!".
// 7. The user can dismiss the dialog by pressing the "OK" button.
