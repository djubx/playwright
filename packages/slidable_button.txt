# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Slidable Button Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **slidable_button** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  slidable_button: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:slidable_button/slidable_button.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Slidable Button

You can now use the `SlidableButton` widget in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
SlidableButton(
  onChanged: (value) {
    if (value) {
      // Action to perform when the button is slid to the end
      print("Button Slid!");
    }
  },
  child: Text("Slide to Confirm"),
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

#### iOS

For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Customizing the Button

You can customize the appearance of the button by using various properties:

```dart
SlidableButton(
  onChanged: (value) {
    if (value) {
      print("Button Slid!");
    }
  },
  child: Text("Slide to Confirm"),
  buttonColor: Colors.blue,
  buttonTextColor: Colors.white,
  buttonWidth: 200,
)
```

This customization allows you to change the button's color, text color, and width to fit your app's design.

# Complete Example of Slidable Button

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:slidable_button/slidable_button.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Slidable Button Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Slidable Button Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: SlidableButton(
            onChanged: (value) {
              if (value) {
                // Action to perform when the button is slid to the end
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text("Button Slid!")),
                );
              }
            },
            child: Text("Slide to Confirm"),
            buttonColor: Colors.blue,
            buttonTextColor: Colors.white,
            buttonWidth: 200,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Slidable Button Demo".
// 4. In the body of the Scaffold, a SlidableButton widget is centered on the screen.
// 5. The SlidableButton has an onChanged callback that triggers when the button is slid.
// 6. If the button is slid to the end, a SnackBar is displayed at the bottom of the screen with the message "Button Slid!".
// 7. The button is styled with a blue background and white text, and its width is set to 200 pixels.
```
