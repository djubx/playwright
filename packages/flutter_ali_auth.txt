```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_ali_auth: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<manifest>
    <application>
        ...
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.alipay.sdk.app.AuthService"
            android:value="YOUR_ALIPAY_APP_ID" />
    </application>
</manifest>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following:

```xml
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
    <dict>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
        <array>
            <string>YOUR_ALIPAY_APP_ID</string>
        </array>
    </dict>
</array>
```

2. Ensure you have the necessary permissions in your `Info.plist`:

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_ali_auth/flutter_ali_auth.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Alibaba Auth Example',
      home: AuthHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class AuthHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _AuthHomePageState createState() => _AuthHomePageState();
}

class _AuthHomePageState extends State<AuthHomePage> {
  String _authResult = "Not Authenticated";

  // Function to handle Alibaba authentication
  Future<void> _authenticate() async {
    try {
      // Initiating the authentication process
      final result = await FlutterAliAuth.auth();
      setState(() {
        // Updating the UI with the authentication result
        _authResult = result;
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Handling any errors during authentication
      setState(() {
        _authResult = "Authentication Failed: $e";
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Alibaba Authentication'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(_authResult), // Displaying the authentication result
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _authenticate, // Triggering authentication on button press
              child: Text('Login with Alibaba'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and home page set to AuthHomePage.
// 3. AuthHomePage is a stateful widget that manages the authentication state.
// 4. The _authenticate function is called when the user presses the login button.
// 5. Inside _authenticate, the FlutterAliAuth.auth() method is called to initiate the login process.
// 6. If successful, the authentication result is displayed; if it fails, an error message is shown.
```
