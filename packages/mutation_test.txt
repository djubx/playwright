# Overview of the `mutation_test` Flutter Package

The `mutation_test` package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers to enhance their testing strategy by introducing mutation testing. Mutation testing is a method of software testing where certain parts of the code are altered (mutated) to ensure that the existing test cases can detect these changes. This helps in identifying the robustness of the test suite and ensures that the code is well-tested.

## When to Use `mutation_test`

- **Enhancing Test Coverage**: Use this package when you want to ensure that your test cases cover all possible scenarios and edge cases.
- **Improving Code Quality**: It helps in identifying weak spots in your test cases, prompting you to write more comprehensive tests.
- **Continuous Integration**: Integrate mutation testing into your CI/CD pipeline to maintain high code quality standards.

## Features

- **Automated Mutation Generation**: Automatically generates mutations in your code to test the effectiveness of your test cases.
- **Detailed Reports**: Provides comprehensive reports on which mutations were detected by your tests and which were not.
- **Customizable**: Allows customization of mutation strategies to fit your specific testing needs.

# Setting Up and Using the `mutation_test` Package

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `mutation_test` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter project.

## Setup Process

### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the `mutation_test` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

dev_dependencies:
  mutation_test: ^1.0.0
```

### Step 2: Install the Package

Run the following command to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Step 3: Configure for Android and iOS

#### Android

Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

#### iOS

Make sure your iOS deployment target is set to 11.0 or higher in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '11.0'
```

### Step 4: Initialize Mutation Testing

Create a configuration file `mutation_test.yaml` in the root of your project:

```yaml
# mutation_test.yaml
mutations:
  - type: arithmetic
  - type: conditional
  - type: logical
```

## Using the Package

To run mutation tests, use the following command:

```bash
flutter pub run mutation_test
```

This command will execute your test suite against the mutated versions of your code and provide a report on the effectiveness of your tests.

# Complete Example of Using `mutation_test` in a Flutter Application

Below is a complete example of a Flutter application using the `mutation_test` package. This example demonstrates the key features of the package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

// Main class of the application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Mutation Test Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MutationTestHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

// Home page of the application
class MutationTestHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MutationTestHomePageState createState() => _MutationTestHomePageState();
}

class _MutationTestHomePageState extends State<MutationTestHomePage> {
  int _counter = 0;

  // Method to increment the counter
  void _incrementCounter() {
    setState(() {
      _counter++;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Mutation Test Home Page'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'You have pushed the button this many times:',
            ),
            Text(
              '$_counter',
              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headlineMedium,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: _incrementCounter,
        tooltip: 'Increment',
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation
// The RealFlutter class is the main entry point of the application, setting up the MaterialApp.
// The MutationTestHomePage is a stateful widget that maintains the state of the counter.
// The _incrementCounter method updates the counter state, which triggers a UI rebuild.
// The build method of _MutationTestHomePageState constructs the UI, displaying the counter value.
// A FloatingActionButton is used to call _incrementCounter when pressed, demonstrating a simple state change.
