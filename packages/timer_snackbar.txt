# Timer Snackbar Flutter Package

The `timer_snackbar` Flutter package is a powerful tool for developers looking to enhance user experience by providing timed notifications in the form of snackbars.

- **Form Submissions**: Notify users when a form has been successfully submitted or if there was an error.
- **Background Processes**: Inform users about the completion of background tasks, such as file uploads or downloads.
- **User Actions**: Provide feedback after user actions, like saving settings or deleting items.

## Features

- **Customizable Duration**: Set how long the snackbar should be displayed.
- **Action Buttons**: Include action buttons for user interaction.
- **Flexible Design**: Customize the appearance to match your app's theme.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Timer Snackbar

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `timer_snackbar` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  timer_snackbar: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:timer_snackbar/timer_snackbar.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

To use the `timer_snackbar`, you need to call it from a `BuildContext`. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to show a snackbar:

```dart
void showTimerSnackbar(BuildContext context) {
  TimerSnackbar.show(
    context,
    message: 'This is a timed snackbar!',
    duration: Duration(seconds: 3), // Duration for which the snackbar will be visible
    action: SnackBarAction(
      label: 'Undo',
      onPressed: () {
        // Handle the action
      },
    ),
  );
}
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Testing the Snackbar

You can test the snackbar by calling the `showTimerSnackbar` function in response to a button press or any other user action.

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () => showTimerSnackbar(context),
  child: Text('Show Snackbar'),
)
```

With these steps, you can easily integrate the `timer_snackbar` package into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Timer Snackbar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:timer_snackbar/timer_snackbar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Timer Snackbar Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Timer Snackbar Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () => showTimerSnackbar(context), // Show snackbar on button press
            child: Text('Show Snackbar'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to show the timer snackbar
  void showTimerSnackbar(BuildContext context) {
    TimerSnackbar.show(
      context,
      message: 'This is a timed snackbar!', // Message to display
      duration: Duration(seconds: 3), // Duration for which the snackbar will be visible
      action: SnackBarAction(
        label: 'Undo', // Action button label
        onPressed: () {
          // Handle the action when the button is pressed
          print('Undo action pressed');
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'Timer Snackbar Demo'.
// 4. The body contains a Center widget with an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the showTimerSnackbar function is called.
// 6. The showTimerSnackbar function displays a snackbar with a message and an action button.
// 7. The snackbar is visible for 3 seconds, after which it disappears automatically.
// 8. If the action button is pressed, it prints 'Undo action pressed' to the console.
```
