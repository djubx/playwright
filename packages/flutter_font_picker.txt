# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `flutter_font_picker`

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_font_picker` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_font_picker` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_font_picker: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_font_picker/flutter_font_picker.dart';
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    compileSdkVersion 31 // or the latest version
    ...
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file to support custom fonts:

```xml
<key>UIAppFonts</key>
<array>
    <string>YourCustomFont.ttf</string>
</array>
```

## Step 4: Using the Font Picker

You can now use the `FontPicker` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_font_picker/flutter_font_picker.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String selectedFont = 'Roboto'; // Default font

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Font Picker Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the selected font
            Text(
              'Sample Text',
              style: TextStyle(fontFamily: selectedFont, fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to open the font picker
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Open the font picker dialog
                showDialog(
                  context: context,
                  builder: (context) {
                    return FontPicker(
                      onFontChanged: (font) {
                        setState(() {
                          selectedFont = font; // Update the selected font
                        });
                        Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                      },
                    );
                  },
                );
              },
              child: Text('Pick a Font'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that allows users to pick a font. The selected font is displayed in a `Text` widget.

# Complete Example of `flutter_font_picker`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_font_picker/flutter_font_picker.dart';

// Main entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// The main application widget
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Font Picker Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(), // Set the home to our RealFlutter widget
    );
  }
}

// The RealFlutter widget that contains the font picker functionality
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String selectedFont = 'Roboto'; // Default font

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Font Picker Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the sample text with the selected font
            Text(
              'Sample Text',
              style: TextStyle(fontFamily: selectedFont, fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to open the font picker dialog
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Open the font picker dialog
                showDialog(
                  context: context,
                  builder: (context) {
                    return FontPicker(
                      onFontChanged: (font) {
                        setState(() {
                          selectedFont = font; // Update the selected font
                        });
                        Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                      },
                    );
                  },
                );
              },
              child: Text('Pick a Font'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home as RealFlutter.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains the selected font state.
// 4. The build method displays a sample text with the currently selected font and a button to open the font picker.
// 5. When the button is pressed, a dialog with the FontPicker is shown.
// 6. The user can select a font, which updates the selectedFont state and refreshes the displayed text.
```
