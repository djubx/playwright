# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Tag Highlight Text Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `tag_highlight_text` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  tag_highlight_text: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `tag_highlight_text` package in your app.

# Complete Example of Using Tag Highlight Text

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tag_highlight_text/tag_highlight_text.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Tag Highlight Text Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Tag Highlight Text Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: HighlightedTextExample(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class HighlightedTextExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Define the text to be highlighted
    String text = "Flutter is an open-source UI software development toolkit created by Google.";
    
    // Define the tags to highlight
    List<String> tags = ["Flutter", "Google"];
    
    // Create a list of highlighted text segments
    List<HighlightText> highlightTexts = tags.map((tag) {
      return HighlightText(
        text: tag,
        style: TextStyle(
          backgroundColor: Colors.yellow, // Highlight color
          fontWeight: FontWeight.bold, // Bold text
        ),
      );
    }).toList();

    return TagHighlightText(
      text: text,
      highlightTexts: highlightTexts,
      style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20), // Default text style
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a centered body.
// 3. The HighlightedTextExample widget is created, which contains the text to be highlighted.
// 4. The tags to highlight are defined in a list, and each tag is mapped to a HighlightText object with custom styles.
// 5. The TagHighlightText widget is used to display the text with the specified highlights, making the tags stand out visually.
```
