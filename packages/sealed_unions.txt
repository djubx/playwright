In summary, the code flows as follows:

*   The app starts with a loading state, represented by a `CircularProgressIndicator`.
*   When the user presses the "Change Union" button, the state changes to a success state.
*   The success state is represented by a `Text` widget displaying the text "Success".
*   The app uses pattern matching to handle different cases (success, error, loading).
*   The app uses the Sealed Unions package to define and work with union types in a type-safe manner.
