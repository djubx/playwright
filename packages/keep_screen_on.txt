Here’s a detailed technical blog on the "keep_screen_on" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Keep Screen On Flutter Package

The `keep_screen_on` Flutter package is a simple yet powerful tool that allows developers to prevent the device's screen from dimming or turning off while an application is in use. This is particularly useful in scenarios where continuous user interaction is expected, such as during presentations, video playback, or when displaying real-time data.

## When to Use This Package

You might want to use the `keep_screen_on` package in the following scenarios:

- **Presentations**: When displaying slides or information that requires the user's attention without interruptions.
- **Video Players**: To keep the screen active while a video is playing, ensuring that the user does not have to touch the screen to keep it awake.
- **Real-time Data Display**: In applications that show live data, such as stock tickers or dashboards, where the user needs to see updates without the screen timing out.

## Features

- **Simple API**: The package provides an easy-to-use API to manage screen timeout settings.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices.
- **Customizable**: Allows developers to enable or disable the screen timeout as needed.

In summary, the `keep_screen_on` package is an essential tool for any Flutter developer looking to enhance user experience by keeping the screen active during critical interactions.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Keep Screen On Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `keep_screen_on` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  keep_screen_on: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, you need to ensure that your app has the necessary permissions. Open the `AndroidManifest.xml` file located in `android/app/src/main/` and add the following permission:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK"/>
```

### iOS

For iOS, no additional configuration is required. The package works out of the box.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Here’s how to implement it:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:keep_screen_on/keep_screen_on.dart';
```

2. Use the `KeepScreenOn` class to manage the screen state. You can enable or disable the screen timeout as needed.

### Example Usage

You can enable the screen to stay on when a specific widget is active, and disable it when the widget is no longer in use.

```dart
// Enable screen stay on
KeepScreenOn.turnOn();

// Disable screen stay on
KeepScreenOn.turnOff();
```

With these steps, you are now ready to use the `keep_screen_on` package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Using Keep Screen On

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:keep_screen_on/keep_screen_on.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to track if the screen should stay on
  bool _isScreenOn = false;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initially, we want the screen to stay on
    KeepScreenOn.turnOn();
    _isScreenOn = true;
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // When the widget is disposed, turn off the screen stay on
    KeepScreenOn.turnOff();
    super.dispose();
  }

  void _toggleScreenOn() {
    // Toggle the screen on/off state
    if (_isScreenOn) {
      KeepScreenOn.turnOff(); // Disable screen stay on
    } else {
      KeepScreenOn.turnOn(); // Enable screen stay on
    }
    setState(() {
      _isScreenOn = !_isScreenOn; // Update the state
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Keep Screen On Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text(
                _isScreenOn ? 'Screen is ON' : 'Screen is OFF',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _toggleScreenOn,
                child: Text(_isScreenOn ? 'Turn Screen OFF' : 'Turn Screen ON'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget, we maintain a state variable `_isScreenOn` to track if the screen should stay on.
// 3. In the `initState` method, we call `KeepScreenOn.turnOn()` to keep the screen active when the app starts.
// 4. The `dispose` method ensures that when the widget is removed from the widget tree, the screen timeout is restored by calling `KeepScreenOn.turnOff()`.
// 5. The `_toggleScreenOn` method toggles the screen state between on and off, updating the UI accordingly.
// 6. The UI consists of a text widget displaying the current state and a button to toggle the screen state.
```
