              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons

                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),

              Icon(
                CurrencyIcons.dollar,
                size: 50, // Setting the size of the icon

              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Currency Icons Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Column widget.
// 5. Inside the Column, we display text for prices followed by the corresponding currency icons.
// 6. The Euro icon is displayed first, followed by the US Dollar icon, each with customized sizes and colors.
// 7. The app showcases how to integrate and display currency icons effectively.
