# Description

The `package_rename` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to simplify the process of renaming your Flutter application package. This package is particularly useful when you want to change the package name of your app for various reasons, such as rebranding, creating a new version of an app, or simply organizing your projects better.

## When to Use

You might consider using the `package_rename` package in the following scenarios:

- **Rebranding**: If you are changing the branding of your app, you may need to change the package name to reflect the new brand.
- **Creating Variants**: When you want to create different variants of your app (e.g., free vs. paid), changing the package name can help distinguish them.
- **Organizational Purposes**: If you are restructuring your projects, renaming packages can help maintain clarity and organization.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: The package supports both Android and iOS platforms, making it versatile for Flutter developers.
- **Easy Configuration**: It provides a straightforward API to rename your package without manually editing files.
- **Backup and Restore**: The package can create backups of your original configuration, allowing you to restore if needed.

# Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `package_rename` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter project.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `package_rename` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  package_rename: ^2.0.0
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Setting Up for Android

For Android, you need to ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file is configured correctly. The `applicationId` should match your new package name. Here’s how to do it:

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Locate the `applicationId` line and change it to your new package name.

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        applicationId "com.example.newpackage" // Change this to your new package name
        ...
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Setting Up for iOS

For iOS, you need to update the `Info.plist` file:

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Change the `CFBundleIdentifier` to your new package name.

```xml
<key>CFBundleIdentifier</key>
<string>com.example.newpackage</string> <!-- Change this to your new package name -->
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Here’s a simple example of how to rename your package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:package_rename/package_rename.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Package Rename Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Package Rename Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Call the rename function
              await PackageRename.rename(
                newPackageName: 'com.example.newpackage',
              );
            },
            child: Text('Rename Package'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, the package will be renamed to `com.example.newpackage`.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:package_rename/package_rename.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Package Rename Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Package Rename Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Call the rename function
              await PackageRename.rename(
                newPackageName: 'com.example.newpackage',
              );
            },
            child: Text('Rename Package'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Package Rename Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold has a Center widget that centers its child, which is an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, it triggers the onPressed callback.
// 6. Inside the callback, the PackageRename.rename() method is called with the new package name.
// 7. This method will handle the renaming process for both Android and iOS platforms, updating the necessary files.
