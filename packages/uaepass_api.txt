# Setting Up and Using the uaepass_api Package

## Installation
To get started with the `uaepass_api` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  uaepass_api: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/uaepass_api).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure you have the following configurations:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:
   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. Ensure you have the correct deployment target set in your `ios/Podfile`:
   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

## Using the Package
Once you have installed the package and configured your project, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to authenticate a user using UAE Pass.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:uaepass_api/uaepass_api.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('UAE Pass Authentication')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initialize the UAE Pass API
              final uaepass = UaepassApi();

              // Start the authentication process
              try {
                final result = await uaepass.authenticate();
                // Handle successful authentication
                print('User authenticated: ${result.userId}');
              } catch (e) {
                // Handle authentication error
                print('Authentication failed: $e');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Login with UAE Pass'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of uaepass_api in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:uaepass_api/uaepass_api.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('UAE Pass Authentication')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initialize the UAE Pass API
              final uaepass = UaepassApi();

              // Start the authentication process
              try {
                final result = await uaepass.authenticate();
                // Handle successful authentication
                print('User authenticated: ${result.userId}');
              } catch (e) {
                // Handle authentication error
                print('Authentication failed: $e');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Login with UAE Pass'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which builds a MaterialApp.
// 2. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. The Center widget contains an ElevatedButton that triggers the authentication process when pressed.
// 4. Upon pressing the button, an instance of UaepassApi is created.
// 5. The authenticate method is called, which initiates the authentication process with UAE Pass.
// 6. If successful, the user ID is printed to the console; if it fails, an error message is printed.
