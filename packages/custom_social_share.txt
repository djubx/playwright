# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Custom Social Share

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `custom_social_share` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  custom_social_share: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

2. Ensure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to share images.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to save images to your photo library.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to share text and images.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:custom_social_share/custom_social_share.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Custom Social Share Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Share text and image
              CustomSocialShare.shareToFacebook(
                text: 'Check out this amazing app!',
                imagePath: 'path/to/image.png', // Provide a valid image path
              );
            },
            child: Text('Share on Facebook'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app with a button that shares a message on Facebook when pressed. You can replace `shareToFacebook` with other methods provided by the package to share on different platforms.

### Summary

# Complete Example of Custom Social Share

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:custom_social_share/custom_social_share.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Custom Social Share Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Share text on Facebook
                  CustomSocialShare.shareToFacebook(
                    text: 'Check out this amazing app!',
                    imagePath: 'path/to/image.png', // Provide a valid image path
                  );
                },
                child: Text('Share on Facebook'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Share text on Twitter
                  CustomSocialShare.shareToTwitter(
                    text: 'This is a tweet from my app!',
                  );
                },
                child: Text('Share on Twitter'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Share text and URL on WhatsApp
                  CustomSocialShare.shareToWhatsApp(
                    text: 'Check this out!',
                    url: 'https://example.com',
                  );
                },
                child: Text('Share on WhatsApp'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, we have a Column that holds three ElevatedButtons for sharing on Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp.
// 4. Each button has an onPressed callback that triggers the respective sharing method from the custom_social_share package.
// 5. When a button is pressed, the corresponding share method is called, allowing the user to share text, images, or URLs on the selected social media platform.
