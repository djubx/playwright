# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Televerse

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the Televerse package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding Televerse to Your Project

To get started, you need to add the Televerse package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  televerse: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. Ensure that your deployment target is set to at least iOS 10.0 in `ios/Podfile`:

   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

## Step 3: Using Televerse in Your Application

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to initialize and use the Televerse package.

# Complete Example: Using Televerse in a Flutter App

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:televerse/televerse.dart'; // Import the Televerse package

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp()); // Run the main application
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Televerse Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: TeleverseHome(), // Set the home widget
    );
  }
}

class TeleverseHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _TeleverseHomeState createState() => _TeleverseHomeState();
}

class _TeleverseHomeState extends State<TeleverseHome> {
  late Televerse televerse; // Declare a Televerse instance
  String message = ''; // Variable to hold the message

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    televerse = Televerse(); // Initialize Televerse
    televerse.connect(); // Connect to the Televerse server
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    televerse.disconnect(); // Disconnect when the widget is disposed
    super.dispose();
  }

  void sendMessage() {
    televerse.sendMessage('Hello, Televerse!'); // Send a message
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Televerse Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Message: $message', // Display the message
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                sendMessage(); // Call sendMessage on button press
              },
              child: Text('Send Message'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home widget is set to TeleverseHome.
// 4. In TeleverseHome, we initialize the Televerse instance and connect to the server in initState.
// 5. When the user presses the "Send Message" button, the sendMessage function is called, which sends a message through Televerse.
// 6. The message is displayed on the screen, and the connection is properly managed in the lifecycle methods.
```
