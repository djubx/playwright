# Flame Lottie: A Flutter Package for Lottie Animations

## Overview

The **flame_lottie** package is a powerful tool for integrating Lottie animations into Flutter applications. Lottie is an open-source animation file format that's lightweight and easy to use, allowing developers to create complex animations without the overhead of traditional animation techniques. The **flame_lottie** package combines the capabilities of Lottie with the Flame game engine, enabling developers to create interactive and visually appealing animations in their Flutter apps.

### When to Use Flame Lottie

- **Game Development**: When building games using the Flame engine, you can enhance the visual experience with Lottie animations for characters, backgrounds, or UI elements.
- **Interactive Applications**: For apps that require engaging animations, such as onboarding screens or interactive tutorials, **flame_lottie** can provide smooth and responsive animations.
- **Prototyping**: Quickly prototype animations for UI/UX designs without needing to create them from scratch.

### Features

- **Seamless Integration**: Easily integrate Lottie animations into your Flame game or Flutter application.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Designed to work efficiently with the Flame engine, ensuring smooth performance even with complex animations.
- **Customizability**: Modify animations dynamically based on user interactions or game states.

## Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Flame Lottie

### Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started with **flame_lottie**, add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flame: ^1.0.0
  flame_lottie: ^0.1.0
```

### Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

#### iOS

1. Open your `ios/Podfile`.
2. Uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

### Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the necessary packages:

```dart
import 'package:flame/flame.dart';
import 'package:flame_lottie/flame_lottie.dart';
```

### Step 4: Create Your Main Class

Create a class that extends `BaseGame` from the Flame engine. This will be your main game class where you can add Lottie animations.

```dart
class RealFlutter extends BaseGame {
  // Your game logic will go here
}
```

### Step 5: Load and Display Lottie Animation

You can load a Lottie animation using the `LottieComponent` class. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends BaseGame {
  late LottieComponent lottieComponent;

  RealFlutter() {
    // Load the Lottie animation from an asset
    lottieComponent = LottieComponent.fromAsset(
      'assets/animation.json',
      // Optional: Set the size of the animation
      size: Vector2(200, 200),
    );

    // Add the Lottie component to the game
    add(lottieComponent);
  }
}
```

### Step 6: Run Your Application

Finally, run your Flutter application to see the Lottie animation in action.

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(GameWidget(game: RealFlutter()));
}
```

## Complete Example: RealFlutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flame/game.dart'; // Import the Flame game package
import 'package:flame_lottie/flame_lottie.dart'; // Import the Flame Lottie package
import 'package:flutter/material.dart'; // Import Flutter material package

// Define the main game class
class RealFlutter extends BaseGame {
  late LottieComponent lottieComponent; // Declare a Lottie component

  RealFlutter() {
    // Load the Lottie animation from an asset
    lottieComponent = LottieComponent.fromAsset(
      'assets/animation.json', // Path to your Lottie animation file
      size: Vector2(200, 200), // Set the size of the animation
    );

    // Add the Lottie component to the game
    add(lottieComponent); // This makes the animation visible in the game
  }
}

// The main function to run the application
void main() {
  runApp(GameWidget(game: RealFlutter())); // Run the game widget with the RealFlutter game
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the GameWidget.
// 2. The GameWidget initializes the RealFlutter game class.
// 3. In the RealFlutter constructor, a LottieComponent is created from an asset.
// 4. The Lottie animation is added to the game, making it visible on the screen.
// 5. The animation will play automatically, and you can interact with it or modify it as needed.
```
