# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Media Kit Video

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **media_kit_video** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **media_kit_video** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  media_kit_video: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/media_kit_video).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions for internet access and media playback. Add the following lines inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file to allow access to the internet:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement video playback using the **media_kit_video** package.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:media_kit_video/media_kit_video.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Media Kit Video Example',
      home: VideoPlayerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class VideoPlayerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _VideoPlayerScreenState createState() => _VideoPlayerScreenState();
}

class _VideoPlayerScreenState extends State<VideoPlayerScreen> {
  late VideoPlayerController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the video controller with a video URL
    _controller = VideoPlayerController.network(
      'https://www.example.com/video.mp4',
    );
    // Start playing the video as soon as it's initialized
    _controller.initialize().then((_) {
      setState(() {});
      _controller.play();
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the controller when the widget is removed from the widget tree
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Video Player'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        // Display the video player
        child: _controller.value.isInitialized
            ? AspectRatio(
                aspectRatio: _controller.value.aspectRatio,
                child: VideoPlayer(_controller),
              )
            : CircularProgressIndicator(), // Show a loading indicator while the video is initializing
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          // Toggle play/pause when the button is pressed
          setState(() {
            _controller.value.isPlaying ? _controller.pause() : _controller.play();
          });
        },
        child: Icon(
          _controller.value.isPlaying ? Icons.pause : Icons.play_arrow,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation

// The main function initializes the app and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// The VideoPlayerScreen is a StatefulWidget that manages the video playback state.
// In the initState method, we initialize the VideoPlayerController with a video URL.
// Once the controller is initialized, we call setState to rebuild the widget and start playing the video.
// The build method checks if the video is initialized; if so, it displays the video player.
// If the video is not yet initialized, a CircularProgressIndicator is shown.
// A FloatingActionButton is provided to toggle play and pause functionality.
// When the button is pressed, we check the current state of the video and either pause or play it accordingly.
