# Lightbox Flutter Package

The **Lightbox** package for Flutter is a powerful tool that allows developers to create a modal image viewer with a smooth and elegant user experience. This package is particularly useful when you want to display images in a full-screen mode, allowing users to focus on the content without distractions. 

## When to Use

You might consider using the Lightbox package in scenarios such as:
- Displaying a gallery of images where users can tap to view larger versions.
- Presenting images in a detailed view from a list or grid layout.
- Creating a photo-sharing app where users can view images in a more immersive way.

## Features

- **Full-Screen Image Display**: Allows images to be viewed in full-screen mode.
- **Swipe Navigation**: Users can swipe left or right to navigate through images.
- **Zoom Functionality**: Users can pinch to zoom in and out of images.
- **Customizable UI**: You can customize the appearance and behavior of the lightbox to fit your app's design.

Overall, the Lightbox package enhances the user experience by providing a visually appealing way to view images in your Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Lightbox Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the Lightbox package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  lightbox: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable the `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` in your `Info.plist` file to allow access to the photo library:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to display images.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Lightbox Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the Lightbox functionality.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:lightbox/lightbox.dart';
```

2. Create a function to display the lightbox:

```dart
void showLightbox(BuildContext context, List<String> images, int index) {
  showDialog(
    context: context,
    builder: (context) {
      return Lightbox(
        images: images.map((image) => NetworkImage(image)).toList(),
        initialIndex: index,
      );
    },
  );
}
```

3. Call this function when an image is tapped in your app.

This setup allows you to display images in a lightbox format, providing a seamless experience for users.

# Complete Example of Using the Lightbox Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:lightbox/lightbox.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Lightbox Example',
      home: ImageGallery(),
    );
  }
}

class ImageGallery extends StatelessWidget {
  // List of image URLs to display
  final List<String> images = [
    'https://example.com/image1.jpg',
    'https://example.com/image2.jpg',
    'https://example.com/image3.jpg',
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Image Gallery'),
      ),
      body: GridView.builder(
        gridDelegate: SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount(
          crossAxisCount: 2, // Two images per row
        ),
        itemCount: images.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return GestureDetector(
            // When the image is tapped, show the lightbox
            onTap: () => showLightbox(context, images, index),
            child: Image.network(
              images[index],
              fit: BoxFit.cover, // Cover the entire grid cell
            ),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to show the lightbox
  void showLightbox(BuildContext context, List<String> images, int index) {
    showDialog(
      context: context,
      builder: (context) {
        return Lightbox(
          images: images.map((image) => NetworkImage(image)).toList(),
          initialIndex: index,
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets ImageGallery as the home.
// 3. ImageGallery contains a list of image URLs and displays them in a GridView.
// 4. Each image is wrapped in a GestureDetector to handle taps.
// 5. When an image is tapped, the showLightbox function is called, which opens the Lightbox dialog.
// 6. The Lightbox displays the tapped image in full-screen mode, allowing users to swipe through images.
```
