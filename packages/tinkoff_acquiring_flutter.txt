# Tutorial: Setting Up Tinkoff Acquiring Flutter Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **tinkoff_acquiring_flutter** package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  tinkoff_acquiring_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

3. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following entries to allow network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Initialize the Package
In your main Dart file, import the package and initialize it:

```dart
import 'package:tinkoff_acquiring_flutter/tinkoff_acquiring_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
  TinkoffAcquiringFlutter.initialize('YOUR_TERMINAL_KEY', 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY');
}
```

Replace `YOUR_TERMINAL_KEY` and `YOUR_SECRET_KEY` with your actual Tinkoff terminal credentials.

## Step 4: Implement Payment Flow
You can now implement the payment flow in your application. The package provides methods to initiate payments, handle callbacks, and manage transaction states.

For example, to initiate a payment, you can use:

```dart
final paymentResult = await TinkoffAcquiringFlutter.pay(
  amount: 1000, // Amount in kopecks
  orderId: 'order_12345',
  description: 'Payment for order 12345',
);
```

This method will handle the payment process and return the result.

By following these steps, you can successfully integrate the **tinkoff_acquiring_flutter** package into your Flutter application and start processing payments.

# Complete Example: Flutter Main File

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tinkoff_acquiring_flutter/tinkoff_acquiring_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
  // Initialize the Tinkoff Acquiring package with your terminal and secret keys
  TinkoffAcquiringFlutter.initialize('YOUR_TERMINAL_KEY', 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY');
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Tinkoff Acquiring Example',
      home: PaymentScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PaymentScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PaymentScreenState createState() => _PaymentScreenState();
}

class _PaymentScreenState extends State<PaymentScreen> {
  String _paymentResult = '';

  // Function to initiate payment
  Future<void> _initiatePayment() async {
    try {
      // Start the payment process
      final paymentResult = await TinkoffAcquiringFlutter.pay(
        amount: 1000, // Amount in kopecks
        orderId: 'order_12345',
        description: 'Payment for order 12345',
      );

      // Update the payment result state
      setState(() {
        _paymentResult = paymentResult.success ? 'Payment Successful' : 'Payment Failed';
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors during payment
      setState(() {
        _paymentResult = 'Error: $e';
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Tinkoff Payment Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Payment Result: $_paymentResult'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _initiatePayment,
              child: Text('Pay 10.00 RUB'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts by initializing the Tinkoff Acquiring package with the terminal and secret keys.
// 2. The main screen displays a button to initiate a payment of 10.00 RUB.
// 3. When the button is pressed, the _initiatePayment function is called.
// 4. This function attempts to process the payment using the Tinkoff API.
// 5. If the payment is successful, the result is displayed on the screen; otherwise, an error message is shown.
