# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Arabic Numbers Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `arabic_numbers` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  arabic_numbers: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to convert numbers to Arabic text.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:arabic_numbers/arabic_numbers.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Arabic Numbers Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(
            ArabicNumbers().convert(12345), // Converts 12345 to Arabic text
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we import the `arabic_numbers` package and use the `convert` method to transform the number `12345` into its Arabic text equivalent.

# Complete Example of Using the Arabic Numbers Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:arabic_numbers/arabic_numbers.dart';

// Main class of the application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Arabic Numbers Example'), // Title of the app
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Displaying the Arabic text for the number 12345
              Text(
                ArabicNumbers().convert(12345), // Converts 12345 to Arabic text
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between texts
              // Displaying the Arabic text for the number 67890
              Text(
                ArabicNumbers().convert(67890), // Converts 67890 to Arabic text
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the RealFlutter app
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
3. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to display two Text widgets.
4. Each Text widget calls the ArabicNumbers().convert() method to convert the specified integers (12345 and 67890) into their Arabic text representations.
5. The converted Arabic text is displayed in the center of the screen with a font size of 24.
6. The app provides a simple interface to demonstrate the functionality of the arabic_numbers package.
