# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `country_picker_bkb`

## Installation
To get started with the `country_picker_bkb` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  country_picker_bkb: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/country_picker_bkb).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `Info.plist` to ensure proper permissions for location services if your app uses them:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to provide better services.</string>
```

## Using the Package
To use the `country_picker_bkb` package, you can create a simple widget that utilizes the country picker. Below is a basic example of how to implement it in your Flutter application.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:country_picker_bkb/country_picker_bkb.dart';
```

2. Create a stateful widget to manage the selected country:

```dart
class CountryPickerExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CountryPickerExampleState createState() => _CountryPickerExampleState();
}

class _CountryPickerExampleState extends State<CountryPickerExample> {
  Country? selectedCountry;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Country Picker Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text(
              selectedCountry != null
                  ? 'Selected Country: ${selectedCountry!.name}'
                  : 'No Country Selected',
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                showCountryPicker(
                  context: context,
                  onSelect: (Country country) {
                    setState(() {
                      selectedCountry = country;
                    });
                  },
                );
              },
              child: Text('Select Country'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a simple UI with a button to open the country picker and display the selected country.

# Complete Example of `country_picker_bkb`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:country_picker_bkb/country_picker_bkb.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Country Picker Example',
      home: CountryPickerExample(),
    );
  }
}

class CountryPickerExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CountryPickerExampleState createState() => _CountryPickerExampleState();
}

class _CountryPickerExampleState extends State<CountryPickerExample> {
  Country? selectedCountry; // Variable to hold the selected country

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Country Picker Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the selected country or a default message
            Text(
              selectedCountry != null
                  ? 'Selected Country: ${selectedCountry!.name}'
                  : 'No Country Selected',
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Show the country picker when the button is pressed
                showCountryPicker(
                  context: context,
                  onSelect: (Country country) {
                    // Update the selected country when a country is picked
                    setState(() {
                      selectedCountry = country;
                    });
                  },
                );
              },
              child: Text('Select Country'), // Button text
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up a MaterialApp with a title and home widget.
// 3. The CountryPickerExample widget is displayed, which contains a stateful widget.
// 4. The stateful widget maintains the selected country state.
// 5. When the user presses the "Select Country" button, the country picker dialog appears.
// 6. Upon selecting a country, the selected country is updated and displayed on the screen.
