# Blurbox Flutter Package

The **Blurbox** package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to create visually appealing applications with blurred backgrounds. This package allows you to easily implement a blur effect on any widget, enhancing the user interface and providing a modern look to your applications.

## When to Use Blurbox

You might consider using the Blurbox package in scenarios such as:
- **Overlay Effects**: When you want to create a modal or overlay that stands out against the background.
- **Image Galleries**: To blur the background while focusing on images or content in the foreground.
- **Custom Dialogs**: When designing custom dialogs that require a blurred background for better aesthetics.

## Features

- **Customizable Blur Radius**: Adjust the intensity of the blur effect to suit your design needs.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate into existing Flutter applications with minimal setup.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

With these features, Blurbox can significantly enhance the visual appeal of your Flutter applications, making them more engaging for users.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Blurbox

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the Blurbox package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  blurbox: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable the following in your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file to allow for proper rendering of the blur effect:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>audio</string>
    <string>fetch</string>
</array>
```

## Step 3: Using Blurbox in Your Application

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement Blurbox:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:blurbox/blurbox.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Blurbox Example')),
        body: Stack(
          children: [
            // Background Image
            Image.network(
              'https://example.com/background.jpg',
              fit: BoxFit.cover,
              height: double.infinity,
              width: double.infinity,
            ),
            // Blurbox Widget
            Blurbox(
              blur: 10.0, // Set the blur radius
              child: Center(
                child: Container(
                  padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
                  color: Colors.white.withOpacity(0.8), // Semi-transparent background
                  child: Text(
                    'Hello, Blurbox!',
                    style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
                  ),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that uses the Blurbox package to blur the background image while displaying a centered text.

# Complete Example of Blurbox in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:blurbox/blurbox.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Blurbox Example')),
        body: Stack(
          children: [
            // Background Image
            Image.network(
              'https://example.com/background.jpg', // Load a background image
              fit: BoxFit.cover, // Cover the entire screen
              height: double.infinity, // Ensure it takes full height
              width: double.infinity, // Ensure it takes full width
            ),
            // Blurbox Widget
            Blurbox(
              blur: 10.0, // Set the blur radius to 10.0
              child: Center(
                child: Container(
                  padding: EdgeInsets.all(20), // Add padding around the text
                  color: Colors.white.withOpacity(0.8), // Semi-transparent white background
                  child: Text(
                    'Hello, Blurbox!', // Text displayed on the blurred background
                    style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24), // Text style
                  ),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter application
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, a Stack widget is used to layer the background image and the Blurbox.
// 4. The background image is loaded from a URL and set to cover the entire screen.
// 5. The Blurbox widget is placed on top of the background image, applying a blur effect with a radius of 10.0.
// 6. Inside the Blurbox, a centered container is created with a semi-transparent white background and some padding.
// 7. Finally, the text "Hello, Blurbox!" is displayed in the center of the screen, creating a visually appealing effect.
