Here's a detailed technical blog on the "process_runner" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Description

The `process_runner` Flutter package is a powerful tool that allows developers to run external processes and commands directly from their Flutter applications. This package is particularly useful for applications that require interaction with system-level commands, such as executing scripts, running shell commands, or managing background tasks.

## When to Use

You might consider using the `process_runner` package in scenarios such as:
- **Running Shell Commands**: If your application needs to execute shell commands for tasks like file manipulation, network requests, or system monitoring.
- **Automating Tasks**: For applications that automate workflows, such as build scripts or deployment processes.
- **Interfacing with External Tools**: When your app needs to communicate with other command-line tools or scripts.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Asynchronous Execution**: Allows for non-blocking execution of commands, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- **Output Handling**: Captures standard output and error streams, enabling developers to handle command results effectively.
- **Customizable Environment**: Allows setting environment variables for the executed processes.

## Setup Process

To get started with the `process_runner` package, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `process_runner` package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     process_runner: ^latest_version
   ```

   Replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/process_runner).

2. **Install Packages**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions if you are executing commands that require them. For example, if you need to access the internet, add:

     ```xml
     <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
     ```

   - **iOS**: For iOS, ensure that you have the appropriate entitlements set up if your commands require special permissions.

## Using the Package

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the `process_runner` package in your Flutter application:

1. **Import the Package**:

   ```dart
   import 'package:process_runner/process_runner.dart';
   ```

2. **Create a Function to Run a Command**:

   ```dart
   Future<void> runCommand() async {
     // Create an instance of ProcessRunner
     final runner = ProcessRunner();

     // Run a command (e.g., 'echo Hello World')
     final result = await runner.run('echo', ['Hello World']);

     // Check the result
     if (result.exitCode == 0) {
       print('Output: ${result.stdout}');
     } else {
       print('Error: ${result.stderr}');
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Call the Function**: You can call this function from your main application logic, such as in a button press event.

By following these steps, you can effectively integrate the `process_runner` package into your Flutter application and start executing commands.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:process_runner/process_runner.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Process Runner Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Process Runner Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              runCommand(); // Call the function to run the command
            },
            child: Text('Run Command'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to run a command using the process_runner package
  Future<void> runCommand() async {
    // Create an instance of ProcessRunner
    final runner = ProcessRunner();

    // Run a command (e.g., 'echo Hello World')
    final result = await runner.run('echo', ['Hello World']);

    // Check the result
    if (result.exitCode == 0) {
      // If the command was successful, print the output
      print('Output: ${result.stdout}');
    } else {
      // If there was an error, print the error message
      print('Error: ${result.stderr}');
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a simple UI containing a button.
// 3. When the button is pressed, the runCommand function is called.
// 4. Inside runCommand, an instance of ProcessRunner is created.
// 5. The command 'echo Hello World' is executed asynchronously.
// 6. The output or error from the command is printed to the console based on the exit code.
