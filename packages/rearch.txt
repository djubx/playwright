# Understanding the `rearch` Flutter Package

The `rearch` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to simplify the architecture of Flutter applications by providing a structured approach to state management and navigation. It is particularly useful in large-scale applications where maintaining a clean and manageable codebase is crucial. The package emphasizes the separation of concerns, making it easier to manage complex state changes and navigation flows.

## When to Use `rearch`

- **Complex State Management**: If your application involves intricate state management across multiple widgets, `rearch` can help streamline the process.
- **Navigation**: For applications with complex navigation requirements, `rearch` provides a structured way to handle routes and transitions.
- **Scalability**: As your application grows, maintaining a clean architecture becomes challenging. `rearch` helps in keeping the codebase organized and scalable.

## Key Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Encourages a modular approach to building applications, making it easier to manage and scale.
- **State Management**: Provides tools to manage state efficiently across different parts of the application.
- **Navigation**: Simplifies navigation with a clear and consistent approach.
- **Testability**: Enhances the testability of your application by promoting separation of concerns.

# Setting Up and Using the `rearch` Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `rearch` package and demonstrate how to integrate it into a Flutter project. We will cover platform-specific configurations for both Android and iOS.

## Setup Process

1. **Add Dependency**

   First, add the `rearch` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     rearch: ^1.0.0
   ```

2. **Install the Package**

   Run the following command to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configurations**

   - **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

     ```gradle
     android {
         defaultConfig {
             minSdkVersion 21
         }
     }
     ```

   - **iOS**: Make sure your iOS deployment target is set to 10.0 or higher in your `ios/Podfile`:

     ```ruby
     platform :ios, '10.0'
     ```

## Using the `rearch` Package

To use `rearch`, you need to define your application's architecture using the `RealFlutter` class. This involves setting up your state management and navigation logic.

1. **Define State Management**

   Create a state management class that extends `RealFlutter` and define your state variables and methods.

2. **Setup Navigation**

   Use the navigation features provided by `rearch` to define your routes and transitions.

3. **Integrate into Your Application**

   Integrate the `RealFlutter` class into your main application file and use it to manage state and navigation.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:rearch/rearch.dart';

// Define the main class extending RealFlutter for state management and navigation
class RealFlutterApp extends RealFlutter {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Rearch Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

// HomeScreen widget demonstrating basic usage of rearch
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate to the details screen using rearch navigation
            Navigator.of(context).push(
              MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => DetailsScreen()),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Go to Details'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// DetailsScreen widget to demonstrate navigation
class DetailsScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Details Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate back to the home screen
            Navigator.of(context).pop();
          },
          child: Text('Back to Home'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutterApp());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the RealFlutterApp class, which extends RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutterApp builds a MaterialApp with a HomeScreen as the initial route.
// 3. HomeScreen displays a button that navigates to DetailsScreen when pressed.
// 4. DetailsScreen provides a button to navigate back to HomeScreen.
// 5. The navigation is handled using Flutter's Navigator, demonstrating basic routing with rearch.
