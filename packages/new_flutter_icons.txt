# Setting Up and Using new_flutter_icons

## Installation
To get started with the `new_flutter_icons` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  new_flutter_icons: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, make sure to enable the necessary permissions in your `Info.plist` if you are using any features that require them. However, for basic icon usage, no additional configuration is needed.

## Using the Package
To use the icons in your Flutter application, you can import the package and start using the icons in your widgets. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:new_flutter_icons/new_flutter_icons.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('New Flutter Icons Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Icon(
            NewFlutterIcons.home, // Using an icon from the package
            size: 50.0,
            color: Colors.blue,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to import the package and use an icon in a simple Flutter application.

}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {

  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'New Flutter Icons Demo', // Title of the application
      theme: ThemeData(

        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center, // Centering the column
            children: <Widget>[
              Icon(
                NewFlutterIcons.home, // Home icon from the package
                size: 100.0, // Size of the icon
                color: Colors.blue, // Color of the icon
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between icons
              Icon(
                NewFlutterIcons.settings, // Settings icon from the package
                size: 100.0, // Size of the icon
                color: Colors.green, // Color of the icon
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between icons
              Icon(
                NewFlutterIcons.user, // User icon from the package
                size: 100.0, // Size of the icon
                color: Colors.red, // Color of the icon
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Explanation of the application flow:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application, which calls runApp() with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a title and a theme.
// 4. The home property of the MaterialApp is a Scaffold, which provides the structure for the app.
// 5. The AppBar displays the title of the application.
// 6. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 7. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the icons vertically.
// 8. Each Icon widget uses an icon from the new_flutter_icons package, with specified size and color.
// 9. SizedBox is used to add space between the icons for better visual separation.
