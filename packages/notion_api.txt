# Notion API Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the `notion_api` package, add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  notion_api: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/notion_api).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21 // or higher
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add internet permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:
   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. Ensure your deployment target is set to at least iOS 11.0 in `ios/Podfile`.

## Basic Usage
To use the `notion_api` package, you need to authenticate and then perform operations. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to authenticate and fetch a page:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:notion_api/notion_api.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Notion API Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initialize Notion API
              final notion = NotionAPI(token: 'YOUR_NOTION_TOKEN');

              // Fetch a page
              final page = await notion.getPage('YOUR_PAGE_ID');
              print(page);
            },
            child: Text('Fetch Notion Page'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, replace `YOUR_NOTION_TOKEN` and `YOUR_PAGE_ID` with your actual Notion API token and the ID of the page you want to fetch.

This setup allows you to start interacting with Notion's API seamlessly.

# Complete Example of Notion API Integration

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:notion_api/notion_api.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Notion API Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initialize Notion API with your token
              final notion = NotionAPI(token: 'YOUR_NOTION_TOKEN');

              // Fetch a page using its ID
              final page = await notion.getPage('YOUR_PAGE_ID');

              // Display the page title
              showDialog(
                context: context,
                builder: (context) {
                  return AlertDialog(
                    title: Text('Notion Page Title'),
                    content: Text(page.title),
                    actions: [
                      TextButton(
                        onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                        child: Text('Close'),
                      ),
                    ],
                  );
                },
              );
            },
            child: Text('Fetch Notion Page'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with a MaterialApp widget that contains a Scaffold.
// 2. An AppBar is created with the title 'Notion API Example'.
// 3. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget with an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the NotionAPI is initialized with a token.
// 5. The app fetches a page from Notion using its ID.
// 6. Once the page is fetched, an AlertDialog is displayed showing the page title.
// 7. The user can close the dialog by pressing the 'Close' button.
```
