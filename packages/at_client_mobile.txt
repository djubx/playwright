<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Overview of the at_client_mobile Flutter Package

The `at_client_mobile` package is a powerful tool designed for building decentralized applications (dApps) using the At Protocol. It provides a seamless way to manage user identities, data storage, and communication in a secure and efficient manner. This package is particularly useful for developers looking to create applications that prioritize user privacy and data ownership.

## When to Use `at_client_mobile`

You should consider using the `at_client_mobile` package in scenarios such as:

- **Decentralized Applications**: When building applications that require user data to be stored and managed in a decentralized manner.
- **User Identity Management**: If your application needs to handle user identities securely and efficiently.
- **Real-time Communication**: For applications that require real-time data synchronization and communication between users.

## Key Features

- **User Identity Management**: Easily manage user identities with secure authentication mechanisms.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using at_client_mobile

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `at_client_mobile` package and demonstrate how to use its features effectively.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `at_client_mobile` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  at_client_mobile: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/at_client_mobile).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version
        ...
    }
}
```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. Ensure your iOS deployment target is set to at least 11.0 in `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '11.0'
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in our Flutter application.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:at_client_mobile/at_client_mobile.dart';
```

2. Initialize the AtClient:

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  AtClientService atClientService = AtClientService();
  await atClientService.init();
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

3. Use the AtClient to manage user data:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('AtClient Mobile Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Example of saving data
              var atClient = AtClientManager.getInstance().atClient;
              await atClient.put('key', 'value');
              // Example of retrieving data
              var value = await atClient.get('key');
              print('Retrieved value: $value');
            },
            child: Text('Save and Retrieve Data'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This basic setup allows you to save and retrieve data using the `at_client_mobile` package.

# Complete Example of at_client_mobile

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:at_client_mobile/at_client_mobile.dart';

void main() async {
  // Ensure Flutter binding is initialized
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  
  // Initialize AtClientService
  AtClientService atClientService = AtClientService();
  await atClientService.init(); // Initialize the AtClient
  
  // Run the Flutter application
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('AtClient Mobile Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Get the instance of AtClient
              var atClient = AtClientManager.getInstance().atClient;
              
              // Save data to the AtClient
              await atClient.put('key', 'value'); // Store a key-value pair
              
              // Retrieve data from the AtClient
              var value = await atClient.get('key'); // Get the value for the key
              print('Retrieved value: $value'); // Print the retrieved value
            },
            child: Text('Save and Retrieve Data'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter application and AtClientService.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds the UI with a button.
// 3. When the button is pressed, it saves a key-value pair to the AtClient.
// 4. It then retrieves the value associated with the key and prints it to the console.
```

## Summary

In this blog, we explored the `at_client_mobile` Flutter package, detailing its features and use cases. We walked through the setup process, including platform-specific configurations for Android and iOS. Finally, we provided a complete example demonstrating how to save and retrieve data using the package.

The application flow is straightforward: it initializes the AtClient, provides a button for saving and retrieving data, and prints the results to the console. This package is a robust solution for developers looking to build decentralized applications with a focus on user privacy and data ownership.
