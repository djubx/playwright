Here's a detailed technical blog on the "dartssh2" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Dartssh2 Flutter Package

The `dartssh2` package is a powerful library for establishing SSH connections in Flutter applications. It allows developers to execute commands on remote servers, transfer files, and manage SSH sessions seamlessly. This package is particularly useful for applications that require remote server management, automation tasks, or any functionality that involves SSH protocol.

## When to Use `dartssh2`

- **Remote Server Management**: If your application needs to manage servers remotely, such as executing scripts or commands, `dartssh2` is an excellent choice.
- **File Transfers**: The package supports SFTP, making it suitable for applications that require file uploads or downloads from remote servers.
- **Automation**: For applications that automate server tasks, such as backups or deployments, `dartssh2` provides the necessary tools to connect and execute commands.

## Features

- **SSH Client**: Establish secure connections to remote servers.
- **Command Execution**: Run shell commands on the remote server and retrieve the output.
- **SFTP Support**: Transfer files securely using the SFTP protocol.
- **Key Authentication**: Supports both password and key-based authentication for secure connections.

Overall, `dartssh2` is a versatile package that enhances Flutter applications with SSH capabilities, making it a valuable tool for developers working with remote servers.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Dartssh2

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `dartssh2` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `dartssh2` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dartssh2: ^0.2.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable the `NSAppTransportSecurity` settings in your `Info.plist` file to allow connections to non-secure servers:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to connect to an SSH server, execute a command, and retrieve the output.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:dartssh2/dartssh2.dart';
```

2. Create a function to establish an SSH connection and execute a command:

```dart
Future<void> executeCommand() async {
  // Create an SSH client
  final client = SSHClient(
    host: 'your.server.com',
    port: 22,
    username: 'your_username',
    passwordOrKey: 'your_password_or_key',
  );

  // Connect to the server
  await client.connect();

  // Execute a command
  final result = await client.execute('ls -la');

  // Print the result
  print(result);

  // Disconnect from the server
  await client.disconnect();
}
```

3. Call the `executeCommand` function from your main application logic.

This setup allows you to connect to an SSH server and execute commands securely. Make sure to handle exceptions and errors appropriately in a production application.

# Complete Example: Flutter Application Using Dartssh2

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dartssh2/dartssh2.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dartssh2 Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Dartssh2 Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              executeCommand(); // Call the function to execute the command
            },
            child: Text('Execute Command'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Function to execute a command on the remote server
Future<void> executeCommand() async {
  // Create an SSH client with server details
  final client = SSHClient(
    host: 'your.server.com', // Replace with your server's address
    port: 22, // Default SSH port
    username: 'your_username', // Replace with your username
    passwordOrKey: 'your_password_or_key', // Replace with your password or key
  );

  try {
    // Connect to the server
    await client.connect();
    print('Connected to the server.');

    // Execute a command and get the result
    final result = await client.execute('ls -la'); // List files in the directory
    print('Command output: $result'); // Print the command output

  } catch (e) {
    // Handle any errors that occur during the connection or command execution
    print('Error: $e');
  } finally {
    // Ensure the client is disconnected after the operation
    await client.disconnect();
    print('Disconnected from the server.');
  }
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts and displays a button labeled "Execute Command".
2. When the button is pressed, the `executeCommand` function is called.
3. Inside `executeCommand`, an SSH client is created with the server's details.
4. The client attempts to connect to the server.
5. If the connection is successful, a command (`ls -la`) is executed on the server.
6. The output of the command is printed to the console.
7. If any errors occur during the connection or command execution, they are caught and printed.
8. Finally, the client disconnects from the server, ensuring that resources are released.
