# Tutorial: Setting Up flutter_advanced_drawer

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_advanced_drawer` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_advanced_drawer` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_advanced_drawer: ^0.2.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install the Package

Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` file to allow for certain permissions if your drawer interacts with device features. However, for basic usage, no additional configuration is required.

## Step 4: Basic Usage

Now that we have set up the package, let's implement a basic example. The following code demonstrates how to create a simple application using the `flutter_advanced_drawer` package.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_advanced_drawer/flutter_advanced_drawer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Advanced Drawer Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  // Create an instance of AdvancedDrawerController
  final AdvancedDrawerController _controller = AdvancedDrawerController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return AdvancedDrawer(
      controller: _controller,
      backdropColor: Colors.blueGrey,
      drawer: DrawerWidget(),
      child: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Advanced Drawer Example'),
          leading: IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.menu),
            onPressed: () {
              // Toggle the drawer when the menu button is pressed
              _controller.showDrawer();
            },
          ),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Home Screen'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DrawerWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      width: 250,
      color: Colors.white,
      child: Column(
        children: [
          SizedBox(height: 50),
          ListTile(
            title: Text('Item 1'),
            onTap: () {
              // Handle item tap
            },
          ),
          ListTile(
            title: Text('Item 2'),
            onTap: () {
              // Handle item tap
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is set as the home of the MaterialApp.
// 4. Inside HomeScreen, an AdvancedDrawer is created with a controller.
// 5. The drawer is linked to a DrawerWidget that contains navigation items.
// 6. The AppBar has a menu button that toggles the drawer when pressed.
// 7. The DrawerWidget displays a simple list of items that can be tapped.
// 8. The application is structured to allow easy customization and expansion.
```
