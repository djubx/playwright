```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simple_heatmap_calendar/simple_heatmap_calendar.dart';

void main() => runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Heatmap Calendar Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HeatmapCalendarScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HeatmapCalendarScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample data for the heatmap
    final Map<DateTime, int> data = {
      DateTime(2023, 9, 1): 5,
      DateTime(2023, 9, 2): 10,
      DateTime(2023, 9, 3): 2,
      // Add more data points as needed
    };

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Heatmap Calendar'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: RealFlutter(
          data: data, // Pass the data to the heatmap
          colorThresholds: {
            1: Colors.green[100]!,
            5: Colors.green[300]!,
            10: Colors.green[500]!,
          }, // Define color thresholds
          onCellTap: (date, value) {
            // Handle cell tap event
            ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
              SnackBar(content: Text('Date: $date, Value: $value')),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// MyApp is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title, theme, and home screen.
// HeatmapCalendarScreen is the home screen widget that displays the heatmap calendar.
// The data map contains DateTime keys and integer values representing the data points for the heatmap.
// RealFlutter is the main widget from the simple_heatmap_calendar package that renders the heatmap.
// colorThresholds define the color intensity based on the data values.
// onCellTap is a callback function that shows a SnackBar with the date and value when a cell is tapped.
