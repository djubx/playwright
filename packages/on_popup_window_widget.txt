# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using on_popup_window_widget

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `on_popup_window_widget` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  on_popup_window_widget: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` file to allow for popups. Add the following key-value pair:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a popup window.

                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 10),
              Text('This is an example of a popup window in Flutter.'),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Close the popup when the button is pressed
                  Navigator.of(context).pop();
                },
                child: Text('Close Popup'), // Close button text
              ),
            ],
          ),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
// Explanation of the application flow:

// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is created. When this button is pressed, it triggers the showPopupWindow() function.
// 4. The showPopupWindow() function uses the showPopupWindowWidget() method from the on_popup_window_widget package to display a popup.
// 5. The popup contains a title, a message, and a button to close the popup. The popup is styled with padding, background color, and shadow.
// 6. When the "Close Popup" button is pressed, the Navigator pops the current route, closing the popup and returning to the main screen.
