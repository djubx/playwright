// This is the main entry point of the app.
// The app is initialized with the `MaterialApp` widget.
// The `MyHomePage` widget is the home page of the app.

// The `MyHomePage` widget is a stateful widget.
// It has a `_language` and `_translatedString` variable to store the current language and translated string.
// The `_initApplanga` function is called in the `initState` method to initialize Applanga and get the current language and translated string.

// The `build` method returns a `Scaffold` widget with an `AppBar` and a `Center` widget.
// The `Center` widget has a `Column` widget with two `Text` widgets to display the current language and translated string.

// The app uses the `ApplangaFlutter` package to manage its translations.
// The `ApplangaFlutter` package is initialized with the `appId` and `appSecret` in the `_initApplanga` function.
// The `getCurrentLanguage` and `getString` functions are used to get the current language and translated string.
