# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Telpo Flutter SDK

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **telpo_flutter_sdk** and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **telpo_flutter_sdk** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  telpo_flutter_sdk: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/telpo_flutter_sdk).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file and add the necessary permissions. For example, if you are using a barcode scanner, you might need:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure that your `build.gradle` file is set up correctly to include the Telpo SDK dependencies.

### iOS Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open your `Info.plist` file and add the required permissions. For example:

   ```xml
   <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to the camera for scanning barcodes.</string>
   ```

2. **Podfile**: Make sure your Podfile is configured to use the latest iOS version compatible with the Telpo SDK.

## Step 3: Using the SDK

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your Flutter application.

1. **Import the Package**:

   ```dart
   import 'package:telpo_flutter_sdk/telpo_flutter_sdk.dart';
   ```

2. **Initialize the SDK**:

   You need to initialize the SDK in your main application file:

   ```dart
   void main() {
     runApp(MyApp());
     TelpoFlutterSdk.initialize();
   }
   ```

3. **Using Key Features**:

   You can now use various features of the SDK, such as initiating a payment or scanning a barcode. Refer to the package documentation for specific methods and their usage.

This tutorial provides a foundational understanding of how to set up and use the **telpo_flutter_sdk** in your Flutter applications. For more advanced features and configurations, refer to the official documentation.

# Complete Example: A Flutter Application Using Telpo Flutter SDK

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:telpo_flutter_sdk/telpo_flutter_sdk.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
  // Initialize the Telpo SDK
  TelpoFlutterSdk.initialize();
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Telpo SDK Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  String _result = "Scan a barcode or initiate a payment";

  // Function to scan a barcode
  void _scanBarcode() async {
    try {
      // Start the barcode scanner
      String barcode = await TelpoFlutterSdk.scanBarcode();
      setState(() {
        _result = "Scanned Barcode: $barcode";
      });
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        _result = "Error scanning barcode: $e";
      });
    }
  }

  // Function to initiate a payment
  void _initiatePayment() async {
    try {
      // Start the payment process
      bool success = await TelpoFlutterSdk.initiatePayment(100.0); // Example amount
      setState(() {
        _result = success ? "Payment Successful" : "Payment Failed";
      });
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        _result = "Error initiating payment: $e";
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Telpo SDK Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(_result),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _scanBarcode,
              child: Text('Scan Barcode'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _initiatePayment,
              child: Text('Initiate Payment'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, initializing the Telpo SDK.
// 2. The MyApp widget is created, which sets up the MaterialApp and HomeScreen.
// 3. In HomeScreen, two buttons are provided: one for scanning a barcode and another for initiating a payment.
// 4. When the user taps the "Scan Barcode" button, the _scanBarcode function is called, which uses the Telpo SDK to scan a barcode and updates the UI with the result.
// 5. Similarly, tapping the "Initiate Payment" button calls the _initiatePayment function, which processes a payment and updates the UI based on the success or failure of the transaction.
```
