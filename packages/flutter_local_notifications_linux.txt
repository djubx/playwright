# Tutorial: Setting Up flutter_local_notifications_linux

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_local_notifications_linux` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_local_notifications_linux` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_local_notifications_linux: ^0.0.1
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the new dependency.

## Step 2: Configuring Linux-Specific Settings

For Linux applications, you need to ensure that your application has the necessary permissions to display notifications. This typically involves modifying the `CMakeLists.txt` file to include the required libraries.

1. Open your `CMakeLists.txt` file located in the `linux` directory of your Flutter project.
2. Add the following lines to link the necessary libraries:

```cmake
find_package(Gio REQUIRED)
find_package(Gdk REQUIRED)
find_package(GdkPixbuf REQUIRED)
find_package(GdkX11 REQUIRED)
find_package(Gio REQUIRED)
find_package(Gio-2.0 REQUIRED)
```

3. Ensure that your application has access to the notification service by adding the following to your `main.cpp`:

```cpp
#include <flutter/flutter_view_controller.h>
#include <flutter/method_channel.h>
#include <flutter/plugin_registrar.h>
#include <flutter/plugin_registry.h>
#include <flutter/standard_method_codec.h>
```

## Step 3: Initializing the Package

In your main Dart file, you need to initialize the `flutter_local_notifications_linux` package. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_local_notifications_linux/flutter_local_notifications_linux.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Local Notifications Demo',
      home: NotificationHome(),
    );
  }
}

class NotificationHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _NotificationHomeState createState() => _NotificationHomeState();
}

class _NotificationHomeState extends State<NotificationHome> {
  late FlutterLocalNotificationsLinux flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin = FlutterLocalNotificationsLinux();
    _initializeNotifications();
  }

  void _initializeNotifications() async {
    const AndroidInitializationSettings initializationSettingsAndroid =
        AndroidInitializationSettings('app_icon');

    const InitializationSettings initializationSettings =
        InitializationSettings(android: initializationSettingsAndroid);

    await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.initialize(initializationSettings);
  }
}
```

In this code, we initialize the `flutter_local_notifications_linux` plugin and set up the necessary settings for Android. You can customize the initialization settings based on your requirements.

## Step 4: Displaying Notifications

To display a notification, you can use the following method:

```dart
Future<void> _showNotification() async {
  const AndroidNotificationDetails androidPlatformChannelSpecifics =
      AndroidNotificationDetails(
          'your channel id', 'your channel name', 'your channel description',
          importance: Importance.max, priority: Priority.high);

  const NotificationDetails platformChannelSpecifics =
      NotificationDetails(android: androidPlatformChannelSpecifics);

  await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.show(
      0, 'Hello, World!', 'This is a local notification', platformChannelSpecifics,
      payload: 'item x');
}
```

This method creates a notification with a title and body, which can be triggered by calling `_showNotification()`.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can successfully set up and use the `flutter_local_notifications_linux` package in your Flutter application. This package provides a robust solution for managing local notifications on Linux, enhancing user engagement and experience.

# Complete Example of flutter_local_notifications_linux

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_local_notifications_linux/flutter_local_notifications_linux.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Local Notifications Demo',
      home: NotificationHome(),
    );
  }
}

class NotificationHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _NotificationHomeState createState() => _NotificationHomeState();
}

class _NotificationHomeState extends State<NotificationHome> {
  late FlutterLocalNotificationsLinux flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the local notifications plugin
    flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin = FlutterLocalNotificationsLinux();
    _initializeNotifications();
  }

  void _initializeNotifications() async {
    // Define Android-specific initialization settings
    const AndroidInitializationSettings initializationSettingsAndroid =
        AndroidInitializationSettings('app_icon');

    // Combine Android settings into general initialization settings
    const InitializationSettings initializationSettings =
        InitializationSettings(android: initializationSettingsAndroid);

    // Initialize the plugin with the settings
    await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.initialize(initializationSettings);
  }

  // Method to show a notification
  Future<void> _showNotification() async {
    // Define the Android-specific notification details
    const AndroidNotificationDetails androidPlatformChannelSpecifics =
        AndroidNotificationDetails(
            'your channel id', 'your channel name', 'your channel description',
            importance: Importance.max, priority: Priority.high);

    // Combine Android details into platform-specific notification details
    const NotificationDetails platformChannelSpecifics =
        NotificationDetails(android: androidPlatformChannelSpecifics);

    // Show the notification with a unique ID, title, and body
    await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.show(
        0, 'Hello, World!', 'This is a local notification', platformChannelSpecifics,
        payload: 'item x');
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Local Notifications Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _showNotification, // Trigger the notification on button press
          child: Text('Show Notification'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home page (NotificationHome).
// 3. The NotificationHome widget initializes the FlutterLocalNotificationsLinux plugin in its state.
// 4. The _initializeNotifications() method sets up the notification settings for Android.
// 5. When the user presses the "Show Notification" button, the _showNotification() method is called.
// 6. This method creates and displays a notification with a title and body, enhancing user engagement.
