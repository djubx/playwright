# Flutter HTML Math Package
================================

The `flutter_html_math` package is a powerful tool for rendering HTML content with mathematical expressions in Flutter applications. It provides a simple and efficient way to display complex mathematical equations and formulas in a beautiful and readable format.

## When to Use This Package
---------------------------

This package is ideal for applications that require rendering mathematical content, such as:

* Educational apps that teach mathematics and science
* Scientific and technical documentation
* Research papers and publications
* Math-based games and puzzles

## Features
------------

The `flutter_html_math` package offers the following features:

* Support for rendering HTML content with mathematical expressions
* Support for LaTeX and MathML syntax
* Customizable font sizes and styles
* Support for various mathematical symbols and operators

# Setting Up the Package
-------------------------

To use the `flutter_html_math` package, follow these steps:

1. Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  flutter_html_math: ^1.0.0
```
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.
3. Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:flutter_html_math/flutter_html_math.dart';
```
## Platform-Specific Details
---------------------------

### Android

No additional configuration is required for Android.

### iOS

To use the package on iOS, you need to add the following line to your `Info.plist` file:
```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
  <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
  <true/>
</dict>
```
This allows the app to load HTML content from the internet.

## Using the Package
---------------------

To use the package, create a `RealFlutter` widget and pass the HTML content to the `html` property:
```dart
RealFlutter(
  html: '<p>This is a mathematical expression: $x^2 + 3x - 4$</p>',
)
```
You can customize the font size and style using the `fontSize` and `fontStyle` properties:
```dart
RealFlutter(
  html: '<p>This is a mathematical expression: $x^2 + 3x - 4$</p>',
  fontSize: 24,
  fontStyle: FontStyle.italic,
)
```

<-- START_MAIN -->

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_html_math/flutter_html_math.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter HTML Math Demo',
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter HTML Math Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: RealFlutter(
          html: '<p>This is a mathematical expression: $x^2 + 3x - 4$</p>',
          fontSize: 24,
          fontStyle: FontStyle.italic,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a Material app with a title and a home page.
// 2. The home page is a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 3. The body is a Center widget that contains a RealFlutter widget.
// 4. The RealFlutter widget is passed the HTML content to render, which includes a mathematical expression.
// 5. The RealFlutter widget renders the HTML content using the flutter_html_math package.
// 6. The rendered content is displayed in the app, with the mathematical expression formatted correctly.
