# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_material_symbols

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `flutter_material_symbols` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_material_symbols: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_material_symbols).

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the package to start using it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_material_symbols/flutter_material_symbols.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Icons

You can now use the icons in your Flutter widgets. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use an icon:

```dart
Icon(
  MaterialSymbols.home,
  size: 24.0,
  color: Colors.blue,
)
```

This will render a home icon with a size of 24 pixels and a blue color.

With these steps, you are now ready to use the `flutter_material_symbols` package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of flutter_material_symbols

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_material_symbols/flutter_material_symbols.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Material Symbols Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Material Symbols Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Displaying a home icon from the Material Symbols package
            Icon(
              MaterialSymbols.home,
              size: 100.0, // Setting the size of the icon
              color: Colors.blue, // Setting the color of the icon
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between the icon and text
            Text(
              'Home Icon',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24), // Setting the text size
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 40), // Adding space before the next icon
            // Displaying a settings icon from the Material Symbols package
            Icon(
              MaterialSymbols.settings,
              size: 100.0, // Setting the size of the icon
              color: Colors.green, // Setting the color of the icon
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between the icon and text
            Text(
              'Settings Icon',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24), // Setting the text size
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to HomePage, which is the main screen of the app.
// 4. In HomePage, a Scaffold widget is used to create the basic visual structure.
// 5. The AppBar displays the title of the app.
// 6. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child widgets.
// 7. A Column widget is used to arrange the icons and text vertically.
// 8. Two icons (home and settings) from the Material Symbols package are displayed with corresponding text labels.
// 9. SizedBox widgets are used to add spacing between the icons and text for better visual separation.
