Maths Flutter Package: A Comprehensive Overview
=====================================================

The "maths" Flutter package is a powerful library that provides a wide range of mathematical functions and utilities for Flutter developers. It includes features such as vector math, matrix operations, and statistical analysis, making it an essential tool for any Flutter project that requires complex mathematical calculations.

When to Use the Maths Package
-----------------------------

The maths package is perfect for Flutter projects that require:

* Complex mathematical calculations, such as 3D graphics rendering or scientific simulations
* Vector math and matrix operations, such as game development or computer vision
* Statistical analysis, such as data analysis or machine learning

Features of the Maths Package
-----------------------------

The maths package includes a wide range of features, including:

* Vector math: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of vectors
* Matrix operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and inversion of matrices
* Statistical analysis: mean, median, mode, and standard deviation of datasets
* Trigonometric functions: sine, cosine, and tangent of angles

Setting Up the Maths Package
-----------------------------

To use the maths package in your Flutter project, follow these steps:

1. Add the maths package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  maths: ^1.0.0
```
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install the package
3. Import the maths package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:maths/maths.dart';
```
Using the Maths Package
------------------------

The maths package provides a wide range of functions and utilities for performing mathematical calculations. Here are a few examples:

* Vector math:
```dart
Vector3 v1 = Vector3(1, 2, 3);
Vector3 v2 = Vector3(4, 5, 6);
Vector3 result = v1 + v2;
print(result); // prints Vector3(5, 7, 9)
```
* Matrix operations:
```dart
Matrix4 m1 = Matrix4.identity();
Matrix4 m2 = Matrix4.rotationX(pi / 2);
Matrix4 result = m1 * m2;
print(result); // prints Matrix4(...);
```
* Statistical analysis:
```dart
List<double> data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
double mean = data.mean();
print(mean); // prints 3.0
```
Platform-Specific Details
-------------------------

The maths package is designed to work on both Android and iOS platforms. However, some features may require platform-specific configurations or optimizations.

For example, on Android, you may need to add the following configuration to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:
```xml
<application>
  ...
  <meta-data
    android:name="flutter.embedded_views"
    android:resource="@array/flutter_embedded_views"/>
  ...
</application>
```
On iOS, you may need to add the following configuration to your `Info.plist` file:
```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
  <string>processing</string>
</array>
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Step 1: Create a vector
  Vector3 _vector = Vector3(1, 2, 3);

  // Step 2: Create a matrix
  Matrix4 _matrix = Matrix4.identity();

  // Step 3: Perform vector math
  void _performVectorMath() {
    Vector3 result = _vector + Vector3(4, 5, 6);
    print(result); // prints Vector3(5, 7, 9)
  }

  // Step 4: Perform matrix operations
  void _performMatrixOperations() {
    Matrix4 result = _matrix * Matrix4.rotationX(pi / 2);
    print(result); // prints Matrix4(...);
  }

  // Step 5: Perform statistical analysis
  void _performStatisticalAnalysis() {
    List<double> data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    double mean = data.mean();
    print(mean); // prints 3.0
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Maths Package Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _performVectorMath,
              child: Text('Perform Vector Math'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _performMatrixOperations,
              child: Text('Perform Matrix Operations'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _performStatisticalAnalysis,
              child: Text('Perform Statistical Analysis'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a screen containing three buttons.
// 2. The user clicks the "Perform Vector Math" button, which calls the _performVectorMath function.
// 3. The _performVectorMath function creates a new vector by adding two vectors together and prints the result.
// 4. The user clicks the "Perform Matrix Operations" button, which calls the _performMatrixOperations function.
// 5. The _performMatrixOperations function creates a new matrix by multiplying two matrices together and prints the result.
// 6. The user clicks the "Perform Statistical Analysis" button, which calls the _performStatisticalAnalysis function.
// 7. The _performStatisticalAnalysis function calculates the mean of a list of numbers and prints the result.

// In summary, this app demonstrates the use of the maths package to perform vector math, matrix operations, and statistical analysis.
