# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the `story_view` Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `story_view` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  story_view: ^0.14.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to enable the use of Swift in your project. Open your `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode, and ensure that the project settings are configured to support Swift.

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `story_view` package.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:story_view/story_view.dart';
```

2. Create a list of stories:

```dart
final List<StoryItem> storyItems = [
  StoryItem.text(title: "Welcome to Story View!", backgroundColor: Colors.blue),
  StoryItem.pageImage(url: "https://example.com/image1.jpg", caption: "Image 1"),
  StoryItem.pageVideo(url: "https://example.com/video1.mp4", caption: "Video 1"),
];
```

3. Use the `StoryView` widget in your widget tree:

```dart
StoryView(
  storyItems: storyItems,
  controller: storyController,
  onStoryShow: (storyItem) {
    print("Showing a story: ${storyItem.title}");
  },
  onComplete: () {
    print("Story view completed");
  },
);
```

With these steps, you can easily integrate the `story_view` package into your Flutter application and start creating engaging story experiences for your users.

# Complete Example of Using the `story_view` Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:story_view/story_view.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Story View Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: StoryViewScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class StoryViewScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  // Create a StoryController to manage the story view
  final StoryController storyController = StoryController();

  // List of story items to display
  final List<StoryItem> storyItems = [
    StoryItem.text(title: "Welcome to Story View!", backgroundColor: Colors.blue),
    StoryItem.pageImage(url: "https://example.com/image1.jpg", caption: "Image 1"),
    StoryItem.pageVideo(url: "https://example.com/video1.mp4", caption: "Video 1"),
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Story View Example'),
      ),
      body: StoryView(
        storyItems: storyItems,
        controller: storyController,
        onStoryShow: (storyItem) {
          // Callback when a story is shown
          print("Showing a story: ${storyItem.title}");
        },
        onComplete: () {
          // Callback when all stories are completed
          print("Story view completed");
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets MyApp as the home widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme, and sets StoryViewScreen as the home.
// 3. StoryViewScreen creates a StoryController to manage the story view and a list of StoryItems.
// 4. The Scaffold widget provides an AppBar and a body containing the StoryView widget.
// 5. The StoryView widget displays the stories, and callbacks are provided to handle story display and completion events.
