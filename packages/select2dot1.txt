# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using select2dot1

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `select2dot1` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `select2dot1` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  select2dot1: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Open the `Podfile` and uncomment the platform line, setting it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `select2dot1` dropdown in your app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:select2dot1/select2dot1.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Select2Dot1 Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Select2Dot1(
            items: [
              'Option 1',
              'Option 2',
              'Option 3',
              'Option 4',
            ],
            onChanged: (value) {
              // Handle the selected value
              print('Selected: $value');
            },
            hint: 'Select an option',
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with a dropdown that allows users to select from four options. The selected value is printed to the console.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we covered the installation and basic usage of the `select2dot1` package in a Flutter application. We also discussed platform-specific configurations for Android and iOS. With this setup, you can now implement a customizable dropdown selection feature in your Flutter apps.

# Complete Example of select2dot1 in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:select2dot1/select2dot1.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to hold the selected value
  String? selectedValue;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Select2Dot1 Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Dropdown widget
              Select2Dot1(
                items: [
                  'Option 1',
                  'Option 2',
                  'Option 3',
                  'Option 4',
                ],
                onChanged: (value) {
                  // Update the selected value when an option is chosen
                  setState(() {
                    selectedValue = value;
                  });
                  // Print the selected value to the console
                  print('Selected: $value');
                },
                hint: 'Select an option',
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Display the selected value
              Text(
                selectedValue != null ? 'You selected: $selectedValue' : 'No option selected',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

```dart
// Explanation of the application flow:

// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatefulWidget, allowing it to maintain the state of the selected value.
// 3. Inside the _RealFlutterState class, we define a variable 'selectedValue' to hold the currently selected option.
// 4. The build method constructs the UI, which includes a Select2Dot1 dropdown and a Text widget to display the selected value.
// 5. When the user selects an option from the dropdown, the onChanged callback is triggered.
// 6. The selected value is updated using setState, which rebuilds the UI to reflect the new selection.
// 7. The selected value is printed to the console and displayed on the screen.
// 8. If no option is selected, a default message is shown.
```
