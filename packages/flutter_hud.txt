<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Flutter HUD Package Overview

The `flutter_hud` package is a lightweight and customizable loading indicator for Flutter applications. It provides a simple way to display a loading spinner or progress indicator while performing asynchronous tasks, enhancing the user experience by providing visual feedback during operations that may take time, such as network requests or data processing.

## When to Use `flutter_hud`

You should consider using `flutter_hud` in scenarios where:
- You need to inform users that a background process is ongoing.
- You want to improve the perceived performance of your app by showing loading indicators.
- You require a customizable loading experience that fits your app's design.

## Features
- **Customizable Appearance**: You can easily change the color, size, and style of the loading indicator.
- **Flexible Usage**: Supports both modal and non-modal loading indicators.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that allows for quick setup and usage in your Flutter app.

Overall, `flutter_hud` is an excellent choice for developers looking to enhance their Flutter applications with user-friendly loading indicators.

# Setting Up and Using `flutter_hud`

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To use the `flutter_hud` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_hud: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_hud).

## Step 2: Install the Package

Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` file to allow network requests if you are loading data from the internet. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Using `flutter_hud` in Your App

You can now use `flutter_hud` in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_hud/flutter_hud.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter HUD Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Show the loading indicator
              Hud.show(context);
              // Simulate a network request
              await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));
              // Hide the loading indicator
              Hud.hide();
            },
            child: Text('Show Loading'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, a loading indicator appears for 2 seconds, simulating a network request.

# Complete Example of `flutter_hud`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_hud/flutter_hud.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter HUD Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Show the loading indicator
              Hud.show(context);
              // Simulate a network request
              await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));
              // Hide the loading indicator
              Hud.hide();
            },
            child: Text('Show Loading'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'Flutter HUD Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 5. An ElevatedButton is created, which, when pressed, triggers an asynchronous function.
// 6. Inside the button's onPressed callback, the Hud.show(context) method is called to display the loading indicator.
// 7. A simulated network request is represented by a Future.delayed that lasts for 2 seconds.
// 8. After the delay, Hud.hide() is called to remove the loading indicator from the screen.
// 9. The user sees the loading indicator for 2 seconds before it disappears, providing feedback during the simulated operation.
