# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Theme Extensions Builder Annotation Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `theme_extensions_builder_annotation` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `theme_extensions_builder_annotation` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  theme_extensions_builder_annotation: ^1.0.0
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Setting Up the Annotation Processor

For the package to work correctly, you need to configure the annotation processor. This is done by adding the following to your `build.gradle` file for Android:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    buildFeatures {
        // Enable annotation processing
        annotationProcessor true
    }
}
```

For iOS, ensure that your project is set up to support Swift, as the package may require Swift for certain functionalities.

## Step 3: Creating Theme Extensions

Now, let's create a theme extension. You can define a custom theme by creating a Dart file, for example, `app_theme.dart`:

```dart
import 'package:theme_extensions_builder_annotation/theme_extensions_builder_annotation.dart';

part 'app_theme.g.dart';

@ThemeExtension()
class AppTheme {
  final Color primaryColor;
  final Color accentColor;

  AppTheme({required this.primaryColor, required this.accentColor});
}
```

## Step 4: Using the Theme in Your Application

To use the defined theme in your application, you can do the following in your `main.dart` file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'app_theme.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Theme Extensions Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final appTheme = AppTheme(primaryColor: Colors.blue, accentColor: Colors.orange);
    
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Theme Extensions Example'),
        backgroundColor: appTheme.primaryColor,
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Hello, Theme Extensions!',
          style: TextStyle(color: appTheme.accentColor),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Running the Application

Now that everything is set up, you can run your application using `flutter run`. You should see a simple app with a themed AppBar and text.

This tutorial has covered the essential steps to set up and use the `theme_extensions_builder_annotation` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using Theme Extensions Builder Annotation

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'app_theme.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Define the main theme of the application
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Theme Extensions Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create an instance of the AppTheme with custom colors
    final appTheme = AppTheme(primaryColor: Colors.blue, accentColor: Colors.orange);
    
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Theme Extensions Example'),
        backgroundColor: appTheme.primaryColor, // Use primary color from AppTheme
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Hello, Theme Extensions!',
          style: TextStyle(color: appTheme.accentColor), // Use accent color from AppTheme
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds the MaterialApp, setting the title and theme.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is set as the home of the MaterialApp.
// 4. In HomeScreen, an instance of AppTheme is created with specified primary and accent colors.
// 5. The AppBar uses the primary color from AppTheme for its background.
// 6. The body of the Scaffold displays a centered text widget that uses the accent color from AppTheme.
