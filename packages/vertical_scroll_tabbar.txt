# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Vertical Scroll TabBar

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the `vertical_scroll_tabbar` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  vertical_scroll_tabbar: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:vertical_scroll_tabbar/vertical_scroll_tabbar.dart';
```

## Step 4: Basic Configuration
### Android Configuration
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration
For iOS, ensure that your `ios/Podfile` has the platform set to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 5: Using the Vertical Scroll TabBar
You can now use the `VerticalScrollTabBar` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
VerticalScrollTabBar(
  tabs: [
    Tab(text: 'Home'),
    Tab(text: 'Profile'),
    Tab(text: 'Settings'),
  ],
  onTap: (index) {
    // Handle tab change
  },
)
```

This will create a vertical tab bar with three tabs: Home, Profile, and Settings. You can customize the `onTap` callback to handle tab changes as needed.

# Complete Example of Vertical Scroll TabBar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:vertical_scroll_tabbar/vertical_scroll_tabbar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Vertical Scroll TabBar Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Vertical Scroll TabBar'),
        ),
        body: Row(
          children: [
            // Vertical Scroll TabBar on the left
            VerticalScrollTabBar(
              tabs: [
                Tab(text: 'Home'),
                Tab(text: 'Profile'),
                Tab(text: 'Settings'),
              ],
              onTap: (index) {
                // Handle tab change
              },
            ),
            // Main content area
            Expanded(
              child: TabBarView(
                children: [
                  Center(child: Text('Home Content')),
                  Center(child: Text('Profile Content')),
                  Center(child: Text('Settings Content')),
                ],
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body consists of a Row widget that holds the VerticalScrollTabBar and a TabBarView.
// 5. The VerticalScrollTabBar displays three tabs: Home, Profile, and Settings.
// 6. When a tab is tapped, the onTap callback is triggered, allowing you to handle the tab change.
// 7. The TabBarView displays the corresponding content for each tab, which is centered in the main content area.
