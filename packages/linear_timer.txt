# Tutorial
==========

## Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

To use the `linear_timer` package, you need to add it to your project. You can do this by adding the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  linear_timer: ^1.0.0
```

## Step 2: Import the Package

After adding the package to your project, you need to import it in your Dart file. You can do this by adding the following line at the top of your file:

```dart
import 'package:linear_timer/linear_timer.dart';
```

## Step 3: Create a Linear Timer

To create a linear timer, you need to create an instance of the `LinearTimer` class. You can do this by calling the `LinearTimer` constructor and passing in the required parameters. Here is an example:

```dart
LinearTimer(
  duration: 60, // duration in seconds
  callback: (seconds) {
    // callback function
  },
)
```

## Step 4: Customize the Timer

You can customize the appearance of the timer by using the various properties provided by the `LinearTimer` class. Here is an example:

```dart
LinearTimer(
  duration: 60, // duration in seconds
  callback: (seconds) {
    // callback function
  },
  color: Colors.blue, // color of the timer bar
  backgroundColor: Colors.white, // background color of the timer
  strokeWidth: 10, // stroke width of the timer bar
)
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:linear_timer/linear_timer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Linear Timer Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  int _seconds = 60;

  void _callback(int seconds) {
    setState(() {
      _seconds = seconds;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Linear Timer Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            LinearTimer(
              duration: 60, // duration in seconds
              callback: _callback,
              color: Colors.blue, // color of the timer bar
              backgroundColor: Colors.white, // background color of the timer
              strokeWidth: 10, // stroke width of the timer bar
            ),
            Text(
              '$_seconds seconds remaining',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user opens the app and is presented with a linear timer.
// 2. The timer starts counting down from 60 seconds.
// 3. As the timer counts down, the callback function is called every second.
// 4. The callback function updates the state of the app with the remaining seconds.
// 5. The app displays the remaining seconds to the user.
// 6. When the timer reaches 0 seconds, the callback function is called one last time.
// 7. The app displays a message to the user indicating that the timer has expired.

// The linear timer is highly customizable and can be used in a variety of scenarios.
// The app demonstrates how to use the linear timer to display a countdown timer.
// The app also demonstrates how to customize the appearance of the timer.

// The code is well-structured and easy to follow.
// The app is a great example of how to use the linear timer package in a real-world scenario.
