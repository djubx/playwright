<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Flutter Color Models Package

The `flutter_color_models` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that simplifies the manipulation and conversion of color models. It provides a comprehensive set of features for working with various color spaces, including RGB, HSL, HSV, and CMYK. This package is particularly useful for applications that require precise color management, such as graphic design tools, image processing apps, and any application where color representation is critical.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the `flutter_color_models` package in scenarios such as:
- **Graphic Design Applications**: When building apps that require color selection and manipulation.
- **Image Processing**: For applications that need to convert colors between different models for image editing.
- **Data Visualization**: When you need to represent data with specific color schemes.

## Features

- **Color Conversion**: Easily convert between different color models (e.g., RGB to HSL).
- **Color Manipulation**: Adjust colors by modifying their components (e.g., brightness, saturation).
- **Custom Color Models**: Define and work with custom color models as needed.

The package is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, making it a great addition to any Flutter developer's toolkit.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_color_models

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `flutter_color_models` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_color_models: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the package to start using it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_color_models/flutter_color_models.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package

You can now use the features of the `flutter_color_models` package. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to convert an RGB color to HSL:

```dart
void main() {
  // Define an RGB color
  Color rgbColor = Color.fromARGB(255, 255, 0, 0); // Red color

  // Convert RGB to HSL
  HSLColor hslColor = HSLColor.fromColor(rgbColor);
  print('HSL: ${hslColor.toString()}');
}
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to create a color in RGB format and convert it to HSL format.

# Complete Example of flutter_color_models

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_color_models/flutter_color_models.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Color Models Demo',
      home: ColorModelDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class ColorModelDemo extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Define an RGB color
    Color rgbColor = Color.fromARGB(255, 255, 0, 0); // Red color

    // Convert RGB to HSL
    HSLColor hslColor = HSLColor.fromColor(rgbColor);

    // Convert HSL back to RGB
    Color convertedRgbColor = hslColor.toColor();

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Color Models Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display the original RGB color
            Container(
              width: 100,
              height: 100,
              color: rgbColor,
              child: Center(child: Text('RGB', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white))),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Display the converted HSL color
            Container(
              width: 100,
              height: 100,
              color: convertedRgbColor,
              child: Center(child: Text('HSL', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white))),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget.
// 3. The ColorModelDemo widget is displayed as the home screen.
// 4. Inside ColorModelDemo, an RGB color (red) is defined.
// 5. The RGB color is converted to HSL using the HSLColor class.
// 6. The HSL color is then converted back to RGB.
// 7. The UI consists of two containers displaying the original RGB color and the converted HSL color.
// 8. The app demonstrates the conversion between color models visually.
```
