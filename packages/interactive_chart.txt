# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Interactive Chart Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `interactive_chart` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  interactive_chart: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # Ensure this is set to at least 10.0
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:interactive_chart/interactive_chart.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package

You can now use the `InteractiveChart` widget in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to create a line chart.

```dart
InteractiveChart(
  data: [
    ChartData(x: 'Jan', y: 30),
    ChartData(x: 'Feb', y: 50),
    ChartData(x: 'Mar', y: 20),
  ],
  title: 'Monthly Sales',
);
```

This code snippet creates a line chart displaying monthly sales data.

# Complete Example of Using the Interactive Chart Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:interactive_chart/interactive_chart.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Interactive Chart Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Interactive Chart Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: InteractiveChart(
            data: [
              ChartData(x: 'Jan', y: 30),
              ChartData(x: 'Feb', y: 50),
              ChartData(x: 'Mar', y: 20),
              ChartData(x: 'Apr', y: 40),
              ChartData(x: 'May', y: 60),
            ],
            title: 'Monthly Sales Data',
            xAxisLabel: 'Months',
            yAxisLabel: 'Sales',
            tooltip: (data) => 'Sales: ${data.y}',
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, the InteractiveChart widget is used to display the chart.
// 5. The chart is populated with monthly sales data, and it includes labels for the axes and tooltips for interactivity.
// 6. When the app runs, users can see the chart and interact with it to view detailed sales information.
