# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the "week_number" Package

## Installation
To get started with the `week_number` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  week_number: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
The `week_number` package is designed to work seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms. There are no additional configurations required for either platform, making it easy to integrate into your Flutter application.

## Basic Usage
To use the `week_number` package, you can import it into your Dart file as follows:

```dart
import 'package:week_number/week_number.dart';
```

You can then use the `weekOfYear` method to get the week number of a specific date. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
void main() {
  DateTime date = DateTime.now(); // Get the current date
  int weekNumber = date.weekOfYear; // Calculate the week number
  print('Current week number: $weekNumber');
}
```

This code snippet will print the current week number based on the current date.

# Complete Example of Using the "week_number" Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:week_number/week_number.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Start the Flutter application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Week Number Example',
      home: WeekNumberHome(), // Set the home widget
    );
  }
}

class WeekNumberHome extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    DateTime today = DateTime.now(); // Get today's date
    int weekNumber = today.weekOfYear; // Calculate the week number

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Week Number Calculator'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Today is week number: $weekNumber', // Display the week number
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the Flutter application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets the home to WeekNumberHome.
// 3. The WeekNumberHome widget retrieves the current date and calculates the week number using the weekOfYear method.
// 4. The week number is then displayed in the center of the screen within a Text widget.
// 5. The app features a simple UI with an AppBar and a centered text displaying the current week number.
