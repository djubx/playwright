# Setting Up and Using `flutter_vlc_player`

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_vlc_player` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application. We will cover platform-specific configurations for both Android and iOS.

## Setup Process

### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the `flutter_vlc_player` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_vlc_player: ^8.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### Step 3: iOS Configuration

For iOS, add the following permissions to your `Info.plist` file to allow network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Using the Package

### Basic Usage

1. **Import the Package**: Start by importing the package in your Dart file.

   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter_vlc_player/flutter_vlc_player.dart';
   ```

2. **Initialize the Player**: Create an instance of `VlcPlayerController` and initialize it with the desired media source.

   ```dart
   final VlcPlayerController _controller = VlcPlayerController.network(
     'https://www.example.com/video.mp4',
     autoPlay: true,
   );
   ```

3. **Create the Player Widget**: Use the `VlcPlayer` widget to display the video.

   ```dart
   VlcPlayer(
     controller: _controller,
     aspectRatio: 16 / 9,
     placeholder: Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator()),
   );
   ```

<-- MAIN -->

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_vlc_player/flutter_vlc_player.dart';

void main() => runApp(RealFlutterApp());

class RealFlutterApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter VLC Player Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: VideoPlayerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class VideoPlayerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _VideoPlayerScreenState createState() => _VideoPlayerScreenState();
}

class _VideoPlayerScreenState extends State<VideoPlayerScreen> {
  late VlcPlayerController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the VLC player controller with a network video URL
    _controller = VlcPlayerController.network(
      'https://www.example.com/video.mp4',
      autoPlay: true, // Automatically start playing the video
      options: VlcPlayerOptions(), // Additional VLC options can be set here
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the controller when the widget is disposed
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('VLC Player Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: VlcPlayer(
          controller: _controller, // Attach the controller to the player
          aspectRatio: 16 / 9, // Set the aspect ratio of the video
          placeholder: Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator()), // Placeholder while loading
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow:
// 1. The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutterApp`.
// 2. `RealFlutterApp` is a stateless widget that sets up the MaterialApp and specifies `VideoPlayerScreen` as the home screen.
// 3. `VideoPlayerScreen` is a stateful widget that manages the lifecycle of the `VlcPlayerController`.
// 4. In `initState`, the `VlcPlayerController` is initialized with a network video URL and set to autoplay.
// 5. The `VlcPlayer` widget is used in the `build` method to display the video, with a loading indicator as a placeholder.
// 6. The controller is disposed of in the `dispose` method to free up resources when the widget is removed from the widget tree.
```

This example demonstrates how to integrate the `flutter_vlc_player` package into a Flutter application to play a video from a network source. The application initializes a VLC player controller with a video URL and uses the `VlcPlayer` widget to display the video. The player automatically starts playing the video upon initialization, and a loading indicator is shown while the video is buffering. The controller is properly disposed of to manage resources efficiently.

By following this guide, you can easily incorporate advanced media playback capabilities into your Flutter applications using the `flutter_vlc_player` package.
