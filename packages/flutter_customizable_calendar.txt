# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_customizable_calendar

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_customizable_calendar` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_customizable_calendar` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_customizable_calendar: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple calendar widget in our Flutter application. Below is an example of how to implement the `flutter_customizable_calendar` package.

<!-- END_TUTORIAL -->

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_customizable_calendar/flutter_customizable_calendar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Customizable Calendar Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to hold the selected date
  DateTime? selectedDate;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Customizable Calendar'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Calendar widget
          CustomizableCalendar(
            onDateSelected: (date) {
              // Update the selected date when a date is tapped
              setState(() {
                selectedDate = date;
              });
            },
            // Customize the appearance of the calendar
            calendarStyle: CalendarStyle(
              selectedColor: Colors.blue,
              todayColor: Colors.green,
              eventColor: Colors.red,
            ),
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20),
          // Display the selected date
          Text(
            selectedDate != null
                ? 'Selected Date: ${selectedDate!.toLocal()}'.split(' ')[0]
                : 'No Date Selected',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application using the flutter_customizable_calendar package.
// 
// 1. **Main Function**: The `main` function initializes the app and sets `MyApp` as the home widget.
// 2. **MyApp Class**: This is the root widget of the application, which sets up the MaterialApp and theme.
// 3. **RealFlutter Class**: This is a stateful widget that contains the calendar and displays the selected date.
// 4. **State Management**: The `_RealFlutterState` class manages the state of the selected date.
// 5. **CustomizableCalendar Widget**: This widget is where the calendar is displayed. It takes a callback function `onDateSelected` to handle date selection.
// 6. **Calendar Customization**: The `calendarStyle` property allows customization of the calendar's appearance, including colors for selected, today, and event dates.
// 7. **Displaying Selected Date**: Below the calendar, the selected date is displayed. If no date is selected, a default message is shown.

// In summary, this application demonstrates how to integrate the `flutter_customizable_calendar` package into a Flutter app. The user can select a date from the calendar, and the selected date is displayed below the calendar. The app is structured to allow easy customization of the calendar's appearance and functionality.
