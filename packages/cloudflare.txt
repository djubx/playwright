# Tutorial: Setting Up the Cloudflare Flutter Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the Cloudflare Flutter package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the Cloudflare package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cloudflare: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in our Flutter application.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:cloudflare/cloudflare.dart';
```

2. Initialize the Cloudflare client with your API token:

```dart
final cloudflare = Cloudflare(apiToken: 'YOUR_API_TOKEN');
```

3. Use the client to manage DNS records or firewall rules as needed.

This setup will allow you to interact with Cloudflare's services directly from your Flutter application.

# Complete Example: Using the Cloudflare Flutter Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cloudflare/cloudflare.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Cloudflare Example',
      home: CloudflareHome(),
    );
  }
}

class CloudflareHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CloudflareHomeState createState() => _CloudflareHomeState();
}

class _CloudflareHomeState extends State<CloudflareHome> {
  // Initialize the Cloudflare client with your API token
  final Cloudflare cloudflare = Cloudflare(apiToken: 'YOUR_API_TOKEN');
  List<DNSRecord> dnsRecords = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Fetch DNS records when the widget is initialized
    fetchDNSRecords();
  }

  // Function to fetch DNS records from Cloudflare
  Future<void> fetchDNSRecords() async {
    try {
      // Call the Cloudflare API to get DNS records
      final records = await cloudflare.dns.listRecords(zoneId: 'YOUR_ZONE_ID');
      setState(() {
        dnsRecords = records; // Update the state with fetched records
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during the API call
      print('Error fetching DNS records: $e');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Cloudflare DNS Records'),
      ),
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: dnsRecords.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          final record = dnsRecords[index];
          return ListTile(
            title: Text(record.name), // Display the DNS record name
            subtitle: Text(record.type), // Display the DNS record type
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app and sets MyApp as the home widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets CloudflareHome as the home screen.
// 3. CloudflareHome is a stateful widget that initializes the Cloudflare client with an API token.
// 4. In the initState method, fetchDNSRecords is called to retrieve DNS records from Cloudflare.
// 5. fetchDNSRecords makes an API call to Cloudflare to get the DNS records for a specified zone.
// 6. The fetched records are stored in the dnsRecords list and the UI is updated using setState.
// 7. The build method creates a ListView to display the DNS records, showing the name and type of each record.
```
