# Overview of the OrbitMenu Flutter Package

The **OrbitMenu** package is a versatile and visually appealing menu widget for Flutter applications. It allows developers to create circular menus that can enhance the user experience by providing a unique way to present options. This package is particularly useful in applications where space is limited, or when a more engaging UI is desired.

## When to Use OrbitMenu
- **Mobile Applications**: Ideal for mobile apps where screen real estate is limited.
- **Games**: Great for game interfaces where quick access to options is needed.
- **Creative UIs**: Perfect for applications that aim to provide a modern and interactive user experience.

## Key Features
- **Customizable Menu Items**: Easily add, remove, or modify menu items.
- **Animation Support**: Smooth animations for opening and closing the menu.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.
- **Gesture Support**: Supports touch gestures for a more interactive experience.

The OrbitMenu package is a great choice for developers looking to implement a unique and functional menu system in their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using OrbitMenu

## Installation
To use the OrbitMenu package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  orbit_menu: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the OrbitMenu in your Flutter application, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:orbit_menu/orbit_menu.dart';
```

2. Create a simple widget that utilizes the OrbitMenu:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Orbit Menu Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: OrbitMenu(
          items: [
            MenuItem(icon: Icons.home, label: 'Home'),
            MenuItem(icon: Icons.settings, label: 'Settings'),
            MenuItem(icon: Icons.info, label: 'About'),
          ],
          onItemSelected: (item) {
            // Handle item selection
            print('Selected: ${item.label}');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic OrbitMenu with three items. The `onItemSelected` callback allows you to handle user interactions with the menu.

# Complete Example of OrbitMenu in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:orbit_menu/orbit_menu.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Orbit Menu Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Orbit Menu Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: OrbitMenu(
          items: [
            MenuItem(icon: Icons.home, label: 'Home'),
            MenuItem(icon: Icons.settings, label: 'Settings'),
            MenuItem(icon: Icons.info, label: 'About'),
          ],
          onItemSelected: (item) {
            // Handle item selection
            print('Selected: ${item.label}');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The main function initializes the app and sets up the MaterialApp widget.
// The MyApp class defines the app's title and theme.
// The RealFlutter class builds the main UI, which includes an AppBar and the OrbitMenu.
// The OrbitMenu is configured with three items: Home, Settings, and About.
// When a menu item is selected, the onItemSelected callback is triggered, printing the selected item's label to the console.
```
<!-- END_MAIN -->
```

### Summary of Application Flow
- The `main` function initializes the Flutter application and runs the `MyApp` widget.
- The `MyApp` widget sets up the Material design theme and specifies the home screen as `RealFlutter`.
- The `RealFlutter` widget builds the main UI, which includes an AppBar and the OrbitMenu.
- The OrbitMenu is populated with three menu items, each represented by an icon and a label.
- When a user selects a menu item, the `onItemSelected` callback is triggered, allowing you to handle the selection (in this case, printing the selected label to the console).

This example demonstrates how to effectively implement the OrbitMenu package in a Flutter application, providing a unique and interactive menu experience.
