# Setting Up and Using `flutter_quill_extensions`

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_quill_extensions` package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_quill_extensions` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_quill_extensions: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_quill_extensions).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_quill_extensions/flutter_quill_extensions.dart';
```

## Step 4: Basic Usage

You can now use the `QuillEditor` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
QuillEditor(
  controller: _controller,
  readOnly: false, // Set to true for read-only mode
  autoFocus: true,
  expands: true,
  padding: EdgeInsets.all(10),
),
```

## Step 5: Customizing the Editor

You can customize the editor by adding toolbars, setting themes, and more. Refer to the package documentation for advanced configurations.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and start using the `flutter_quill_extensions` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of `flutter_quill_extensions`

Below is a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the `flutter_quill_extensions` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_quill_extensions/flutter_quill_extensions.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Quill Extensions Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: QuillEditorDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class QuillEditorDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _QuillEditorDemoState createState() => _QuillEditorDemoState();
}

class _QuillEditorDemoState extends State<QuillEditorDemo> {
  // Create a Quill controller to manage the editor's state
  final QuillController _controller = QuillController.basic();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Quill Editor Demo'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Quill Editor for rich text editing
          Expanded(
            child: QuillEditor(
              controller: _controller,
              readOnly: false, // Set to true for read-only mode
              autoFocus: true,
              expands: true,
              padding: EdgeInsets.all(10),
            ),
          ),
          // Toolbar for text formatting options
          QuillToolbar.basic(controller: _controller),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to QuillEditorDemo, which is a stateful widget.
// 4. In QuillEditorDemo, we create a QuillController to manage the editor's state.
// 5. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Column.
// 6. The QuillEditor widget is placed inside an Expanded widget to take up available space.
// 7. A QuillToolbar is added below the editor for text formatting options.
// 8. Users can interact with the editor to format text, insert images, and more.
```
