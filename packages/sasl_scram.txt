# Overview of the sasl_scram Flutter Package

The `sasl_scram` package is a Flutter library designed to facilitate the implementation of the SCRAM (Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism) protocol. This package is particularly useful for developers who need to authenticate users securely in applications that communicate with a server, such as chat applications, online services, or any app requiring user login.

## When to Use This Package
- **User Authentication**: When building applications that require secure user authentication.
- **Server Communication**: For apps that need to communicate with a backend server using SCRAM for secure password-based authentication.
- **Real-time Applications**: Ideal for applications that require real-time data exchange while ensuring user credentials are protected.

## Key Features
- **Secure Authentication**: Implements SCRAM for secure password authentication.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that allows for quick integration into existing Flutter applications.
- **Customizable**: Offers options for customizing the authentication process to fit specific needs.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the sasl_scram Package

## Installation
To use the `sasl_scram` package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  sasl_scram: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable certain capabilities in your Xcode project, such as App Transport Security settings, to allow secure connections.

## Using the Package
To use the `sasl_scram` package, you will typically follow these steps:

1. **Import the Package**: Import the package in your Dart file.
2. **Create an Instance**: Create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class.
3. **Authenticate**: Use the provided methods to authenticate users.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the package:

```dart
import 'package:sasl_scram/sasl_scram.dart';

class RealFlutter {
  final SaslScram scram;

  RealFlutter(this.scram);

  Future<void> authenticate(String username, String password) async {
    // Start the authentication process
    final result = await scram.authenticate(username, password);
    if (result.isSuccess) {
      print('Authentication successful!');
    } else {
      print('Authentication failed: ${result.error}');
    }
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Using the sasl_scram Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sasl_scram/sasl_scram.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'SCRAM Authentication Demo',
      home: AuthPage(),
    );
  }
}

class AuthPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _AuthPageState createState() => _AuthPageState();
}

class _AuthPageState extends State<AuthPage> {
  final _usernameController = TextEditingController();
  final _passwordController = TextEditingController();
  final SaslScram _scram = SaslScram(); // Create an instance of SaslScram

  String _message = '';

  // Function to handle authentication
  Future<void> _authenticate() async {
    String username = _usernameController.text;
    String password = _passwordController.text;

    // Call the authenticate method from the RealFlutter class
    final result = await _scram.authenticate(username, password);
    setState(() {
      // Update the message based on authentication result
      _message = result.isSuccess ? 'Authentication successful!' : 'Authentication failed: ${result.error}';
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('SCRAM Authentication')),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              controller: _usernameController,
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Username'),
            ),
            TextField(
              controller: _passwordController,
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Password'),
              obscureText: true,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _authenticate,
              child: Text('Login'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(_message), // Display authentication message
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```
// The application starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and home page.
// The home page is AuthPage, which is a StatefulWidget for handling user input.
// Inside AuthPage, we create TextEditingControllers for username and password fields.
// The _authenticate method is called when the user presses the login button.
// It retrieves the username and password, then calls the authenticate method from SaslScram.
// Based on the result, it updates the _message state to inform the user of success or failure.
// The UI consists of text fields for input and a button to trigger authentication, along with a message display.
