# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `at_common_flutter`

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `at_common_flutter` package and demonstrate how to use its features effectively.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `at_common_flutter` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  at_common_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/at_common_flutter).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configurations

### Android Configuration

1. Open the `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

3. Add the necessary permissions in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file if your application requires internet access:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open the `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following key to allow network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement user authentication and real-time communication.

# Complete Example of `at_common_flutter`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:at_common_flutter/at_common_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'AT Common Flutter Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomePageState createState() => _HomePageState();
}

class _HomePageState extends State<HomePage> {
  // Initialize the AtCommon service
  final AtCommonService _atCommonService = AtCommonService();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Start the AtCommon service
    _atCommonService.start();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Stop the AtCommon service when the widget is disposed
    _atCommonService.stop();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Page'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () async {
            // Trigger user authentication
            bool isAuthenticated = await _atCommonService.authenticateUser();
            if (isAuthenticated) {
              // Navigate to the chat screen if authentication is successful
              Navigator.push(
                context,
                MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => ChatScreen()),
              );
            } else {
              // Show an error message if authentication fails
              ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                SnackBar(content: Text('Authentication Failed')),
              );
            }
          },
          child: Text('Login'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class ChatScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Chat Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to the chat!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The HomePage widget is set as the home screen of the app.
// 4. In the HomePage, the AtCommonService is initialized and started in initState.
// 5. When the user presses the 'Login' button, the app attempts to authenticate the user.
// 6. If authentication is successful, the app navigates to the ChatScreen.
// 7. If authentication fails, an error message is displayed using a SnackBar.
// 8. The ChatScreen displays a welcome message to the user.
```
