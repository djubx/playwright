# Custom Progress Button: A Comprehensive Overview

The `custom_progress_button` Flutter package is designed to enhance the user experience by providing customizable buttons that can display progress indicators. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where users need to be informed about ongoing processes, such as form submissions, file uploads, or any action that requires a waiting period.

## When to Use This Package
- **Form Submissions**: When users submit forms, you can show a progress button to indicate that the submission is in progress.
- **File Uploads**: For applications that allow file uploads, a progress button can inform users about the upload status.
- **Long-running Tasks**: Any action that takes time to complete can benefit from a visual indication of progress.

## Key Features
- **Customizable Appearance**: You can easily customize the button's appearance, including colors, shapes, and text.
- **Progress Indicators**: The package supports various types of progress indicators, such as circular and linear.
- **Animation Support**: Smooth animations enhance the user experience during transitions.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API for quick integration into existing Flutter applications.

Overall, the `custom_progress_button` package is a valuable tool for Flutter developers looking to improve user feedback during asynchronous operations.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Custom Progress Button

## Installation
To use the `custom_progress_button` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  custom_progress_button: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/custom_progress_button).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your button interacts with any system features that require user permissions.

## Basic Usage
To use the `custom_progress_button`, you can create a button in your widget tree. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:custom_progress_button/custom_progress_button.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  bool _isLoading = false;

  void _submit() {
    setState(() {
      _isLoading = true; // Start loading
    });

    // Simulate a network request
    Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2), () {
      setState(() {
        _isLoading = false; // Stop loading
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Custom Progress Button Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: CustomProgressButton(
          onPressed: _isLoading ? null : _submit, // Disable button if loading
          child: Text(_isLoading ? 'Loading...' : 'Submit'),
          progressIndicator: _isLoading ? CircularProgressIndicator() : null,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple button that shows a loading indicator when pressed. The button is disabled during the loading state to prevent multiple submissions.

# Complete Example of Custom Progress Button

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:custom_progress_button/custom_progress_button.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Custom Progress Button Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  bool _isLoading = false; // State variable to track loading status

  void _submit() {
    setState(() {
      _isLoading = true; // Set loading state to true
    });

    // Simulate a network request with a delay
    Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2), () {
      setState(() {
        _isLoading = false; // Reset loading state after delay
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Custom Progress Button Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: CustomProgressButton(
          onPressed: _isLoading ? null : _submit, // Disable button if loading
          child: Text(_isLoading ? 'Loading...' : 'Submit'), // Change button text based on loading state
          progressIndicator: _isLoading ? CircularProgressIndicator() : null, // Show progress indicator if loading
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is displayed as the home screen.
// 3. The user sees a button labeled 'Submit'.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the _submit method is called.
// 5. The button's state changes to loading, disabling further presses and changing the text to 'Loading...'.
// 6. A simulated network request is made with a 2-second delay.
// 7. After the delay, the loading state is reset, and the button is re-enabled with the original text.
