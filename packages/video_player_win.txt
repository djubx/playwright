# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Video Player Win Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `video_player_win` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  video_player_win: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/video_player_win).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### For Windows

1. **Enable Windows Desktop Support**: Ensure that your Flutter environment is set up for Windows development. You can check this by running:
   ```bash
   flutter config --enable-windows-desktop
   ```

2. **Add Required Permissions**: Depending on your video source, you may need to configure permissions in your `windows/Runner/Runner.rc` file. Ensure that your application has access to the necessary resources.

### For Android and iOS

While this package is primarily for Windows, if you plan to support other platforms, ensure you have the `video_player` package added for Android and iOS support. Follow the respective setup instructions for those platforms.

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the video player.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:video_player_win/video_player_win.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late VideoPlayerController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the video player controller with a video file
    _controller = VideoPlayerController.network(
      'https://www.example.com/video.mp4',
    )..initialize().then((_) {
        // Ensure the first frame is shown after the video is initialized
        setState(() {});
      });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the controller when the widget is disposed
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Video Player Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: _controller.value.isInitialized
            ? Column(
                mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
                children: [
                  AspectRatio(
                    aspectRatio: _controller.value.aspectRatio,
                    child: VideoPlayer(_controller),
                  ),
                  VideoPlayerControls(controller: _controller),
                ],
              )
            : CircularProgressIndicator(),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          setState(() {
            // Play or pause the video
            _controller.value.isPlaying ? _controller.pause() : _controller.play();
          });
        },
        child: Icon(
          _controller.value.isPlaying ? Icons.pause : Icons.play_arrow,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Initialization**: The `VideoPlayerController` is initialized with a video URL. The `initialize` method is called to prepare the video for playback.
- **State Management**: The `setState` method is used to update the UI once the video is initialized.
- **Video Controls**: A floating action button is provided to play or pause the video.

# Complete Example of Video Player Win

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:video_player_win/video_player_win.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late VideoPlayerController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the video player controller with a video file
    _controller = VideoPlayerController.network(
      'https://www.example.com/video.mp4',
    )..initialize().then((_) {
        // Ensure the first frame is shown after the video is initialized
        setState(() {});
      });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the controller when the widget is disposed
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Video Player Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: _controller.value.isInitialized
            ? Column(
                mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
                children: [
                  AspectRatio(
                    aspectRatio: _controller.value.aspectRatio,
                    child: VideoPlayer(_controller),
                  ),
                  VideoPlayerControls(controller: _controller),
                ],
              )
            : CircularProgressIndicator(),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          setState(() {
            // Play or pause the video
            _controller.value.isPlaying ? _controller.pause() : _controller.play();
          });
        },
        child: Icon(
          _controller.value.isPlaying ? Icons.pause : Icons.play_arrow,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the initState method, the VideoPlayerController is initialized with a video URL.
// 3. Once the video is initialized, the UI is updated to show the video player.
// 4. The build method checks if the video is initialized and displays the video player or a loading indicator.
// 5. A floating action button is provided to play or pause the video.
// 6. When the button is pressed, the video playback state is toggled, and the UI is updated accordingly.
