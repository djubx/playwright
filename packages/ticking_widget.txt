# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Ticking Widget

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started with the **ticking_widget** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ticking_widget: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:ticking_widget/ticking_widget.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Ticking Widget
You can now use the `TickingWidget` in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
TickingWidget(
  duration: Duration(seconds: 1), // Set the duration for each tick
  builder: (context, tick) {
    return Text(
      'Tick: $tick', // Display the current tick count
      style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
    );
  },
);
```

This will create a ticking widget that updates every second, displaying the current tick count.

# Complete Example of Ticking Widget

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ticking_widget/ticking_widget.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Ticking Widget Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Ticking Widget Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: TickingWidget(
            duration: Duration(seconds: 1), // Set the duration for each tick
            builder: (context, tick) {
              return Text(
                'Tick: $tick', // Display the current tick count
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Ticking Widget Demo'.
// 4. In the body of the Scaffold, a TickingWidget is created.
// 5. The TickingWidget updates every second, and the current tick count is displayed in the center of the screen.
// 6. The builder function of TickingWidget receives the current tick count and updates the Text widget accordingly.
```
