# Tutorial

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `list_wheel_scroll_view_nls` package and explain how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `list_wheel_scroll_view_nls` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  list_wheel_scroll_view_nls: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:list_wheel_scroll_view_nls/list_wheel_scroll_view_nls.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the `ListWheelScrollViewNls` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
ListWheelScrollViewNls(
  itemExtent: 50, // Height of each item
  children: List<Widget>.generate(100, (index) {
    return Center(
      child: Text('Item $index'),
    );
  }),
  onSelectedItemChanged: (index) {
    print('Selected Item: $index');
  },
)
```

This code creates a scrollable list of items where each item is centered and has a height of 50 pixels. The `onSelectedItemChanged` callback will print the index of the selected item.

# Complete Example

Below is a complete Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the `list_wheel_scroll_view_nls` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:list_wheel_scroll_view_nls/list_wheel_scroll_view_nls.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'List Wheel Scroll View Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('List Wheel Scroll View Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ListWheelScrollViewNls(
            itemExtent: 50, // Set the height of each item
            children: List<Widget>.generate(100, (index) {
              return Center(
                child: Text('Item $index'), // Display item text
              );
            }),
            onSelectedItemChanged: (index) {
              // Callback when the selected item changes
              print('Selected Item: $index');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body consists of a ListWheelScrollViewNls widget.
// 5. The ListWheelScrollViewNls widget generates 100 items, each displaying "Item X" where X is the index.
// 6. The itemExtent property defines the height of each item in the wheel.
// 7. The onSelectedItemChanged callback prints the index of the currently selected item to the console.
```
