# Setting Up and Using `flutter_dev_tools`

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_dev_tools` package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter projects.

## Installation

To add `flutter_dev_tools` to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_dev_tools: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_dev_tools).

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage

To use `flutter_dev_tools`, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_dev_tools/flutter_dev_tools.dart';
```

You can then initialize the tools in your `main` function:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
  FlutterDevTools.initialize();
}
```

This will set up the necessary hooks for performance monitoring and debugging.

# Complete Example of Using `flutter_dev_tools`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_dev_tools/flutter_dev_tools.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the Flutter Dev Tools
  runApp(RealFlutter());
  FlutterDevTools.initialize();
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Dev Tools Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  int _counter = 0;

  void _incrementCounter() {
    // Increment the counter and trigger a rebuild
    setState(() {
      _counter++;
    });
    // Log the counter value for debugging
    FlutterDevTools.log('Counter incremented: $_counter');
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Dev Tools Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'You have pushed the button this many times:',
            ),
            Text(
              '$_counter',
              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline4,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: _incrementCounter,
        tooltip: 'Increment',
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets up Flutter Dev Tools.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is the root widget of the application.
// 3. MyHomePage is a stateful widget that maintains a counter.
// 4. When the floating action button is pressed, the _incrementCounter method is called.
// 5. This method increments the counter and triggers a rebuild of the UI.
// 6. The current counter value is displayed on the screen.
// 7. The counter value is also logged using Flutter Dev Tools for debugging purposes.
