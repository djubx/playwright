      theme: ThemeData(

    secretKey: 'your_secret_key',
  );

  void _makePayment() async {
    // Create a payment request
    final paymentResponse = await _esewa.makePayment(
      amount: 100,
      productName: 'Test Product',
      productDescription: 'This is a test product',
      callBackUrl: 'https://example.com/callback',
    );

    // Check if the payment was successful
    if (paymentResponse.status == 'success') {
      print('Payment successful!');
    } else {
      print('Payment failed!');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('eSewa Flutter Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _makePayment,
          child: Text('Make Payment'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user clicks the "Make Payment" button.
// 2. The _makePayment function is called, which creates a payment request using the ESewaFlutter instance.
// 3. The payment request is sent to eSewa's API, which processes the payment.
// 4. The payment response is received and checked for success or failure.
// 5. If the payment was successful, a success message is printed to the console.
// 6. If the payment failed, a failure message is printed to the console.
