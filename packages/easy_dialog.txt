# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Easy Dialog

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **easy_dialog** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  easy_dialog: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using Easy Dialog

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create and display a dialog.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:easy_dialog/easy_dialog.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Easy Dialog Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Show the dialog when the button is pressed
              EasyDialog(
                title: 'Hello!',
                description: 'This is an easy dialog example.',
                // Add buttons to the dialog
                content: Column(
                  children: [
                    Text('This is a customizable dialog.'),
                    SizedBox(height: 20),
                    ElevatedButton(
                      onPressed: () {
                        Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                      },
                      child: Text('Close'),
                    ),
                  ],
                ),
              ).show(context); // Display the dialog
            },
            child: Text('Show Dialog'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app with a button that, when pressed, displays a dialog with a title, description, and a close button.

# Complete Example of Easy Dialog

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:easy_dialog/easy_dialog.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Easy Dialog Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Show the dialog when the button is pressed
              EasyDialog(
                title: 'Hello!',
                description: 'This is an easy dialog example.',
                // Add buttons to the dialog
                content: Column(
                  children: [
                    Text('This is a customizable dialog.'),
                    SizedBox(height: 20),
                    ElevatedButton(
                      onPressed: () {
                        Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                      },
                      child: Text('Close'),
                    ),
                  ],
                ),
              ).show(context); // Display the dialog
            },
            child: Text('Show Dialog'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The MaterialApp widget is created, providing the app structure.
// 3. A Scaffold widget is used to create the basic visual layout, including an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is placed.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the EasyDialog is instantiated with a title, description, and content.
// 6. The content includes a Text widget and another ElevatedButton to close the dialog.
// 7. The dialog is displayed using the show method, and when the close button is pressed, the dialog is dismissed using Navigator.of(context).pop().
// 8. This flow allows users to interact with the dialog easily, demonstrating the package's capabilities.
