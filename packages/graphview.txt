# GraphView Flutter Package
The GraphView Flutter package is a powerful library for creating complex, interactive graphs and node-based user interfaces. It provides a flexible and customizable way to visualize and interact with data, making it ideal for a wide range of applications, from social network analysis to data visualization and more.

With GraphView, you can create graphs with various types of nodes and edges, customize their appearance and behavior, and handle user interactions such as tapping, dragging, and zooming.

Some key features of the GraphView package include:

* Support for directed and undirected graphs
* Customizable node and edge rendering
* Interactive zooming and panning
* Support for multiple graph layouts
* Event handling for node and edge interactions

When to use GraphView:

* Social network analysis
* Data visualization
* Node-based user interfaces
* Interactive graph exploration

# Setting up GraphView

To use GraphView in your Flutter project, add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  graphview: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Platform-Specific Details

For Android, you need to add the following line to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

For iOS, you need to add the following line to your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

### Basic Usage

To create a graph with GraphView, you need to create a `Graph` object and add nodes and edges to it. Then, you can use the `GraphView` widget to display the graph.

Here is a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:graphview/GraphView.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: GraphView(
        graph: Graph()..addNode(Node.Id(1)),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:graphview/GraphView.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Create a graph object
  Graph graph = Graph();

  // Create nodes
  Node node1 = Node.Id(1);
  Node node2 = Node.Id(2);
  Node node3 = Node.Id(3);

  // Create edges
  Edge edge1 = Edge(node1, node2);
  Edge edge2 = Edge(node2, node3);

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();

    // Add nodes to the graph
    graph.addNode(node1);
    graph.addNode(node2);
    graph.addNode(node3);

    // Add edges to the graph
    graph.addEdge(edge1);
    graph.addEdge(edge2);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: GraphView(
        graph: graph,

        // Customize node rendering
        nodeBuilder: (node) {
          return Container(
            decoration: BoxDecoration(
              shape: BoxShape.circle,
              color: Colors.blue,
            ),
            child: Text(node.id.toString()),
          );
        },

        // Customize edge rendering
        edgeBuilder: (edge) {
          return Line(
            lineStyle: LineStyle(
              color: Colors.red,
              thickness: 2,
            ),
          );
        },

        // Handle node tap
        onNodeTap: (node) {
          print('Node ${node.id} tapped');
        },

        // Handle edge tap
        onEdgeTap: (edge) {
          print('Edge ${edge.source.id} -> ${edge.target.id} tapped');
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The graph object is created and nodes and edges are added to it.
// 2. The GraphView widget is used to display the graph.
// 3. The nodeBuilder and edgeBuilder properties are used to customize node and edge rendering.
// 4. The onNodeTap and onEdgeTap properties are used to handle node and edge taps.
// 5. When a node or edge is tapped, the corresponding callback is called.

// This code creates a graph with three nodes and two edges, and displays it using the GraphView widget.
// The nodes are rendered as blue circles with the node ID displayed inside, and the edges are rendered as red lines.
// When a node or edge is tapped, a message is printed to the console indicating which node or edge was tapped.
