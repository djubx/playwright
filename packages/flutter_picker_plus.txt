# Setting Up and Using Flutter Picker Plus

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_picker_plus` package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_picker_plus` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_picker_plus: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a basic picker.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_picker_plus/flutter_picker_plus.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Picker Plus Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Trigger the picker when the button is pressed
              showPicker(context);
            },
            child: Text('Open Picker'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void showPicker(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a list of options for the picker
    List<String> options = ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3'];

    // Show the picker
    Picker(
      adapter: PickerDataAdapter<String>(pickerdata: options),
      title: Text('Select an Option'),
      onConfirm: (Picker picker, List<int> value) {
        // Handle the selected option
        String selectedOption = options[value[0]];
        print('Selected: $selectedOption');
      },
    ).showDialog(context);
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with a button that opens a picker when pressed. The picker allows users to select from a list of options.

# Complete Example of Flutter Picker Plus

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_picker_plus/flutter_picker_plus.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Picker Plus Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Trigger the picker when the button is pressed
              showPicker(context);
            },
            child: Text('Open Picker'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void showPicker(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a list of options for the picker
    List<String> options = ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3'];

    // Show the picker
    Picker(
      adapter: PickerDataAdapter<String>(pickerdata: options),
      title: Text('Select an Option'),
      onConfirm: (Picker picker, List<int> value) {
        // Handle the selected option
        String selectedOption = options[value[0]];
        print('Selected: $selectedOption');
      },
    ).showDialog(context);
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which builds a MaterialApp.
// 2. The main screen contains an AppBar and a Center widget with a button.
// 3. When the button is pressed, the showPicker method is called.
// 4. Inside showPicker, a list of options is defined.
// 5. A Picker is created with the options and a title.
// 6. When the user confirms their selection, the selected option is printed to the console.
