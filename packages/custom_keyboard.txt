# Custom Keyboard Flutter Package

The `custom_keyboard` Flutter package provides developers with the ability to create and implement custom keyboard layouts for their applications. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where the default keyboard does not meet the specific needs of the application, such as in gaming apps, specialized data entry forms, or any application requiring a unique input method.

## When to Use This Package
- **Gaming Applications**: When you need a custom control scheme that differs from the standard keyboard layout.
- **Data Entry Forms**: For applications that require specific input types, such as numeric input or custom symbols.
- **User Experience**: To enhance user experience by providing a tailored keyboard that fits the app's theme and functionality.

## Features
- **Custom Layouts**: Create fully customizable keyboard layouts.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API for integrating the custom keyboard into your Flutter application.
- **Event Handling**: Built-in support for handling key events and actions.

Overall, the `custom_keyboard` package is a powerful tool for developers looking to enhance user input in their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Custom Keyboard

## Installation
To add the `custom_keyboard` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  custom_keyboard: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/custom_keyboard).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions if your keyboard requires any special features. Typically, no additional configuration is needed for basic usage.

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to adjust your app's settings in Xcode to ensure that the keyboard behaves as expected. This may include setting up the appropriate permissions or configurations based on your app's requirements.

## Basic Usage
To use the `custom_keyboard` package, you will need to create a custom keyboard widget and integrate it into your application. Below is a simple example of how to set up a custom keyboard.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:custom_keyboard/custom_keyboard.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Custom Keyboard Example')),
        body: CustomKeyboardExample(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class CustomKeyboardExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CustomKeyboardExampleState createState() => _CustomKeyboardExampleState();
}

class _CustomKeyboardExampleState extends State<CustomKeyboardExample> {
  String input = '';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        TextField(
          onChanged: (value) {
            setState(() {
              input = value;
            });
          },
          decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Input'),
        ),
        CustomKeyboard(
          onKeyPressed: (key) {
            setState(() {
              input += key; // Append the pressed key to the input
            });
          },
        ),
        Text('Current Input: $input'),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that includes a text field and a custom keyboard. The keyboard appends the pressed keys to the input string displayed below.

# Complete Example of Custom Keyboard

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:custom_keyboard/custom_keyboard.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Custom Keyboard Example')),
        body: CustomKeyboardExample(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class CustomKeyboardExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CustomKeyboardExampleState createState() => _CustomKeyboardExampleState();
}

class _CustomKeyboardExampleState extends State<CustomKeyboardExample> {
  String input = ''; // Variable to hold the current input

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        TextField(
          onChanged: (value) {
            setState(() {
              input = value; // Update the input variable when text changes
            });
          },
          decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Input'),
        ),
        CustomKeyboard(
          onKeyPressed: (key) {
            setState(() {
              input += key; // Append the pressed key to the input
            });
          },
        ),
        Text('Current Input: $input'), // Display the current input
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and the CustomKeyboardExample widget.
// 3. CustomKeyboardExample is a stateful widget that maintains the current input string.
// 4. The TextField allows users to input text, updating the input variable on change.
// 5. The CustomKeyboard widget listens for key presses and appends the pressed key to the input string.
// 6. The current input is displayed below the keyboard, updating in real-time as keys are pressed.
