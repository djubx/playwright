# Tutorial: Setting Up Pusher Channels in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `pusher_channels_flutter` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

First, add the `pusher_channels_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  pusher_channels_flutter: ^0.1.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Configure Pusher

### Create a Pusher Account

1. Go to the [Pusher website](https://pusher.com/) and create an account.
2. Create a new app in the Pusher dashboard and note down your App ID, Key, Secret, and Cluster.

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add internet permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Initialize Pusher in Your App

Now, let's initialize Pusher in your Flutter application. Create a new Dart file, for example, `pusher_service.dart`, and set up the Pusher client.

```dart
import 'package:pusher_channels_flutter/pusher_channels_flutter.dart';

class PusherService {
  late PusherChannelsFlutter pusher;

  void init() async {
    // Initialize Pusher with your credentials
    pusher = PusherChannelsFlutter(
      appKey: 'YOUR_APP_KEY',
      cluster: 'YOUR_APP_CLUSTER',
      authEndpoint: 'YOUR_AUTH_ENDPOINT', // Optional for private channels
    );

    // Connect to Pusher
    await pusher.connect();
  }

  void subscribeToChannel(String channelName) {
    // Subscribe to a channel
    pusher.subscribe(channelName);
  }

  void bindEvent(String channelName, String eventName, Function callback) {
    // Bind an event to a callback
    pusher.bind(eventName, callback, channelName);
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Use Pusher in Your Flutter App

In your main application file, you can now use the `PusherService` to connect and listen for events.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'pusher_service.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Pusher Channels Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  final PusherService pusherService = PusherService();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    pusherService.init();
    pusherService.subscribeToChannel('my-channel');
    pusherService.bindEvent('my-channel', 'my-event', (data) {
      // Handle incoming data
      print('Received data: $data');
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Pusher Channels Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Listening for events...'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Pusher Channels in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'pusher_service.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Pusher Channels Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  final PusherService pusherService = PusherService();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize Pusher service
    pusherService.init();
    // Subscribe to a channel named 'my-channel'
    pusherService.subscribeToChannel('my-channel');
    // Bind an event named 'my-event' to a callback function
    pusherService.bindEvent('my-channel', 'my-event', (data) {
      // Handle incoming data from the event
      print('Received data: $data');
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Pusher Channels Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Listening for events...'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds the MaterialApp and sets HomeScreen as the home widget.
// 3. In HomeScreen's initState, the PusherService is initialized.
// 4. The app subscribes to 'my-channel' to listen for events.
// 5. An event listener is set up for 'my-event', which prints received data to the console.
// 6. The UI displays a simple message indicating that it is listening for events.
