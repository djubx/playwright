# Understanding the `graphs` Flutter Package

The `graphs` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to facilitate the creation and manipulation of graph data structures within Flutter applications. This package is particularly useful for developers who need to implement complex data relationships, such as social networks, dependency graphs, or any scenario where entities are interconnected.

## When to Use the `graphs` Package

- **Social Networks**: Model users and their connections.
- **Dependency Management**: Visualize and manage dependencies in a project.
- **Pathfinding Algorithms**: Implement algorithms like Dijkstra's or A* for navigation systems.
- **Data Visualization**: Create interactive graphs to represent data relationships.

## Key Features

- **Graph Data Structures**: Provides a variety of graph structures, including directed and undirected graphs.
- **Algorithm Support**: Includes implementations of common graph algorithms.
- **Customizability**: Allows for the creation of custom graph types and algorithms.
- **Ease of Use**: Designed to integrate seamlessly with Flutter applications.

# Setting Up and Using the `graphs` Package in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up the `graphs` package in a Flutter project and demonstrate its usage with a simple example.

## Setup Process

1. **Add Dependency**: First, add the `graphs` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     graphs: ^0.2.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run `flutter pub get` to install the new package.

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**: The `graphs` package is platform-agnostic, meaning it does not require any specific configuration for Android or iOS. However, ensure your Flutter environment is set up correctly for both platforms.

## Using the `graphs` Package

To use the `graphs` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:graphs/graphs.dart';
```

### Basic Usage

- **Creating a Graph**: You can create a graph by defining nodes and edges.
- **Running Algorithms**: Use built-in algorithms to traverse or analyze the graph.

# Complete Example: Building a Simple Graph Application

Below is a complete Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the `graphs` package. This example will create a simple directed graph and perform a traversal.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:graphs/graphs.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutterApp());
}

class RealFlutterApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Graphs Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: GraphDemoPage(),
    );
  }
}

class GraphDemoPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _GraphDemoPageState createState() => _GraphDemoPageState();
}

class _GraphDemoPageState extends State<GraphDemoPage> {
  // Define a list of nodes
  final List<String> nodes = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'];

  // Define edges as a map where each key has a list of connected nodes
  final Map<String, List<String>> edges = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['D'],
    'C': ['D', 'E'],
    'D': ['E'],
    'E': []
  };

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Graph Traversal Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _traverseGraph,
          child: Text('Traverse Graph'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to perform a simple graph traversal
  void _traverseGraph() {
    // Use the depthFirstSearch function from the graphs package
    final result = depthFirstSearch<String>(
      nodes,
      (node) => edges[node] ?? [],
    );

    // Display the traversal result
    showDialog(
      context: context,
      builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
        title: Text('Traversal Result'),
        content: Text('Visited nodes: ${result.join(', ')}'),
        actions: [
          TextButton(
            onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
            child: Text('OK'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code sets up a simple Flutter application that uses the `graphs` package.
// It defines a directed graph with nodes and edges, and performs a depth-first search traversal.
// The traversal result is displayed in a dialog box when the button is pressed.

// Application Flow:
// 1. The application starts with the `RealFlutterApp` widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The `GraphDemoPage` widget is the main screen, displaying a button to trigger graph traversal.
// 3. When the button is pressed, `_traverseGraph` is called, performing a depth-first search.
// 4. The result of the traversal is shown in an AlertDialog, listing the visited nodes in order.
