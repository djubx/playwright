// Application flow:
// 1. The user runs the app, and the `MyApp` widget is rendered.
// 2. The `MyApp` widget builds the `MaterialApp` widget, which sets the app's title and theme.
// 3. The `MaterialApp` widget renders the `MyHomePage` widget as its home page.
// 4. The `MyHomePage` widget builds a `Scaffold` widget with an `AppBar` and a `Center` widget.
// 5. The `Center` widget contains a `Column` widget with two children: two `RotatedCornerDecoration` widgets.
// 6. The first `RotatedCornerDecoration` widget has default settings and decorates a red container.
// 7. The second `RotatedCornerDecoration` widget has customized settings (corner radius and rotation angle) and decorates a blue container.
