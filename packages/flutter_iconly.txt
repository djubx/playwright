# Setting Up and Using flutter_iconly

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the **flutter_iconly** package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter applications.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **flutter_iconly** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_iconly: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

Once the package is installed, you need to import it into your Dart file where you want to use the icons:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_iconly/flutter_iconly.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using Icons in Your Application

You can now use the icons provided by the **flutter_iconly** package in your widgets. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use an icon in a `Container` widget:

```dart
Container(
  child: Icon(
    IconlyBold.home, // Using the home icon from the IconlyBold class
    size: 30.0, // Setting the size of the icon
    color: Colors.blue, // Setting the color of the icon
  ),
);
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Optimizations
