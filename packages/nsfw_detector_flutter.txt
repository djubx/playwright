# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using nsfw_detector_flutter

## Installation
To get started with `nsfw_detector_flutter`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  nsfw_detector_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/nsfw_detector_flutter).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to detect NSFW content.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to detect NSFW content.</string>
```

## Using the Package
To use the `nsfw_detector_flutter` package, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:nsfw_detector_flutter/nsfw_detector_flutter.dart';
```

2. Create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class and use its methods to analyze images.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the package to detect NSFW content in an image:

```dart
// Load an image from assets or the gallery
final imagePath = 'path_to_your_image.jpg';

// Use the nsfw_detector_flutter package to analyze the image
final result = await RealFlutter.analyzeImage(imagePath);

// Check the result
if (result.isNsfw) {
  print('The image contains NSFW content.');
} else {
  print('The image is safe for work.');
}
```

This basic setup allows you to integrate NSFW detection into your Flutter application effectively.

# Complete Example of nsfw_detector_flutter in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:nsfw_detector_flutter/nsfw_detector_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'NSFW Detector Example',
      home: NSFWDetectorScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class NSFWDetectorScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _NSFWDetectorScreenState createState() => _NSFWDetectorScreenState();
}

class _NSFWDetectorScreenState extends State<NSFWDetectorScreen> {
  String _resultMessage = 'Upload an image to check for NSFW content.';

  // Function to analyze the image
  Future<void> _analyzeImage(String imagePath) async {
    // Call the analyzeImage method from the RealFlutter class
    final result = await RealFlutter.analyzeImage(imagePath);

    // Update the result message based on the analysis
    setState(() {
      _resultMessage = result.isNsfw
          ? 'The image contains NSFW content.'
          : 'The image is safe for work.';
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('NSFW Detector'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(_resultMessage),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Here you would implement image picking logic
                // For demonstration, we will use a placeholder path
                String imagePath = 'path_to_your_image.jpg';
                _analyzeImage(imagePath);
              },
              child: Text('Analyze Image'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The NSFWDetectorScreen is displayed, showing a message and a button.
// 3. When the button is pressed, it simulates picking an image and calls _analyzeImage.
// 4. The _analyzeImage function uses the RealFlutter class to analyze the image.
// 5. Based on the result, it updates the UI to inform the user whether the image is NSFW or safe.
