# Device Preview Minus Flutter Package

The **device_preview_minus** package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that allows for easy device previewing and testing of applications across various screen sizes and orientations. This package is particularly useful for ensuring that your app's UI is responsive and looks great on all devices, from small phones to large tablets.

## When to Use This Package

- **Responsive Design Testing**: When developing a Flutter application, it's crucial to ensure that the UI adapts well to different screen sizes. This package allows developers to preview their app on various devices without needing to deploy to physical devices.
- **UI Debugging**: If you encounter layout issues, using device previews can help identify problems quickly by simulating different device environments.
- **Design Consistency**: Ensures that your app maintains a consistent look and feel across different devices.

## Features

- **Multiple Device Previews**: Simulate various devices, including phones and tablets, with different screen sizes and resolutions.
- **Orientation Changes**: Easily switch between portrait and landscape modes to see how your app responds.
- **Custom Device Profiles**: Create and use custom device profiles to match specific devices you want to test against.
- **Hot Reload Support**: Works seamlessly with Flutter's hot reload feature, allowing for quick iterations during development.

# Tutorial: Setting Up Device Preview Minus

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **device_preview_minus** package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the **device_preview_minus** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  device_preview_minus: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/device_preview_minus).

## Step 2: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:device_preview_minus/device_preview_minus.dart';
```

## Step 3: Wrap Your App with DevicePreview

You need to wrap your main application widget with `DevicePreview`. This allows you to access the device preview features.

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(
    DevicePreview(
      enabled: true, // Set to false to disable device preview
      builder: (context) => MyApp(),
    ),
  );
}
```

## Step 4: Configure for Android and iOS

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to allow for device previews:

```xml
<key>UIRequiresPersistentWiFi</key>
<true/>
```

## Step 5: Using Device Preview

You can now use the device preview features in your app. For example, you can change the device type and orientation using the UI provided by the package.

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return MaterialApp(
    builder: DevicePreview.appBuilder,
    home: Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Device Preview Example')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Hello, Device Preview!')),
    ),
  );
}
```

Now, you can run your app, and you will see the device preview options available in the UI.

# Complete Example of Device Preview Minus

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:device_preview_minus/device_preview_minus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    DevicePreview(
      enabled: true, // Enable device preview
      builder: (context) => RealFlutterApp(), // Main app widget
    ),
  );
}

class RealFlutterApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      builder: DevicePreview.appBuilder, // Use the device preview builder
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Device Preview Example'), // App title
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text('Hello, Device Preview!'), // Main text
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between elements
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Change device type on button press
                  DevicePreview.of(context).toggle();
                },
                child: Text('Toggle Device Preview'), // Button text
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and wraps it with DevicePreview.
// 2. The RealFlutterApp widget is defined as the main application widget.
// 3. Inside the RealFlutterApp, a MaterialApp is created with DevicePreview.appBuilder.
// 4. The home of the app is a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. The Center widget contains a Column with a greeting text and a button.
// 6. Pressing the button toggles the device preview, allowing the user to switch between device types.
```
