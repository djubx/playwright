You should consider using the `flutter_wizard` package in the following scenarios:

- **Onboarding Flows**: When you want to introduce new users to your app features step-by-step.
- **Multi-Step Forms**: For applications that require users to fill out lengthy forms divided into manageable sections.
- **Surveys and Questionnaires**: When collecting user feedback in a structured manner.

## Key Features

- **Step Management**: Easily manage the current step and navigate between steps.
- **Customizable UI**: Fully customizable step widgets to match your app's design.
- **Validation Support**: Built-in support for form validation at each step.

# Setting Up and Using the Flutter Wizard Package

## Installation

To get started with the `flutter_wizard` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_wizard: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage

To use the `flutter_wizard` package, you need to create a `RealFlutter` class that extends `StatefulWidget`. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set up a wizard with two steps:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_wizard/flutter_wizard.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Initialize the wizard controller
  final WizardController _controller = WizardController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Wizard(
        controller: _controller,
        steps: [
          Step(
            title: Text('Step 1'),
            content: TextField(
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter your name'),
            ),
          ),
          Step(
            title: Text('Step 2'),
            content: TextField(
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter your email'),
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple wizard with two steps, each containing a `TextField`. The `Wizard` widget manages the navigation between these steps.

# Complete Example of the Flutter Wizard Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_wizard/flutter_wizard.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Initialize the wizard controller
  final WizardController _controller = WizardController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Wizard Example'),
        ),
        body: Wizard(
          controller: _controller,
          steps: [
            Step(
              title: Text('Step 1: Name'),
              content: Column(
                children: [
                  TextField(
                    decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter your name'),
                  ),
                ],
              ),
            ),
            Step(
              title: Text('Step 2: Email'),
              content: Column(
                children: [
                  TextField(
                    decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter your email'),
                  ),
                ],
              ),
            ),
            Step(
              title: Text('Step 3: Confirmation'),
              content: Column(
                children: [
                  Text('Please confirm your details.'),
                  // Here you can display the entered details for confirmation
                ],
              ),
            ),
          ],
          onStepContinue: () {
            // Move to the next step
            _controller.next();
          },
          onStepCancel: () {
            // Move to the previous step
            _controller.previous();
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which initializes the WizardController.
// 2. The Wizard widget is created with three steps: Name, Email, and Confirmation.
// 3. Each step contains a TextField for user input or a confirmation message.
// 4. The onStepContinue callback is triggered when the user wants to proceed to the next step.
// 5. The onStepCancel callback allows the user to go back to the previous step.
// 6. The WizardController manages the current step and handles navigation between steps.
```

In this complete example, we have a simple wizard with three steps. The user can enter their name and email, and then confirm their details. The `WizardController` manages the navigation, allowing users to move forward and backward through the steps.

## Summary

The `flutter_wizard` package provides a robust solution for creating multi-step forms in Flutter applications. By following the setup and usage instructions, you can easily implement a wizard that enhances user experience and simplifies data collection. The example provided demonstrates how to structure your application and manage user input effectively, making it a valuable addition to any Flutter developer's toolkit.
