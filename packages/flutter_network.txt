// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The RealFlutter widget is created and initialized.
// 2. The FlutterNetwork instance is created and used to listen for network changes.
// 3. When the network connectivity status changes, the _isConnected variable is updated.
// 4. When the "Make Request" button is pressed, the _makeRequest function is called.
// 5. The _makeRequest function makes an HTTP request using the FlutterNetwork instance.
// 6. The HTTP request response is stored in the _response variable and displayed on the screen.
// 7. If an error occurs during the HTTP request, the error message is stored in the _response variable and displayed on the screen.
