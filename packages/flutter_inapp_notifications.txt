# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_inapp_notifications

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_inapp_notifications` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_inapp_notifications` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_inapp_notifications: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

2. **Enable Notification Channels**: Ensure that your app targets Android 8.0 (API level 26) or higher to use notification channels. You can set this in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           targetSdkVersion 31 // or higher
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request permission for notifications:

   ```xml
   <key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
   <array>
       <string>fetch</string>
       <string>remote-notification</string>
   </array>
   ```

2. **Request Notification Permissions**: You will need to request permission to show notifications when the app starts. This can be done in your Dart code.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your Flutter application.

1. **Import the Package**:

   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter_inapp_notifications/flutter_inapp_notifications.dart';
   ```

2. **Initialize Notifications**: You can initialize notifications in your main application file.

3. **Show Notifications**: Use the provided methods to display notifications based on user actions or events.

### Example Code Snippet

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to show a notification:

```dart
FlutterInappNotifications.createNotification(
  title: "New Message",
  body: "You have received a new message!",
);
```

With these steps, you can easily integrate in-app notifications into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of flutter_inapp_notifications

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_inapp_notifications/flutter_inapp_notifications.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'In-App Notifications Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: NotificationHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class NotificationHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _NotificationHomePageState createState() => _NotificationHomePageState();
}

class _NotificationHomePageState extends State<NotificationHomePage> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the notification service
    FlutterInappNotifications.init();
  }

  void _showNotification() {
    // Show a notification when the button is pressed
    FlutterInappNotifications.createNotification(
      title: "New Message",
      body: "You have received a new message!",
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('In-App Notifications'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _showNotification,
          child: Text('Show Notification'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The home page is set to NotificationHomePage.
// 3. In NotificationHomePage, we initialize the notification service in initState.
// 4. When the user presses the "Show Notification" button, the _showNotification method is called.
// 5. This method triggers the FlutterInappNotifications.createNotification method to display a notification with a title and body.
```
