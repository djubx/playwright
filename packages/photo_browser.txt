# Setting Up the Photo Browser Package
To use the `photo_browser` package, follow these steps:

1. Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:

```
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.
3. Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:photo_browser/photo_browser.dart';
```
4. Create a `PhotoBrowser` widget and pass in a list of image URLs:
```dart
PhotoBrowser(
  images: [
    'https://example.com/image1.jpg',
    'https://example.com/image2.jpg',
    'https://example.com/image3.jpg',
  ],
)
```
5. Customize the appearance and behavior of the `PhotoBrowser` widget by passing in optional parameters, such as `title`, `subtitle`, and `onSelectionChanged`.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />

          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user clicks the "Select Images" button, which opens the photo browser.
// 2. The user selects one or more images in the photo browser.
// 3. The selected images are returned to the main app and stored in the _selectedImages state.
// 4. The selected images are displayed below the "Select Images" button.
```

// The code flow is straightforward: the user clicks a button to select images, the photo browser opens, the user selects images, and the selected images are displayed in the main app.
