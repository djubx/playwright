# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Chart Sparkline Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `chart_sparkline` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  chart_sparkline: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a sparkline chart.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:chart_sparkline/chart_sparkline.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample data for the sparkline
    final List<double> data = [1.0, 2.5, 3.0, 2.0, 4.5, 3.5, 5.0];

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Sparkline Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Sparkline(
          data: data,
          lineColor: Colors.blue,
          pointsMode: PointsMode.all,
          pointColor: Colors.red,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    home: RealFlutter(),
  ));
}
```

In this example, we create a simple sparkline chart using a list of double values. The `Sparkline` widget takes care of rendering the chart based on the provided data.

# Complete Example of Chart Sparkline

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:chart_sparkline/chart_sparkline.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample data for the sparkline
    final List<double> data = [1.0, 2.5, 3.0, 2.0, 4.5, 3.5, 5.0];

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Sparkline Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Sparkline(
          data: data, // The data points for the sparkline
          lineColor: Colors.blue, // Color of the line
          pointsMode: PointsMode.all, // Show all points on the line
          pointColor: Colors.red, // Color of the points
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    home: RealFlutter(), // Entry point of the application
  ));
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the Flutter application.
// 2. It runs the MaterialApp widget, which is the root of the app.
// 3. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the UI.
// 4. Inside the build method, we define a list of double values representing the data for the sparkline.
// 5. The Scaffold widget provides a structure for the app, including an AppBar and a body.
// 6. The Sparkline widget is used to create the sparkline chart, taking the data and customizing its appearance.
// 7. The app displays a simple sparkline chart in the center of the screen, showing the trend of the data points.
