# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Anchor Tabs

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **anchor_tabs** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **anchor_tabs** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  anchor_tabs: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple application that demonstrates how to use the **anchor_tabs** package.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:anchor_tabs/anchor_tabs.dart';
```

2. Create a new class that extends `StatelessWidget` or `StatefulWidget` and implement the tabbed interface using `AnchorTabs`.

3. Define the tabs and their corresponding content.

This will be demonstrated in the complete example section below.

# Complete Example of Anchor Tabs

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:anchor_tabs/anchor_tabs.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Anchor Tabs Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  // This variable holds the index of the currently selected tab
  int _selectedIndex = 0;

  // List of widgets to display for each tab
  final List<Widget> _widgetOptions = <Widget>[
    Text('Home Tab Content'),
    Text('Search Tab Content'),
    Text('Profile Tab Content'),
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Anchor Tabs Example'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // AnchorTabs widget to create the tabbed interface
          AnchorTabs(
            tabs: [
              // Define the tabs with labels and icons
              TabItem(
                icon: Icons.home,
                title: 'Home',
              ),
              TabItem(
                icon: Icons.search,
                title: 'Search',
              ),
              TabItem(
                icon: Icons.person,
                title: 'Profile',
              ),
            ],
            // Set the selected index to highlight the active tab
            selectedIndex: _selectedIndex,
            // Callback function to handle tab changes
            onTap: (index) {
              setState(() {
                _selectedIndex = index; // Update the selected index
              });
            },
          ),
          // Display the content based on the selected tab
          Expanded(
            child: Center(
              child: _widgetOptions.elementAt(_selectedIndex),
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. HomeScreen is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the selected tab.
// 4. The _selectedIndex variable keeps track of the currently selected tab.
// 5. The _widgetOptions list contains the content for each tab.
// 6. The AnchorTabs widget creates the tabbed interface with defined tabs.
// 7. When a tab is tapped, the onTap callback updates the _selectedIndex.
// 8. The content displayed below the tabs changes based on the selected tab.
```
