# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using iamport_flutter

## Installation
To add the `iamport_flutter` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  iamport_flutter: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21  // Ensure this is set to at least 21
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:
   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. Ensure your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in `ios/Podfile`:
   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

## Using the Package
To use the `iamport_flutter` package, you will need to create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class and call the appropriate methods to initiate payments.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:iamport_flutter/iamport_flutter.dart';

class RealFlutter {
  // Method to initiate payment
  void startPayment(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a payment request
    final request = IamportRequest(
      merchantUid: 'unique_merchant_uid',
      amount: 10000, // Amount in the smallest currency unit
      name: 'Test Product',
      buyerName: 'John Doe',
      buyerEmail: 'john.doe@example.com',
    );

    // Start the payment process
    IamportFlutter.startPayment(request).then((result) {
      // Handle the payment result
      if (result.success) {
        // Payment was successful
        ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
          SnackBar(content: Text('Payment Successful!')),
        );
      } else {
        // Payment failed
        ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
          SnackBar(content: Text('Payment Failed: ${result.errorMsg}')),
        );
      }
    });
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Using iamport_flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:iamport_flutter/iamport_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Iamport Flutter Example',
      home: PaymentScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PaymentScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final RealFlutter realFlutter = RealFlutter();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Payment Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Start the payment process when the button is pressed
            realFlutter.startPayment(context);
          },
          child: Text('Pay Now'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter {
  // Method to initiate payment
  void startPayment(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a payment request
    final request = IamportRequest(
      merchantUid: 'unique_merchant_uid',
      amount: 10000, // Amount in the smallest currency unit
      name: 'Test Product',
      buyerName: 'John Doe',
      buyerEmail: 'john.doe@example.com',
    );

    // Start the payment process
    IamportFlutter.startPayment(request).then((result) {
      // Handle the payment result
      if (result.success) {
        // Payment was successful
        ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
          SnackBar(content: Text('Payment Successful!')),
        );
      } else {
        // Payment failed
        ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
          SnackBar(content: Text('Payment Failed: ${result.errorMsg}')),
        );
      }
    });
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The PaymentScreen widget is displayed, containing a button to initiate payment.
// 3. When the button is pressed, the startPayment method of the RealFlutter class is called.
// 4. A payment request is created with necessary details like merchant UID, amount, and buyer information.
// 5. The payment process is initiated using IamportFlutter.startPayment().
// 6. The result of the payment is handled in a callback, displaying a success or failure message accordingly.
