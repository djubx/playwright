## Using the Package

To use the `mobkit_dashed_border` package, you can wrap any widget with the `DashedBorder` widget provided by the package. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mobkit_dashed_border/mobkit_dashed_border.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Dashed Border Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: DashedBorder(
          dashPattern: [8, 4], // Dash length and gap length
          color: Colors.blue,
          child: Container(
            padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
            child: Text('Hello, Dashed Border!'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple app with a dashed border around a text widget. The `dashPattern` property allows you to customize the appearance of the border.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mobkit_dashed_border/mobkit_dashed_border.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dashed Border Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Dashed Border Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: DashedBorder(
          dashPattern: [8, 4], // Define the dash and gap lengths
          color: Colors.blue, // Set the color of the dashed border
          child: Container(
            padding: EdgeInsets.all(20), // Padding inside the dashed border
            child: Text(
              'Hello, Dashed Border!', // Text inside the container
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20), // Text style
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to RealFlutter, which is the main screen.
// 4. RealFlutter builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a DashedBorder widget is created with a specified dash pattern and color.
// 6. The DashedBorder wraps a Container that holds a Text widget, providing padding around the text.
// 7. The app displays a simple interface with a dashed border around the text, demonstrating the package's functionality.
