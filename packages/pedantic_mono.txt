   ```

2. **Install the Package**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Configure Linting**: Create or update your `analysis_options.yaml` file in the root of your project to include the pedantic rules.

   ```yaml
   include: package:pedantic_mono/analysis_options.yaml
   ```

4. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid compatibility issues.
   - **iOS**: Update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure that the platform version is compatible with the package.

   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Usage

Once the package is set up, you can start using its features in your Flutter application. The package will automatically enforce the linting rules and formatting guidelines as you write your code.

You can also run the following command to check for linting issues:

```bash
flutter analyze
```

This command will provide feedback on any issues found in your code, allowing you to address them promptly.

By following these steps, you can effectively integrate the **pedantic_mono** package into your Flutter project and start benefiting from its features.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pedantic_mono/pedantic_mono.dart'; // Importing the pedantic_mono package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the RealFlutter application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Pedantic Mono Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue, // Setting the primary color theme
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(), // Setting the home page of the app
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Pedantic Mono Demo'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Welcome to Pedantic Mono!',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24), // Text style
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between widgets
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action when button is pressed
                showDialog(
                  context: context,
                  builder: (BuildContext context) {
                    return AlertDialog(
                      title: Text('Hello!'), // Dialog title
                      content: Text('This is a demo of the pedantic_mono package.'), // Dialog content
                      actions: <Widget>[
                        TextButton(
                          child: Text('Close'), // Close button
                          onPressed: () {
                            Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                          },
                        ),
                      ],
                    );
                  },
                );
              },
              child: Text('Show Dialog'), // Button text
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to MyHomePage, which is another StatelessWidget.
// 4. MyHomePage builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget containing a Column.
// 5. The Column has a Text widget displaying a welcome message and an ElevatedButton.
// 6. When the button is pressed, it triggers a dialog to show up with a title and content.
// 7. The dialog has a close button that dismisses the dialog when pressed.
