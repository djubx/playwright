<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# flutter_flavorizr: A Comprehensive Guide

## Overview

The `flutter_flavorizr` package is a powerful tool for managing multiple flavors of a Flutter application. Flavors allow developers to create different versions of their app from a single codebase, which is particularly useful for managing different environments (like development, staging, and production) or branding (like white-label applications).

### When to Use

You should consider using `flutter_flavorizr` when:
- You need to maintain multiple versions of your app with different configurations.
- You want to streamline the build process for different environments.
- You are developing a white-label solution where the same app is customized for different clients.

### Features

- **Easy Configuration**: Define flavors in a simple configuration file.
- **Platform-Specific Customization**: Customize settings for both Android and iOS.
- **Automated Build Process**: Simplifies the build process for different flavors.
- **Environment Variables**: Manage environment-specific variables easily.

## Example Use Cases

1. **Development vs. Production**: You can create a development flavor that connects to a test API and a production flavor that connects to the live API.
2. **Branding**: If you are building a white-label app, you can create different flavors for each client, each with its own branding and configurations.

## Tutorial: Setting Up flutter_flavorizr

### Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add `flutter_flavorizr` to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  flutter_flavorizr: ^1.0.0
```

### Step 2: Create Configuration File

Create a `flavorizr.yaml` file in the root of your Flutter project. This file will define your flavors. Here’s an example configuration:

```yaml
flavors:
  development:
    app:
      name: "MyApp Dev"
      package: "com.example.myapp.dev"
      icon: "assets/icons/dev_icon.png"
    android:
      applicationId: "com.example.myapp.dev"
    ios:
      bundleId: "com.example.myapp.dev"
  production:
    app:
      name: "MyApp"
      package: "com.example.myapp"
      icon: "assets/icons/prod_icon.png"
    android:
      applicationId: "com.example.myapp"
    ios:
      bundleId: "com.example.myapp"
```

### Step 3: Run Flavorizr

After setting up your configuration, run the following command to generate the necessary files:

```bash
flutter pub run flutter_flavorizr
```

This command will create the necessary files and configurations for both Android and iOS.

### Step 4: Platform-Specific Configurations

#### Android

In your `android/app/build.gradle`, ensure that you have the following:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    flavorDimensions "version"
    productFlavors {
        development {
            dimension "version"
        }
        production {
            dimension "version"
        }
    }
}
```

#### iOS

For iOS, open your `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode and ensure that you have the correct targets set up for each flavor.

### Step 5: Build and Run

You can now build and run your app using the specified flavor:

```bash
flutter run --flavor development -t lib/main_dev.dart
```

or for production:

```bash
flutter run --flavor production -t lib/main_prod.dart
```

This command specifies which flavor to run and which main file to use.

## Complete Example: Main File

Here’s a complete example of a Flutter main file that demonstrates the use of `flutter_flavorizr`. 

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

// Main entry point for the application
void main() {
  // Run the app with the specified flavor
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// The main application class
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Return a MaterialApp widget
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Flavorizr Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

// Home screen widget
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Build the UI for the home screen
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Welcome to the Flutter Flavorizr Example!',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the main MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp widget sets up the app's title, theme, and home screen.
// 4. The HomeScreen widget is displayed as the main content of the app.
// 5. The HomeScreen contains a simple UI with a welcome message.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

### Summary of Application Flow

- The application starts at the `main()` function, which calls `runApp()` with the `RealFlutter` widget.
- The `RealFlutter` widget builds a `MaterialApp`, setting the title and theme.
- The `HomeScreen` widget is defined as the home of the app, displaying a welcome message.
- This structure allows for easy customization and scaling, especially when managing multiple flavors of the app.
