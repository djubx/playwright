# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the share_me Package

## Installation
To get started with the `share_me` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  share_me: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/share_me).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following permissions to allow sharing:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to share images.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save images.</string>
```

## Using the Package
To use the `share_me` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:share_me/share_me.dart';
```

You can then use the `ShareMe` class to initiate sharing. Here’s a simple example:

```dart
void shareText() {
  ShareMe().shareToSystem(
    text: 'Check out this amazing app!',
  );
}
```

This function will open the share dialog with the specified text.

Now that you have the package set up and know how to use it, let’s look at a complete example in the next section.

# Complete Example of Using share_me

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:share_me/share_me.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Share Me Example',
      home: ShareHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class ShareHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Share Me Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // This function is called when the button is pressed
            shareContent();
          },
          child: Text('Share Content'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void shareContent() {
    // Using the ShareMe class to share text
    ShareMe().shareToSystem(
      text: 'Check out this amazing app!',
      // You can also share images or files by providing their paths
      // imagePath: 'path/to/image.png',
      // filePath: 'path/to/file.pdf',
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home page (ShareHomePage).
// 3. ShareHomePage contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. In the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the shareContent function is called.
// 6. The shareContent function uses the ShareMe class to open the system share dialog with the specified text.
// 7. Users can then choose their preferred app to share the content.
```
