The **StatusBarManager** package for Flutter is a powerful tool designed to help developers manage the status bar in their applications effectively. This package provides a simple and intuitive API to customize the status bar's appearance and behavior, making it easier to create visually appealing and user-friendly applications.

## When to Use StatusBarManager

You might consider using the StatusBarManager package in scenarios such as:

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using StatusBarManager

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the StatusBarManager package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the StatusBarManager package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  statusbarmanager: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, you may need to modify the `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`. Ensure that you have the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to ensure that your app's `Info.plist` file includes the following key to allow status bar customization:

```xml
<key>UIViewControllerBasedStatusBarAppearance</key>
<false/>
```

## Step 3: Using StatusBarManager

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to change the status bar color and hide it.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:statusbarmanager/statusbarmanager.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Set the status bar color to blue
    StatusBarManager.setColor(Colors.blue);

    // Hide the status bar
    StatusBarManager.hide();

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('StatusBarManager Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Hello, StatusBarManager!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we import the necessary packages, set the status bar color to blue, and hide the status bar. The main application consists of a simple `Scaffold` with an `AppBar` and a centered text widget.

# Complete Example of StatusBarManager

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:statusbarmanager/statusbarmanager.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Set the status bar color to blue
    StatusBarManager.setColor(Colors.blue);

    // Hide the status bar
    StatusBarManager.hide();

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('StatusBarManager Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Show the status bar when the button is pressed
              StatusBarManager.show();
            },
            child: Text('Show Status Bar'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. Inside the RealFlutter widget, we set the status bar color to blue using StatusBarManager.setColor().
// 3. We hide the status bar initially using StatusBarManager.hide().
// 4. The MaterialApp widget is created with a Scaffold that contains an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. The Center widget contains an ElevatedButton that, when pressed, calls StatusBarManager.show() to display the status bar again.
// 6. This demonstrates how to dynamically control the visibility of the status bar based on user interaction.
