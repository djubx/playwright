# Tutorial: Setting Up the Video Uploader Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **video_uploader** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **video_uploader** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  video_uploader: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the required permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to upload videos.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to record videos.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone to record audio with videos.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Video Uploader Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement video uploading functionality.

# Complete Example: Video Uploader in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:video_uploader/video_uploader.dart'; // Import the video uploader package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Video Uploader Example',
      home: VideoUploaderScreen(), // Set the home screen to VideoUploaderScreen
    );
  }
}

class VideoUploaderScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _VideoUploaderScreenState createState() => _VideoUploaderScreenState();
}

class _VideoUploaderScreenState extends State<VideoUploaderScreen> {
  String? _uploadStatus; // Variable to hold the upload status

  // Function to handle video upload
  Future<void> _uploadVideo(String videoPath) async {
    // Start the upload process
    VideoUploader.upload(videoPath, 'https://your-upload-url.com/upload').then((response) {
      // Handle successful upload
      setState(() {
        _uploadStatus = 'Upload successful: ${response.status}';
      });
    }).catchError((error) {
      // Handle upload error
      setState(() {
        _uploadStatus = 'Upload failed: $error';
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Video Uploader'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Simulate video selection and upload
                String videoPath = '/path/to/your/video.mp4'; // Replace with actual video path
                _uploadVideo(videoPath); // Call the upload function
              },
              child: Text('Upload Video'), // Button to trigger video upload
            ),
            if (_uploadStatus != null) // Display upload status if available
              Padding(
                padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
                child: Text(_uploadStatus!),
              ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up a MaterialApp with a title and home screen.
// 3. The VideoUploaderScreen is displayed, which contains a button to upload a video.
// 4. When the button is pressed, it simulates selecting a video and calls the _uploadVideo function.
// 5. The _uploadVideo function uses the VideoUploader.upload method to upload the video to the specified URL.
// 6. Upon success or failure, the upload status is updated and displayed on the screen.
```

In this blog, we have covered the **video_uploader** Flutter package, including its description, setup tutorial, and a complete example. The application flow is straightforward: it initializes the app, allows users to upload a video, and displays the upload status. This package simplifies the integration of video uploading features in Flutter applications, making it a valuable tool for developers.
