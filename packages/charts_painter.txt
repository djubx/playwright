# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Charts Painter

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **charts_painter** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and include the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  charts_painter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/charts_painter).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:charts_painter/charts_painter.dart';
```

## Step 4: Creating a Simple Chart

You can now create a simple chart by using the `RealFlutter` class. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to set up a line chart:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:charts_painter/charts_painter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Charts Painter Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: LineChart(
          data: [
            DataPoint(x: 1, y: 2),
            DataPoint(x: 2, y: 3),
            DataPoint(x: 3, y: 5),
            DataPoint(x: 4, y: 4),
          ],
          // Additional chart properties can be set here
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic line chart with four data points. You can customize the chart further by adjusting its properties.

# Complete Example of Charts Painter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:charts_painter/charts_painter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Charts Painter Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Charts Painter Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: LineChart(
          data: [
            DataPoint(x: 1, y: 2), // First data point
            DataPoint(x: 2, y: 3), // Second data point
            DataPoint(x: 3, y: 5), // Third data point
            DataPoint(x: 4, y: 4), // Fourth data point
          ],
          // Customize the chart's appearance
          lineColor: Colors.blue,
          pointColor: Colors.red,
          pointSize: 8.0,
          // Add more customization options as needed
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a LineChart is created with a list of DataPoints.
// 5. Each DataPoint represents a point on the chart, defined by its x and y values.
// 6. The chart is customized with colors and sizes for the line and points.
// 7. The app displays the line chart in the center of the screen.
```
