# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Video Viewer Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **video_viewer** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  video_viewer: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/video_viewer).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions for internet access if you are streaming videos from the web. Add the following lines inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add the following key to your `Info.plist` file to allow video playback from the internet:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Video Viewer Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the **video_viewer** package in your app.

# Complete Example of Using the Video Viewer Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:video_viewer/video_viewer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Video Viewer Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: VideoViewerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class VideoViewerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _VideoViewerScreenState createState() => _VideoViewerScreenState();
}

class _VideoViewerScreenState extends State<VideoViewerScreen> {
  // URL of the video to be played
  final String videoUrl = 'https://www.example.com/sample_video.mp4';
  
  // Controller for the video viewer
  late VideoViewerController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the video viewer controller
    _controller = VideoViewerController.network(videoUrl);
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the controller when the widget is removed from the widget tree
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Video Viewer Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: VideoViewer(
          controller: _controller,
          // Optional: Customize the video viewer's aspect ratio
          aspectRatio: 16 / 9,
          // Optional: Show controls
          showControls: true,
          // Optional: Callback for when the video completes
          onVideoComplete: () {
            // Show a message when the video finishes playing
            ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
              SnackBar(content: Text('Video playback completed!')),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme, and sets VideoViewerScreen as the home widget.
// 3. VideoViewerScreen is a StatefulWidget that manages the video playback state.
// 4. In the initState method, a VideoViewerController is created with the video URL.
// 5. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a centered VideoViewer widget.
// 6. The VideoViewer widget uses the controller to play the video and provides options for customization.
// 7. When the video completes, a SnackBar message is displayed to inform the user.
```
