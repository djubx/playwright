# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Chat Message Timestamp Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `chat_message_timestamp` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  chat_message_timestamp: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` file to allow for background processing if your app requires it. Add the following key:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>fetch</string>
</array>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:chat_message_timestamp/chat_message_timestamp.dart';
```

2. Use the `ChatMessageTimestamp` widget in your chat message UI:

```dart
ChatMessageTimestamp(
  timestamp: DateTime.now(), // Pass the message timestamp
  format: TimestampFormat.relative, // Choose the format
),
```

This will display the timestamp in a relative format (e.g., "2 minutes ago"). You can customize the format as needed.

With these steps, you are now ready to implement the `chat_message_timestamp` package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Using the Chat Message Timestamp Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:chat_message_timestamp/chat_message_timestamp.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Chat Message Timestamp Example',
      home: ChatScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ChatScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Chat Messages'),
      ),
      body: ListView(
        children: [
          // Example chat message with timestamp
          ListTile(
            title: Text('Hello! How are you?'),
            subtitle: ChatMessageTimestamp(
              timestamp: DateTime.now().subtract(Duration(minutes: 5)), // 5 minutes ago
              format: TimestampFormat.relative, // Display as relative time
            ),
          ),
          ListTile(
            title: Text('I am fine, thank you!'),
            subtitle: ChatMessageTimestamp(
              timestamp: DateTime.now().subtract(Duration(minutes: 2)), // 2 minutes ago
              format: TimestampFormat.relative, // Display as relative time
            ),
          ),
          ListTile(
            title: Text('What about you?'),
            subtitle: ChatMessageTimestamp(
              timestamp: DateTime.now(), // Current time
              format: TimestampFormat.relative, // Display as relative time
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (ChatScreen).
// 3. ChatScreen contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a ListView to display chat messages.
// 4. Each ListTile represents a chat message, with the message text and a timestamp.
// 5. The ChatMessageTimestamp widget is used to display the timestamp for each message.
// 6. The timestamps are displayed in a relative format, showing how long ago each message was sent.
```
