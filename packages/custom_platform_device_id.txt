# Understanding the `custom_platform_device_id` Flutter Package

The `custom_platform_device_id` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers who need to retrieve a unique identifier for the device on which their application is running. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to track user sessions, manage device-specific settings, or implement device-based licensing.

## When to Use

- **User Tracking**: When you need to track user sessions or activities across different devices.
- **Device-Specific Settings**: To store and retrieve settings that are specific to a device.
- **Licensing**: Implementing device-based licensing for your application.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Unique Device ID**: Provides a unique identifier for each device.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that can be easily integrated into existing Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `custom_platform_device_id`

In this section, we will walk through the process of setting up and using the `custom_platform_device_id` package in a Flutter application.

## Setup Process

### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the `custom_platform_device_id` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  custom_platform_device_id: ^1.0.0
```

### Step 2: Install the Package

Run the following command to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android

1. Open the `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

#### iOS

1. Open the `ios/Podfile`.
2. Ensure that the platform is set to at least iOS 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

3. Run the following command to update the iOS dependencies:

```bash
cd ios
pod install
```

## Using the Package

To use the `custom_platform_device_id` package, you need to import it into your Dart file and call the appropriate methods to retrieve the device ID.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:custom_platform_device_id/custom_platform_device_id.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Device ID Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: DeviceIdScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class DeviceIdScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DeviceIdScreenState createState() => _DeviceIdScreenState();
}

class _DeviceIdScreenState extends State<DeviceIdScreen> {
  String _deviceId = 'Unknown';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _fetchDeviceId();
  }

  // Fetches the device ID using the custom_platform_device_id package
  Future<void> _fetchDeviceId() async {
    String deviceId;
    try {
      // Attempt to get the device ID
      deviceId = await CustomPlatformDeviceId.getDeviceId() ?? 'Unknown device ID';
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during the fetch
      deviceId = 'Failed to get device ID: $e';
    }

    // Update the state with the fetched device ID
    if (!mounted) return;
    setState(() {
      _deviceId = deviceId;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Device ID Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Device ID: $_deviceId'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow:
// 1. The application starts by running the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a home screen of DeviceIdScreen.
// 3. DeviceIdScreen is a stateful widget that initializes by calling _fetchDeviceId.
// 4. _fetchDeviceId uses the CustomPlatformDeviceId package to retrieve the device ID.
// 5. The device ID is fetched asynchronously and stored in the _deviceId state variable.
// 6. The UI is updated to display the device ID once it is retrieved.
// 7. If an error occurs during the fetch, an error message is displayed instead.
