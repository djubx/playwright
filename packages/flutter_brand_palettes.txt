# Complete Example of Using `flutter_brand_palettes`

Below is a complete Flutter application demonstrating the use of the `flutter_brand_palettes` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_brand_palettes/flutter_brand_palettes.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Brand Palettes Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: BrandPaletteDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class BrandPaletteDemo extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Fetching the primary brand color for Facebook
    Color facebookPrimary = RealFlutter.getBrandColor('facebook', BrandColor.primary);

    // Fetching the secondary brand color for Google
    Color googleSecondary = RealFlutter.getBrandColor('google', BrandColor.secondary);

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Brand Palettes Demo'),
        backgroundColor: facebookPrimary, // Using Facebook's primary color
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Facebook Primary Color',
              style: TextStyle(color: facebookPrimary),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(
              'Google Secondary Color',
              style: TextStyle(color: googleSecondary),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// Application Flow Explanation
// The application starts with the `main` function, which calls `runApp` with `MyApp`.
// `MyApp` is a stateless widget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// The home of the app is set to `BrandPaletteDemo`, another stateless widget.
// In `BrandPaletteDemo`, we use the `RealFlutter` class to fetch brand colors for Facebook and Google.
// The `AppBar` uses Facebook's primary color, and the text widgets display colors from Facebook and Google.
// This demonstrates how to integrate and use brand colors in a Flutter application.
