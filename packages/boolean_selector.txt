Here's a detailed technical blog on the "boolean_selector" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Boolean Selector Flutter Package

The **boolean_selector** Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to simplify the management of boolean values in your Flutter applications. It provides a user-friendly interface for selecting boolean options, making it ideal for scenarios where users need to toggle between two states, such as on/off switches, yes/no questions, or any binary choice.

## When to Use

You might consider using the **boolean_selector** package in the following scenarios:

- **Settings Screens**: When you need to allow users to enable or disable features in your app.
- **Forms**: For binary questions where users can select either "Yes" or "No."
- **Filters**: In applications that require users to filter data based on boolean conditions.

## Features

- **Customizable UI**: The package allows for extensive customization of the selector's appearance.
- **Easy Integration**: It can be easily integrated into existing Flutter applications with minimal setup.
- **Reactive State Management**: The boolean selector updates its state reactively, ensuring that the UI reflects the current state without additional boilerplate code.

Overall, the **boolean_selector** package enhances user experience by providing a straightforward way to handle boolean selections in Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Boolean Selector Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **boolean_selector** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  boolean_selector: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Boolean Selector

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the boolean selector in your app:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:boolean_selector/boolean_selector.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  bool _isSelected = false; // Initial state

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Boolean Selector Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: BooleanSelector(
          value: _isSelected,
          onChanged: (value) {
            setState(() {
              _isSelected = value; // Update state on selection change
            });
          },
          trueText: 'Enabled', // Text for true state
          falseText: 'Disabled', // Text for false state
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple app with a boolean selector that toggles between "Enabled" and "Disabled." The state is managed using a boolean variable `_isSelected`, which updates whenever the user interacts with the selector.

# Complete Example of Boolean Selector in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:boolean_selector/boolean_selector.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  bool _isSelected = false; // Step 1: Initialize the boolean state

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Boolean Selector Example'), // Step 2: App title
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: BooleanSelector(
            value: _isSelected, // Step 3: Bind the selector to the state
            onChanged: (value) {
              setState(() {
                _isSelected = value; // Step 4: Update state on change
              });
            },
            trueText: 'Enabled', // Step 5: Text for true state
            falseText: 'Disabled', // Step 6: Text for false state
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// Step 1: The app starts by initializing the boolean state (_isSelected) to false.
// Step 2: The app bar displays the title "Boolean Selector Example."
// Step 3: The BooleanSelector widget is created, binding its value to _isSelected.
// Step 4: When the user toggles the selector, the onChanged callback updates the state.
// Step 5: If the selector is true, "Enabled" is displayed; if false, "Disabled" is shown.
// Step 6: The UI updates reactively, reflecting the current state of the boolean selector.

In summary, this blog post provided a comprehensive overview of the **boolean_selector** Flutter package, including its features, setup instructions, and a complete example. The application flow is straightforward: it initializes a boolean state, displays a selector, and updates the UI based on user interaction, demonstrating the package's ease of use and effectiveness in managing boolean values in Flutter applications.
