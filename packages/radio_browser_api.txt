# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using radio_browser_api

## Installation
To get started with the `radio_browser_api` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  radio_browser_api: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/radio_browser_api).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `Info.plist` to allow network requests:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Using the Package
Once you have installed the package and configured your project, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to fetch and display radio stations.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:radio_browser_api/radio_browser_api.dart';
```

2. Create an instance of the `RadioBrowserApi` class and use its methods to fetch data.

```dart
final radioApi = RadioBrowserApi();
```

3. Use the methods provided by the package to search for stations and play streams.

This setup will allow you to access the radio stations and implement the desired functionality in your app.

# Complete Example of Using radio_browser_api

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:radio_browser_api/radio_browser_api.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Create an instance of the RadioBrowserApi
  final RadioBrowserApi radioApi = RadioBrowserApi();
  List<RadioStation> stations = []; // List to hold fetched radio stations
  bool isLoading = true; // Loading state indicator

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    fetchStations(); // Fetch stations when the app starts
  }

  // Function to fetch radio stations
  Future<void> fetchStations() async {
    try {
      // Fetch the list of radio stations
      stations = await radioApi.getStations();
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during fetching
      print("Error fetching stations: $e");
    } finally {
      // Update the loading state
      setState(() {
        isLoading = false; // Set loading to false once data is fetched
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Radio Browser API Example'), // App title
        ),
        body: isLoading
            ? Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator()) // Show loading indicator
            : ListView.builder(
                itemCount: stations.length, // Number of stations
                itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                  final station = stations[index]; // Get the station
                  return ListTile(
                    title: Text(station.name), // Display station name
                    subtitle: Text(station.country), // Display station country
                    onTap: () {
                      // Handle station selection
                      // Here you would typically start streaming the selected station
                      print('Selected station: ${station.name}');
                    },
                  );
                },
              ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application that uses the radio_browser_api package to fetch and display a list of radio stations. 

// 1. The app starts by creating an instance of the RadioBrowserApi class.
// 2. In the initState method, it calls fetchStations to retrieve the list of radio stations.
// 3. The fetchStations method uses the getStations method from the radioApi instance to fetch the data asynchronously.
// 4. While the data is being fetched, a loading indicator is displayed.
// 5. Once the data is fetched, the loading state is updated, and the ListView.builder is used to display the list of stations.
// 6. Each station is displayed as a ListTile, showing its name and country. Tapping on a station would typically initiate streaming (not implemented in this example).

// This example provides a basic structure for integrating the radio_browser_api package into a Flutter application, allowing for further enhancements and features to be added as needed.
