# Understanding the `reading_time` Flutter Package

The `reading_time` package is a simple yet powerful tool for Flutter developers who want to estimate the time it takes to read a given text. This package is particularly useful for applications that display articles, blogs, or any lengthy text content, providing users with an estimated reading time to help them manage their reading schedule better.

## When to Use the `reading_time` Package

- **Content-Heavy Applications**: Apps that display articles, blogs, or news can benefit from showing users how long it might take to read a piece of content.
- **E-Readers**: Applications that serve as e-readers can use this package to enhance user experience by providing reading time estimates.
- **Educational Apps**: Apps that provide learning materials can use reading time estimates to help users plan their study sessions.

## Features

- **Simple API**: The package provides a straightforward API to calculate reading time.
- **Customizable Reading Speed**: You can adjust the words-per-minute (WPM) rate to match different reading speeds.
- **Locale Support**: It supports different locales, allowing for more accurate reading time estimates based on language.

# Setting Up and Using the `reading_time` Package

In this section, we'll walk through the setup process for the `reading_time` package and demonstrate how to integrate it into a Flutter application.

## Setup Process

1. **Add Dependency**: First, add the `reading_time` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     reading_time: ^0.1.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run `flutter pub get` to install the new package.

3. **Import the Package**: Import the package in your Dart file where you intend to use it.

   ```dart
   import 'package:reading_time/reading_time.dart';
   ```

## Platform-Specific Details

The `reading_time` package is platform-agnostic, meaning it works seamlessly across Android and iOS without any additional platform-specific configurations. However, ensure your Flutter environment is set up correctly for both platforms by following the official Flutter setup guides for [Android](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) and [iOS](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/macos).

## Using the Package

To use the `reading_time` package, you simply need to call its main function with the text you want to analyze. Here's a basic example:

```dart
final readingTime = readingTimeFromString('Your text here');
print('Estimated reading time: ${readingTime.minutes} minutes');
```

You can customize the words-per-minute (WPM) rate by passing an additional parameter:

```dart
final readingTime = readingTimeFromString('Your text here', wordsPerMinute: 200);
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:reading_time/reading_time.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutterApp());
}

class RealFlutterApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Reading Time Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: ReadingTimeHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class ReadingTimeHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  final String sampleText = "Flutter is Google's UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.";

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Calculate the reading time for the sample text
    final readingTime = readingTimeFromString(sampleText);

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Reading Time Example'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Sample Text:',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 10),
            Text(sampleText),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(
              'Estimated Reading Time: ${readingTime.minutes} minutes',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18, color: Colors.green),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow:
// 1. The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutterApp`.
// 2. `RealFlutterApp` is a stateless widget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home of the app is set to `ReadingTimeHomePage`, another stateless widget.
// 4. `ReadingTimeHomePage` contains a sample text and calculates its reading time using the `reading_time` package.
// 5. The reading time is displayed on the screen along with the sample text.
// 6. The UI consists of a simple column layout with text widgets to show the sample text and its estimated reading time.
