# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Holdable Button Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the **holdable_button** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  holdable_button: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Holdable Button
Now that you have the package installed, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a holdable button.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:holdable_button/holdable_button.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Holdable Button Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: HoldableButton(
            onHold: () {
              // Action to perform on hold
              print('Button is being held!');
            },
            onRelease: () {
              // Action to perform on release
              print('Button released!');
            },
            duration: Duration(milliseconds: 500), // Duration to hold
            child: Container(
              padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
              color: Colors.blue,
              child: Text(
                'Hold Me!',
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code
- **HoldableButton**: This is the main widget that wraps around the button's child widget.
- **onHold**: A callback that is triggered when the button is held down.
- **onRelease**: A callback that is triggered when the button is released.
- **duration**: Specifies how long the button must be held before the `onHold` action is triggered.
- **child**: The widget that will be displayed as the button.

With this setup, you can now create interactive buttons that respond to hold actions, enhancing the user experience in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Holdable Button in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:holdable_button/holdable_button.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Holdable Button Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: HoldableButton(
            onHold: () {
              // Action to perform on hold
              print('Button is being held!'); // Log message for hold action
            },
            onRelease: () {
              // Action to perform on release
              print('Button released!'); // Log message for release action
            },
            duration: Duration(milliseconds: 500), // Duration to hold
            child: Container(
              padding: EdgeInsets.all(20), // Padding around the button
              color: Colors.blue, // Background color of the button
              child: Text(
                'Hold Me!', // Text displayed on the button
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20), // Text style
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, a HoldableButton is created.
// 4. The HoldableButton has two callbacks: onHold and onRelease.
// 5. When the button is held for 500 milliseconds, the onHold callback is triggered, logging a message.
// 6. When the button is released, the onRelease callback is triggered, logging another message.
// 7. The button is styled with padding, a blue background, and white text, making it visually appealing.
