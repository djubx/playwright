# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Crisp Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the Crisp package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the Crisp package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  crisp: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following lines inside the `<application>` tag:

```xml
<application>
    ...
    <meta-data
        android:name="com.crisp.apiKey"
        android:value="YOUR_API_KEY" /> <!-- Replace with your Crisp API key -->
</application>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` file. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Crisp Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to display a notification using the Crisp package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:crisp/crisp.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Crisp Notification Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Crisp Notifications'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Display a success notification
            Crisp.show(
              context: context,
              message: 'This is a success notification!',
              type: NotificationType.success,
            );
          },
          child: Text('Show Notification'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with a button that, when pressed, displays a success notification.

# Complete Example of the Crisp Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:crisp/crisp.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Crisp Notification Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Crisp Notifications'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Display a success notification
            Crisp.show(
              context: context,
              message: 'This is a success notification!',
              type: NotificationType.success,
            );
          },
          child: Text('Show Notification'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget contains an AppBar and a centered button.
// 4. When the button is pressed, it triggers the Crisp.show method to display a success notification.
// 5. The notification appears at the top of the screen, informing the user of the success message.
```

In this blog, we explored the Crisp Flutter package, detailing its features, setup process, and providing a complete example. The application flow is straightforward: it initializes the app, displays a button, and shows a notification when the button is pressed. This package is a great addition to any Flutter application that requires effective user notifications.
