# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Spelling Number Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **spelling_number** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  spelling_number: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Here’s a simple example of how to use the **spelling_number** package to convert numbers to words.

1. Import the package in your Dart file.
2. Create an instance of the `SpellingNumber` class.
3. Call the `spell` method with the number you want to convert.

Here’s a sample code snippet:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:spelling_number/spelling_number.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Spelling Number Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(
            SpellingNumber().spell(12345),
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code will display "twelve thousand three hundred forty-five" in the center of the screen.

## Conclusion

The **spelling_number** package is easy to set up and use, making it a great addition to any Flutter project that requires number-to-word conversion. With its simple API and robust functionality, you can enhance the user experience in your applications significantly.

# Complete Example of Using the Spelling Number Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart'; // Importing Flutter material package for UI components
import 'package:spelling_number/spelling_number.dart'; // Importing the spelling_number package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the RealFlutter app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Spelling Number Example', // Title of the application
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Spelling Number Example'), // AppBar title
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center, // Centering the content
            children: <Widget>[
              Text(
                'Number: 12345', // Displaying the number
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24), // Text style
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between texts
              Text(
                'Spelled Out: ${SpellingNumber().spell(12345)}', // Converting number to words
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24), // Text style
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that centers its child.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange two Text widgets vertically.
// 5. The first Text widget displays the number "12345".
// 6. The second Text widget calls the spell method from the SpellingNumber class to convert the number to words and displays it.
// 7. The app presents a simple interface showing both the number and its spelled-out version.
