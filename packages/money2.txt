# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Money2 Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **money2** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  money2: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` to allow for network requests if you plan to fetch currency conversion rates from an API.

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Money2 Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to create and manipulate monetary values.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:money2/money2.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Money2 Example',
      home: MoneyExample(),
    );
  }
}

class MoneyExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Define a currency
    final usd = Currency.create('USD', 2, symbol: r'\$');

    // Create monetary values
    final amount1 = Money.fromInt(1000, usd); // $10.00
    final amount2 = Money.fromInt(2500, usd); // $25.00

    // Perform arithmetic operations
    final total = amount1 + amount2; // $35.00

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Money2 Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Total: ${total.toString()}',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we define a currency (USD), create monetary values, and perform arithmetic operations. The result is displayed in the app's UI.

# Complete Example of Money2 Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:money2/money2.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Money2 Example',
      home: MoneyExample(),
    );
  }
}

class MoneyExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Define a currency (USD)
    final usd = Currency.create('USD', 2, symbol: r'\$');

    // Create monetary values
    final amount1 = Money.fromInt(1000, usd); // $10.00
    final amount2 = Money.fromInt(2500, usd); // $25.00

    // Perform arithmetic operations
    final total = amount1 + amount2; // $35.00

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Money2 Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Total: ${total.toString()}', // Display the total amount
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget (MoneyExample).
// 3. MoneyExample builds the UI, defining a currency (USD) and creating two monetary values.
// 4. It performs an addition operation on the two monetary values to get the total.
// 5. The total is displayed in the center of the screen using a Text widget.
```
