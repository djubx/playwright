// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user opens the app and is presented with a payment widget.
// 2. The user selects a payment method (e.g. credit card) and enters their payment information.
// 3. The Toss Payments SDK tokenizes the payment information and sends it to the Toss Payments server for processing.
// 4. The Toss Payments server processes the payment and returns a payment result to the app.
// 5. The app receives the payment result and handles it accordingly (e.g. displays a success message or error message).

// Note: This is a simplified example and you should handle errors and edge cases more robustly in a real-world application.
