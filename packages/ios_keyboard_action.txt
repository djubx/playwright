<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# iOS Keyboard Action Flutter Package

The `ios_keyboard_action` Flutter package is designed to enhance the user experience by providing customizable keyboard actions for iOS applications. This package allows developers to easily manage keyboard visibility and actions, making it easier to create responsive and user-friendly forms and input fields.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `ios_keyboard_action` package in scenarios where:
- You need to manage keyboard visibility dynamically based on user interactions.
- You want to customize the keyboard's return key action (e.g., changing it from "Done" to "Next").
- You are developing forms that require a smooth transition between input fields.

## Features

- **Customizable Keyboard Actions**: Change the return key action to suit your application's needs.
- **Keyboard Visibility Management**: Control when the keyboard appears and disappears based on user interactions.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: While primarily focused on iOS, it can be integrated into Flutter applications that target multiple platforms.

By leveraging this package, developers can create a more intuitive and seamless user experience in their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the iOS Keyboard Action Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `ios_keyboard_action` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ios_keyboard_action: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/ios_keyboard_action).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, ensure that your app's `Info.plist` file includes the following configuration to allow keyboard actions:

```xml
<key>UIKeyboardAppearance</key>
<string>UIKeyboardAppearanceLight</string>
```

This setting allows you to customize the keyboard appearance, which can enhance the user experience.

### Android Configuration

While the package is primarily focused on iOS, you can still use it in Android applications. However, ensure that your Android project is set up correctly to support Flutter.

## Step 3: Using the Package

To use the `ios_keyboard_action` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:ios_keyboard_action/ios_keyboard_action.dart';
```

You can then create a form with customizable keyboard actions. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ios_keyboard_action/ios_keyboard_action.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('iOS Keyboard Action Example')),
        body: KeyboardAction(
          child: MyForm(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MyForm extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyFormState createState() => _MyFormState();
}

class _MyFormState extends State<MyForm> {
  final _controller = TextEditingController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
      child: Column(
        children: [
          TextField(
            controller: _controller,
            decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter text'),
            textInputAction: TextInputAction.next, // Change the action to 'Next'
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20),
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Handle button press
              print('Button pressed: ${_controller.text}');
            },
            child: Text('Submit'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple form with a text field and a submit button. The text field's return key is set to "Next," allowing users to navigate to the next input field seamlessly.

# Complete Example of the iOS Keyboard Action Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ios_keyboard_action/ios_keyboard_action.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('iOS Keyboard Action Example')),
        body: KeyboardAction(
          child: MyForm(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MyForm extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyFormState createState() => _MyFormState();
}

class _MyFormState extends State<MyForm> {
  final _controller = TextEditingController(); // Controller for the text field

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0), // Padding around the form
      child: Column(
        children: [
          TextField(
            controller: _controller, // Assigning the controller to the text field
            decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter text'), // Label for the text field
            textInputAction: TextInputAction.next, // Set the return key action to 'Next'
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between the text field and button
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Action to perform when the button is pressed
              print('Button pressed: ${_controller.text}'); // Print the text entered
            },
            child: Text('Submit'), // Button label
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which sets up the MaterialApp and Scaffold.
// 2. The KeyboardAction widget wraps the MyForm widget, enabling keyboard action management.
// 3. The MyForm widget contains a TextField and a button.
// 4. The TextField uses a TextEditingController to manage its input.
// 5. The return key on the keyboard is set to 'Next', allowing users to navigate easily.
// 6. When the button is pressed, the text from the TextField is printed to the console.
```
