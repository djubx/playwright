# Zebra Scanner Plugin: Setup and Usage Tutorial

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the zebra_scanner_plugin and provide detailed instructions on how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Installation

To add the zebra_scanner_plugin to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  zebra_scanner_plugin: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/zebra_scanner_plugin).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. **Permissions**: Ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

2. **Zebra SDK**: You may need to include the Zebra SDK in your project. Follow the instructions provided in the Zebra documentation for integrating their SDK.

### iOS
1. **Permissions**: Add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file to request camera access:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the camera for scanning barcodes.</string>
```

2. **Zebra SDK**: Similar to Android, ensure that you have the Zebra SDK integrated as per their guidelines.

## Basic Usage

To use the zebra_scanner_plugin, you can follow these steps in your Flutter application:

1. Import the package:

```dart
import 'package:zebra_scanner_plugin/zebra_scanner_plugin.dart';
```

2. Initialize the scanner and start scanning:

```dart
void startScanning() async {
  // Initialize the scanner
  final scanner = ZebraScannerPlugin();

  // Start scanning
  scanner.startScan().listen((barcode) {
    // Handle the scanned barcode
    print('Scanned barcode: $barcode');
  });
}
```

This basic setup will allow you to start scanning barcodes and handle the scanned data accordingly.

# Complete Example of Zebra Scanner Plugin

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:zebra_scanner_plugin/zebra_scanner_plugin.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String scannedBarcode = ''; // Variable to hold the scanned barcode

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    startScanning(); // Start scanning when the app initializes
  }

  void startScanning() async {
    final scanner = ZebraScannerPlugin(); // Create an instance of the scanner

    // Start listening for scanned barcodes
    scanner.startScan().listen((barcode) {
      setState(() {
        scannedBarcode = barcode; // Update the scanned barcode
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Zebra Scanner Example'), // App title
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text(
                'Scanned Barcode:', // Label for the scanned barcode
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              Text(
                scannedBarcode.isEmpty ? 'No barcode scanned yet' : scannedBarcode, // Display the scanned barcode
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the initState method, the startScanning function is called to initialize the scanner.
// 3. The scanner listens for scanned barcodes and updates the scannedBarcode variable when a barcode is detected.
// 4. The UI displays the scanned barcode or a message indicating that no barcode has been scanned yet.
// 5. The app provides real-time feedback as barcodes are scanned, making it suitable for inventory or retail applications.
