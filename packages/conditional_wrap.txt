# Understanding the `conditional_wrap` Flutter Package

The `conditional_wrap` package is a versatile Flutter utility that allows developers to conditionally wrap a widget with another widget. This package is particularly useful when you want to apply a wrapper widget only under certain conditions, thus keeping your widget tree clean and efficient.

## When to Use `conditional_wrap`

Consider using `conditional_wrap` in scenarios where you need to apply a widget, such as a `Padding`, `Container`, or any other decorator, based on a condition. For example, you might want to add padding around a widget only if a certain condition is met, or wrap a widget with a `GestureDetector` only when a specific flag is true.

## Key Features

- **Conditional Wrapping**: Wraps a widget with another widget based on a boolean condition.
- **Customizable**: Allows you to define the widget to wrap with, providing flexibility in UI design.
- **Simplifies Code**: Reduces the need for complex conditional logic in the widget tree.

# Setting Up and Using `conditional_wrap` in Flutter

In this section, we'll walk through the setup process for the `conditional_wrap` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter project.

## Setup Process

1. **Add Dependency**: First, add the `conditional_wrap` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     conditional_wrap: ^1.0.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run `flutter pub get` to install the new package.

3. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the package:

   ```dart
   import 'package:conditional_wrap/conditional_wrap.dart';
   ```

## Platform-Specific Details

The `conditional_wrap` package is platform-agnostic, meaning it works seamlessly across both Android and iOS without any additional platform-specific configurations. However, ensure your Flutter environment is set up correctly for both platforms by following the official Flutter setup guide.

## Using `conditional_wrap`

Here's a simple example of how to use `conditional_wrap`:

```dart
ConditionalWrap(
  condition: true, // The condition to evaluate
  wrapper: (child) => Padding(
    padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
    child: child,
  ),
  child: RealFlutter(), // Your main widget
)
```

In this example, the `RealFlutter` widget is wrapped with a `Padding` widget only if the condition is `true`.

# Complete Example of Using `conditional_wrap`

Below is a complete Flutter application demonstrating the use of the `conditional_wrap` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:conditional_wrap/conditional_wrap.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Conditional Wrap Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Conditional Wrap Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: RealFlutter(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    bool shouldWrap = true; // Condition to determine wrapping

    return ConditionalWrap(
      condition: shouldWrap, // Check if the widget should be wrapped
      wrapper: (child) => Container(
        padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        color: Colors.blueAccent,
        child: child,
      ),
      child: Text(
        'Hello, Flutter!',
        style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.white),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The `main` function initializes the app and sets up the `MyApp` widget.
// `MyApp` is a stateless widget that builds the main structure of the app.
// It uses a `MaterialApp` to provide material design styling.
// The `Scaffold` widget provides a basic structure with an `AppBar` and a `Center` widget.
// Inside the `Center` widget, the `RealFlutter` widget is used.
// `RealFlutter` is another stateless widget that uses `ConditionalWrap`.
// The `ConditionalWrap` widget checks the `shouldWrap` condition.
// If `shouldWrap` is true, it wraps the `Text` widget with a `Container`.
// The `Container` adds padding and a background color to the `Text` widget.
// If `shouldWrap` is false, the `Text` widget is displayed without any wrapping.
