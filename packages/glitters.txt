# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Glitters Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the Glitters package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  glitters: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Glitters Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a glitter effect on a button.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:glitters/glitters.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Glitters Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: GlitterButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Action when button is pressed
              print('Glitter Button Pressed!');
            },
            child: Text('Click Me!', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white)),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with a button that has a glitter effect. The `GlitterButton` widget is used to wrap the button text, providing the desired visual effect.

# Complete Example of Glitters Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:glitters/glitters.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Glitters Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Center widget to align the button in the middle of the screen
          child: GlitterButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Action when button is pressed
              print('Glitter Button Pressed!');
            },
            child: Text('Click Me!', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white)),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  // Entry point of the application
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the Flutter application.
// 2. The runApp function takes the RealFlutter widget and makes it the root of the widget tree.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp, which provides the app structure.
// 4. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold widget is created, which provides the basic visual layout structure.
// 5. An AppBar is added to the Scaffold with the title 'Glitters Example'.
// 6. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget, which centers its child widget.
// 7. The child of the Center widget is a GlitterButton, which is a custom button with a glitter effect.
// 8. When the button is pressed, it triggers the onPressed callback, printing a message to the console.
```
