Here's a detailed technical blog on the "delta_e" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Delta_E Flutter Package

The `delta_e` Flutter package is a powerful tool for color manipulation and comparison in Flutter applications. It provides a straightforward way to calculate the difference between two colors using the Delta E formula, which is widely used in color science to quantify the difference between colors. This package is particularly useful in applications that require precise color matching, such as design tools, image processing apps, and any application where color accuracy is critical.

## When to Use Delta_E

You might consider using the `delta_e` package in scenarios such as:
- **Design Applications**: When creating tools for designers that require accurate color comparisons.
- **Image Processing**: In applications that manipulate images and need to ensure color fidelity.
- **Quality Control**: For applications in manufacturing where color consistency is essential.

## Features

- **Color Difference Calculation**: Easily compute the difference between two colors using various Delta E formulas (e.g., Delta E 1976, Delta E 1994, Delta E 2000).
- **Support for Various Color Spaces**: The package supports RGB, HSL, and other color formats, making it versatile for different use cases.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate into existing Flutter applications with minimal setup.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Delta_E

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `delta_e` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  delta_e: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the platform version in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the package as follows:

```dart
import 'package:delta_e/delta_e.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the `delta_e` package to calculate color differences. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
void main() {
  // Define two colors
  Color color1 = Color(0xFF0000FF); // Blue
  Color color2 = Color(0xFFFF0000); // Red

  // Calculate the Delta E value
  double deltaE = DeltaE.deltaE(color1, color2);

  print('The Delta E value between the two colors is: $deltaE');
}
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to calculate the color difference between blue and red using the Delta E formula.

# Complete Example of Delta_E in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:delta_e/delta_e.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Delta E Example',
      home: ColorComparisonScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ColorComparisonScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Define two colors for comparison
    Color color1 = Color(0xFF0000FF); // Blue
    Color color2 = Color(0xFFFF0000); // Red

    // Calculate the Delta E value between the two colors
    double deltaE = DeltaE.deltaE(color1, color2);

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Delta E Color Comparison'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the colors
            Container(
              width: 100,
              height: 100,
              color: color1,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Container(
              width: 100,
              height: 100,
              color: color2,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Display the Delta E value
            Text(
              'Delta E: ${deltaE.toStringAsFixed(2)}',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The ColorComparisonScreen widget is displayed as the home screen.
// 4. Inside ColorComparisonScreen, two colors (blue and red) are defined.
// 5. The Delta E value between the two colors is calculated using the DeltaE class.
// 6. The UI consists of two colored containers representing the colors and a text widget displaying the calculated Delta E value.
// 7. The app is centered on the screen, providing a clear visual comparison of the two colors and their difference.
