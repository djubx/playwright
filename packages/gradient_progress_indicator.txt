# Gradient Progress Indicator
The `gradient_progress_indicator` package is a Flutter library that provides a customizable progress indicator with a gradient effect. It can be used to display a progress bar with a smooth, animated gradient that can be customized to fit your app's design.

## When to use this package
This package is useful when you want to display a progress bar that is more visually appealing than the standard progress bar. It can be used in a variety of situations, such as:

* Displaying the progress of a file download or upload
* Showing the progress of a task that takes a long time to complete
* Providing a visual indication of a user's progress through a series of steps

## Features
The `gradient_progress_indicator` package has the following features:

* Customizable gradient colors
* Adjustable animation speed
* Support for both linear and circular progress indicators
* Optional text display to show the progress percentage

# Setup and Usage
To use the `gradient_progress_indicator` package, follow these steps:

1. Add the package to your pubspec.yaml file:
```yml
dependencies:
  gradient_progress_indicator: ^1.0.0
```
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.
3. Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:gradient_progress_indicator/gradient_progress_indicator.dart';
```
4. Create a `GradientProgressIndicator` widget and customize its properties as needed:
```dart
GradientProgressIndicator(
  gradientColors: [Colors.blue, Colors.green],
  animationSpeed: 2.0,
  progress: 0.5,
  text: '50%',
)
```
### Platform-Specific Details
The `gradient_progress_indicator` package works on both Android and iOS platforms. However, there are some platform-specific considerations to keep in mind:

* On Android, the gradient effect may not work properly if the device's hardware acceleration is disabled.
* On iOS, the gradient effect may not work properly if the device's graphics processing unit (GPU) is not supported.

### Configurations and Optimizations
To optimize the performance of the `gradient_progress_indicator` package, you can try the following:

* Use a smaller animation speed to reduce the computational overhead of the gradient effect.
* Use a simpler gradient effect, such as a linear gradient, to reduce the computational overhead.
* Avoid using the `text` property if you don't need to display the progress percentage.

              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Create a button to increment the progress value
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  setState(() {
                    _progress += 0.1;
                    if (_progress > 1.0) _progress = 0.0;
                  });
                },
                child: Text('Increment Progress'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and sees the gradient progress indicator with a progress value of 0.0.
// 2. The user clicks the "Increment Progress" button to increment the progress value by 0.1.
// 3. The gradient progress indicator updates its display to show the new progress value.
// 4. The user can continue clicking the "Increment Progress" button to increment the progress value until it reaches 1.0.
// 5. When the progress value reaches 1.0, it wraps around to 0.0 and the gradient progress indicator resets its display.

// The gradient progress indicator is a customizable widget that can be used to display a progress bar with a smooth, animated gradient effect.
// It can be used in a variety of situations, such as displaying the progress of a file download or upload, showing the progress of a task that takes a long time to complete, or providing a visual indication of a user's progress through a series of steps.
