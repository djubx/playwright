# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Event Booking Timeline Package

## Installation
To use the `event_booking_timeline` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  event_booking_timeline: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, make sure to enable the necessary permissions in your `Info.plist` if your app requires any specific capabilities.

## Basic Usage
To use the `event_booking_timeline` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:event_booking_timeline/event_booking_timeline.dart';
```

You can then create a simple timeline widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:event_booking_timeline/event_booking_timeline.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Event Booking Timeline')),
        body: EventBookingTimeline(
          events: [
            EventData(date: DateTime.now(), title: 'Event 1'),
            EventData(date: DateTime.now().add(Duration(days: 1)), title: 'Event 2'),
            EventData(date: DateTime.now().add(Duration(days: 2)), title: 'Event 3'),
          ],
          onEventSelected: (event) {
            // Handle event selection
            print('Selected event: ${event.title}');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic event booking timeline with three events. When an event is selected, it prints the event title to the console.

# Complete Example of Event Booking Timeline

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:event_booking_timeline/event_booking_timeline.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Event Booking Timeline')),
        body: EventBookingTimeline(
          // List of events to display on the timeline
          events: [
            EventData(date: DateTime.now(), title: 'Event 1'),
            EventData(date: DateTime.now().add(Duration(days: 1)), title: 'Event 2'),
            EventData(date: DateTime.now().add(Duration(days: 2)), title: 'Event 3'),
          ],
          // Callback function when an event is selected
          onEventSelected: (event) {
            // Display a snackbar with the selected event title
            ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
              SnackBar(content: Text('Selected event: ${event.title}')),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the `RealFlutter` class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The `MaterialApp` widget is created, providing the basic structure of the app.
// 3. A `Scaffold` widget is used to create the app's layout, including an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The `EventBookingTimeline` widget is instantiated with a list of `EventData` objects.
// 5. Each `EventData` object represents an event with a date and title.
// 6. The `onEventSelected` callback is defined to handle user interactions with the timeline.
// 7. When an event is selected, a Snackbar is displayed with the title of the selected event.
// 8. The app is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, making it user-friendly.
