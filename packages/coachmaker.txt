# Setting Up and Using the Coachmaker Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up the `coachmaker` package in a Flutter project and demonstrate how to use it effectively.

## Step 1: Add the Dependency

First, add the `coachmaker` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  coachmaker: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Basic Setup

Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:coachmaker/coachmaker.dart';
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

Ensure your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

No specific configuration is required for iOS, but ensure your deployment target is set to iOS 9.0 or higher in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
```

## Step 4: Implementing Coach Marks

To implement coach marks, you need to define the steps and attach them to the widgets you want to highlight. Here's a basic setup:

```dart
final List<CoachStep> steps = [
  CoachStep(
    target: GlobalKey(),
    title: 'Welcome',
    description: 'This is the home screen of the app.',
  ),
  // Add more steps as needed
];
```

## Step 5: Displaying the Coach Marks

Use the `CoachMaker` widget to display the steps:

```dart
CoachMaker(
  steps: steps,
  onFinish: () {
    print('Tutorial finished');
  },
  child: RealFlutter(), // Your main widget
);
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:coachmaker/coachmaker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Coachmaker Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  final GlobalKey _homeKey = GlobalKey();
  final GlobalKey _settingsKey = GlobalKey();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Define the steps for the coach marks
    final List<CoachStep> steps = [
      CoachStep(
        target: _homeKey,
        title: 'Home Button',
        description: 'Tap here to go to the home screen.',
      ),
      CoachStep(
        target: _settingsKey,
        title: 'Settings Button',
        description: 'Tap here to open settings.',
      ),
    ];

    return CoachMaker(
      steps: steps,
      onFinish: () {
        // Callback when the tutorial is finished
        print('Tutorial finished');
      },
      child: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Coachmaker Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              ElevatedButton(
                key: _homeKey, // Key for the home button
                onPressed: () {
                  // Action for home button
                  print('Home button pressed');
                },
                child: Text('Home'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                key: _settingsKey, // Key for the settings button
                onPressed: () {
                  // Action for settings button
                  print('Settings button pressed');
                },
                child: Text('Settings'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the `MyApp` widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` widget is the main screen, containing two buttons: Home and Settings.
// 3. Each button is assigned a GlobalKey, which is used by the Coachmaker to identify the target widgets.
// 4. The `CoachMaker` widget wraps the `Scaffold` and takes a list of `CoachStep` objects.
// 5. Each `CoachStep` defines a target widget, a title, and a description.
// 6. When the app runs, the coach marks guide the user through the Home and Settings buttons.
// 7. The `onFinish` callback is triggered once the tutorial is completed, printing a message to the console.
