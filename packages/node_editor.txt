# Exploring the `node_editor` Flutter Package

The `node_editor` package is a powerful tool for creating node-based user interfaces in Flutter applications. It allows developers to build complex visual representations of data flows, making it ideal for applications that require visual programming, such as game engines, data processing tools, or any application that benefits from a node-based architecture.

## When to Use `node_editor`
- **Visual Programming**: If your application requires users to create and manipulate data flows visually.
- **Game Development**: For designing game logic or level editors where nodes represent different game elements.
- **Data Processing**: When building applications that require users to define workflows or data transformations visually.

## Key Features
- **Custom Node Types**: Create and manage custom nodes with specific properties and behaviors.
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Users can easily connect nodes and rearrange them using a drag-and-drop interface.
- **Zoom and Pan**: Supports zooming and panning for better navigation of complex node graphs.
- **Serialization**: Save and load node configurations, allowing users to persist their work.

The `node_editor` package is a versatile solution for developers looking to implement node-based interfaces in their Flutter applications.

# Setting Up and Using the `node_editor` Package

## Installation
To get started with the `node_editor` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  node_editor: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/node_editor).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions or configurations in your `Info.plist` file, depending on your app's requirements. However, the `node_editor` package does not require any specific configurations beyond standard Flutter setup.

## Basic Usage
To use the `node_editor` package, you will typically create a `NodeEditor` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set it up:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:node_editor/node_editor.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Node Editor Example')),
        body: NodeEditor(
          nodes: [], // Initialize with an empty list of nodes
          onNodeChanged: (nodes) {
            // Handle node changes
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with a `NodeEditor` widget. The `nodes` parameter is where you would pass your initial nodes, and `onNodeChanged` is a callback that gets triggered whenever the nodes are modified.

# Complete Example of Using `node_editor`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:node_editor/node_editor.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // List to hold the nodes
  List<Node> nodes = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize with a sample node
    nodes.add(Node(id: '1', title: 'Sample Node'));
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Node Editor Example')),
        body: NodeEditor(
          nodes: nodes, // Pass the list of nodes to the editor
          onNodeChanged: (updatedNodes) {
            // Update the state with the modified nodes
            setState(() {
              nodes = updatedNodes;
            });
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

// The above code defines a simple Flutter application using the `node_editor` package.
// 1. We start by importing the necessary packages.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` class is a StatefulWidget that maintains a list of nodes.
// 3. In the `initState` method, we initialize the nodes list with a sample node.
// 4. The `build` method constructs the UI, including a `NodeEditor` widget.
// 5. The `NodeEditor` takes the list of nodes and a callback to handle changes.
// 6. When nodes are modified, the `onNodeChanged` callback updates the state, allowing the UI to reflect the changes.

```
In this example, we have created a basic node editor application. The `NodeEditor` widget is initialized with a list of nodes, and any changes made to the nodes are reflected in the UI through the `setState` method.

## Summary
The `node_editor` package provides a robust framework for building node-based interfaces in Flutter applications. By following the setup and usage instructions, developers can create interactive and visually appealing applications that leverage the power of node-based programming. This example demonstrates the fundamental aspects of using the package, and you can expand upon it by adding more complex nodes and functionalities as needed.
