# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Timezone Button Dropdown Package

## Installation
To get started with the `timezone_button_dropdown` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  timezone_button_dropdown: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/timezone_button_dropdown).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable the necessary permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you are accessing location services to detect the user's time zone automatically. Add the following key:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to determine your time zone.</string>
```

## Using the Package
Once the package is installed and configured, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the timezone dropdown button.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:timezone_button_dropdown/timezone_button_dropdown.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Timezone Dropdown Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: TimezoneButtonDropdown(
            onChanged: (String? newValue) {
              // Handle the selected time zone
              print('Selected Time Zone: $newValue');
            },
            hint: Text('Select Time Zone'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with a dropdown button that allows users to select their time zone. The selected time zone is printed to the console when changed.

# Complete Example of Timezone Button Dropdown

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:timezone_button_dropdown/timezone_button_dropdown.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Timezone Dropdown Example'), // Title of the app
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: TimezoneButtonDropdown(
            onChanged: (String? newValue) {
              // This function is called when the user selects a time zone
              print('Selected Time Zone: $newValue'); // Print the selected time zone
            },
            hint: Text('Select Time Zone'), // Hint text for the dropdown
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the app
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Timezone Dropdown Example".
// 4. In the body of the Scaffold, a Center widget is used to center the TimezoneButtonDropdown.
// 5. The TimezoneButtonDropdown widget displays a dropdown for selecting time zones.
// 6. When a user selects a time zone, the onChanged callback is triggered, printing the selected time zone to the console.
// 7. The hint text "Select Time Zone" is displayed when no time zone is selected.
