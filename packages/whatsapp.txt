# Tutorial: Setting Up the WhatsApp Flutter Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the WhatsApp Flutter package and demonstrate how to use its features effectively.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the WhatsApp package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  whatsapp_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
    <string>whatsapp</string>
</array>
```

2. Ensure you have the necessary permissions for network access.

## Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:whatsapp_flutter/whatsapp_flutter.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the package to send messages or share media. Hereâ€™s a simple example of sending a message:

```dart
void sendMessage(String phoneNumber, String message) {
  WhatsAppFlutter.sendMessage(phoneNumber, message);
}
```

This function takes a phone number and a message as parameters and sends the message via WhatsApp.

## Conclusion

You have now set up the WhatsApp Flutter package in your application. You can explore its features further by checking the official documentation and experimenting with different functionalities.

# Complete Example: WhatsApp Integration in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:whatsapp_flutter/whatsapp_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'WhatsApp Integration',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('WhatsApp Integration Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Define the phone number and message
            String phoneNumber = '1234567890'; // Replace with a valid number
            String message = 'Hello from my Flutter app!';

            // Send the message using the WhatsApp package
            WhatsAppFlutter.sendMessage(phoneNumber, message);
          },
          child: Text('Send WhatsApp Message'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, there is an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, it defines a phone number and a message.
// 6. The WhatsAppFlutter.sendMessage function is called with the phone number and message, sending the message via WhatsApp.
```

// The application flow is straightforward:
// - The app initializes and displays a button on the home screen.
// - When the user taps the button, it triggers the sending of a WhatsApp message to the specified phone number.
// - This demonstrates the core functionality of the WhatsApp Flutter package, allowing for easy integration of messaging features into your Flutter applications.
