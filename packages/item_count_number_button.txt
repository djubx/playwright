// This is the main entry point of the application.
// The RealFlutterApp widget is the root of the application.
// It uses the MaterialApp widget to provide a Material Design theme to the application.
// The home property is set to the RealFlutterHomePage widget, which is the main page of the application.

// The RealFlutterHomePage widget is a stateful widget that displays the ItemCountNumberButton widget.
// The ItemCountNumberButton widget is customized with a minimum value of 1, a maximum value of 10, and an initial value of 5.
// The step property is set to 1, which means the value will increment or decrement by 1 when the buttons are pressed.
// The onChanged property is used to update the _selectedValue variable when the value changes.

// The Text widget is used to display the selected value.
// The setState function is used to update the UI when the value changes.

// In summary, this code creates a Material Design application with a single page that displays an ItemCountNumberButton widget.
// The widget allows the user to increment or decrement a value, and the selected value is displayed on the page.
