# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using item_count_number_button

## Installation
To use the `item_count_number_button` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  item_count_number_button: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/item_count_number_button).

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your app requires any specific capabilities. However, the `item_count_number_button` package does not require any special permissions.

## Basic Usage
To use the `item_count_number_button`, you can simply import the package and use the `ItemCountNumberButton` widget in your widget tree.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:item_count_number_button/item_count_number_button.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Item Count Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ItemCountNumberButton(
            initialValue: 1,
            minValue: 0,
            maxValue: 10,
            onChanged: (value) {
              // Handle the value change
              print('Current value: $value');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `ItemCountNumberButton` widget is initialized with a starting value of 1, a minimum value of 0, and a maximum value of 10. The `onChanged` callback is triggered whenever the value changes, allowing you to handle the new value accordingly.

# Complete Example of item_count_number_button

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:item_count_number_button/item_count_number_button.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Item Count Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ItemCountNumberButton(
            initialValue: 1, // Set the initial value to 1
            minValue: 0,     // Minimum value allowed is 0
            maxValue: 10,    // Maximum value allowed is 10
            onChanged: (value) {
              // This callback is triggered when the value changes
              print('Current value: $value'); // Print the current value to the console
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, the ItemCountNumberButton is placed.
// 5. The button is initialized with an initial value of 1, a minimum of 0, and a maximum of 10.
// 6. When the user interacts with the button, the onChanged callback is triggered, printing the current value to the console.
// 7. This allows for easy tracking of the selected quantity in the application.
