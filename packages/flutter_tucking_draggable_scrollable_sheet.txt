<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# flutter_tucking_draggable_scrollable_sheet

The `flutter_tucking_draggable_scrollable_sheet` package is a powerful Flutter widget that allows developers to create a draggable and scrollable sheet that can tuck away when not in use. This package is particularly useful for applications that require a bottom sheet that can be expanded or collapsed based on user interaction, providing a smooth and intuitive user experience.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using this package in scenarios such as:
- **Chat Applications**: To display a chat interface that can be expanded to show more messages or collapsed to save space.
- **Forms**: For forms that require a lot of input fields, allowing users to focus on one section at a time.
- **Media Players**: To show playback controls that can be tucked away when not needed.

## Features
- **Draggable**: Users can drag the sheet up and down to reveal or hide content.
- **Scrollable**: The content within the sheet can be scrolled independently of the main screen.
- **Customizable**: You can customize the appearance and behavior of the sheet to fit your app's design.

This package enhances user interaction by providing a dynamic way to manage content visibility, making it a valuable addition to any Flutter developer's toolkit.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_tucking_draggable_scrollable_sheet

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_tucking_draggable_scrollable_sheet` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_tucking_draggable_scrollable_sheet: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_tucking_draggable_scrollable_sheet).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that you have added the dependency and configured your project, you can start using the `TuckingDraggableScrollableSheet` widget in your application.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_tucking_draggable_scrollable_sheet/flutter_tucking_draggable_scrollable_sheet.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Tucking Draggable Scrollable Sheet')),
      body: Stack(
        children: [
          Center(child: Text('Main Content Area')),
          TuckingDraggableScrollableSheet(
            builder: (context, controller) {
              return Container(
                color: Colors.white,
                child: ListView.builder(
                  controller: controller,
                  itemCount: 30,
                  itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                    return ListTile(title: Text('Item #$index'));
                  },
                ),
              );
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple app with a main content area and a draggable scrollable sheet that displays a list of items. The `TuckingDraggableScrollableSheet` widget takes a builder function that provides a scroll controller, which you can use to control the scrolling of the content inside the sheet.

## Step 4: Customization

You can customize the appearance and behavior of the sheet by modifying its properties. For example, you can set the initial size, the maximum size, and the minimum size of the sheet.

```dart
TuckingDraggableScrollableSheet(
  initialChildSize: 0.5,
  minChildSize: 0.1,
  maxChildSize: 0.9,
  builder: (context, controller) {
    // Your content here
  },
)
```

This allows you to create a more tailored experience for your users, depending on the context of your application.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the `flutter_tucking_draggable_scrollable_sheet` package into your Flutter application effectively.

# Complete Example of flutter_tucking_draggable_scrollable_sheet

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_tucking_draggable_scrollable_sheet/flutter_tucking_draggable_scrollable_sheet.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Tucking Draggable Scrollable Sheet')),
      body: Stack(
        children: [
          // Main content area of the app
          Center(child: Text('Main Content Area')),
          
          // TuckingDraggableScrollableSheet widget
          TuckingDraggableScrollableSheet(
            initialChildSize: 0.5, // Initial size of the sheet
            minChildSize: 0.1, // Minimum size of the sheet
            maxChildSize: 0.9, // Maximum size of the sheet
            builder: (context, controller) {
              return Container(
                color: Colors.white, // Background color of the sheet
                child: ListView.builder(
                  controller: controller, // Controller for scrolling
                  itemCount: 30, // Number of items in the list
                  itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                    return ListTile(title: Text('Item #$index')); // List item
                  },
                ),
              );
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(home: RealFlutter()));
}
```

// The application starts with the main function, which runs the MaterialApp.
// The RealFlutter widget is the main screen of the app, containing an AppBar and a Stack.
// The Stack allows us to overlay the TuckingDraggableScrollableSheet on top of the main content area.
// The TuckingDraggableScrollableSheet is initialized with specific sizes for its child.
// Inside the sheet, we use a ListView.builder to create a scrollable list of items.
// The controller provided by the TuckingDraggableScrollableSheet allows the ListView to scroll independently.
// The app displays a simple message in the center and a list of items in the draggable sheet below it.
// Users can drag the sheet up and down to view more items or tuck it away when not needed.
