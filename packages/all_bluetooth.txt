# All Bluetooth Flutter Package

The **all_bluetooth** Flutter package is a powerful tool for developers looking to integrate Bluetooth functionality into their Flutter applications. This package provides a unified API for managing Bluetooth devices, enabling seamless communication between your app and various Bluetooth peripherals.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the **all_bluetooth** package in scenarios such as:
- Developing applications that require communication with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices, like fitness trackers or smart home devices.
- Creating apps that need to discover and connect to classic Bluetooth devices, such as headphones or speakers.
- Building IoT applications that interact with various Bluetooth-enabled sensors and actuators.

## Key Features

- **Device Discovery**: Easily discover nearby Bluetooth devices.
- **Connection Management**: Connect and disconnect from Bluetooth devices with minimal effort.
- **Data Transfer**: Send and receive data to and from connected devices.
- **Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS, providing a consistent API across platforms.
- **Event Handling**: Listen for connection state changes and data reception events.

With these features, the **all_bluetooth** package simplifies the process of integrating Bluetooth capabilities into your Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the All Bluetooth Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **all_bluetooth** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  all_bluetooth: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/all_bluetooth).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
```

3. If your app targets Android 12 (API level 31) or higher, you also need to add:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_SCAN"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request permission for Bluetooth usage:

```xml
<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires Bluetooth access to connect to devices.</string>
<key>NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires Bluetooth access to communicate with peripherals.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to discover and connect to Bluetooth devices.

# Complete Example: Bluetooth Device Discovery and Connection

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:all_bluetooth/all_bluetooth.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  List<BluetoothDevice> devices = []; // List to hold discovered devices
  BluetoothDevice? connectedDevice; // Currently connected device

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _discoverDevices(); // Start discovering devices on initialization
  }

  // Method to discover Bluetooth devices
  void _discoverDevices() async {
    // Start scanning for devices
    devices = await Bluetooth.scanForDevices();
    setState(() {}); // Update the UI with discovered devices
  }

  // Method to connect to a selected device
  void _connectToDevice(BluetoothDevice device) async {
    connectedDevice = await Bluetooth.connect(device); // Connect to the device
    setState(() {}); // Update the UI to reflect the connection
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Bluetooth Discovery')),
        body: Column(
          children: [
            Expanded(
              child: ListView.builder(
                itemCount: devices.length,
                itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                  return ListTile(
                    title: Text(devices[index].name), // Display device name
                    onTap: () => _connectToDevice(devices[index]), // Connect on tap
                  );
                },
              ),
            ),
            if (connectedDevice != null) // Show connected device info
              Padding(
                padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
                child: Text('Connected to: ${connectedDevice!.name}'),
              ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget, we initialize a list to hold discovered Bluetooth devices and a variable for the connected device.
// 3. The _discoverDevices method is called in initState to start scanning for Bluetooth devices.
// 4. The discovered devices are displayed in a ListView. When a device is tapped, the _connectToDevice method is called to connect to the selected device.
// 5. If a device is successfully connected, its name is displayed at the bottom of the screen.
```
