# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_native_select

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_native_select` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_native_select: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_native_select).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_native_select/flutter_native_select.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the `NativeSelect` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
NativeSelect(
  items: ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3'],
  onChanged: (value) {
    // Handle the selected value
  },
)
```

This will create a native dropdown with three options. You can handle the selection using the `onChanged` callback.

## Step 5: Customization

You can customize the dropdown by providing additional parameters such as `hint`, `icon`, and `style` to match your app's design.

```dart
NativeSelect(
  items: ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3'],
  hint: 'Select an option',
  icon: Icons.arrow_drop_down,
  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.blue),
  onChanged: (value) {
    // Handle the selected value
  },
)
```

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the `flutter_native_select` package in your Flutter application effectively.

# Complete Example of flutter_native_select

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_native_select/flutter_native_select.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Native Select Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Native Select Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: NativeSelectExample(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class NativeSelectExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _NativeSelectExampleState createState() => _NativeSelectExampleState();
}

class _NativeSelectExampleState extends State<NativeSelectExample> {
  String? selectedValue; // Variable to hold the selected value

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        // Display the selected value
        Text(
          selectedValue != null ? 'Selected: $selectedValue' : 'No selection made',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20), // Add some space
        // Native dropdown for selecting options
        NativeSelect(
          items: ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3'],
          hint: 'Select an option',
          icon: Icons.arrow_drop_down,
          style: TextStyle(color: Colors.blue),
          onChanged: (value) {
            setState(() {
              selectedValue = value; // Update the selected value
            });
          },
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds the NativeSelectExample widget.
// 4. NativeSelectExample is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the selected value.
// 5. In the build method, it displays the currently selected value or a message indicating no selection.
// 6. The NativeSelect widget is created with three options and a callback to handle changes.
// 7. When an option is selected, the onChanged callback updates the selectedValue state, triggering a rebuild to display the new selection.
