# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Dashed Path

## Installation

To get started with the dashed_path package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  dashed_path: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package

Once the package is installed, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a dashed line:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dashed_path/dashed_path.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Dashed Path Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: DashedPath(
          dashPattern: [10, 5], // Length of dash and space
          color: Colors.blue,
          strokeWidth: 2.0,
          path: Path()
            ..moveTo(50, 100)
            ..lineTo(250, 100), // Create a horizontal dashed line
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code creates a simple dashed line across the screen. You can customize the `dashPattern`, `color`, and `strokeWidth` to fit your design needs.

# Complete Example of Dashed Path

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dashed_path/dashed_path.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dashed Path Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Dashed Path Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Create a dashed line
            DashedPath(
              dashPattern: [10, 5], // Length of dash and space
              color: Colors.blue,
              strokeWidth: 2.0,
              path: Path()
                ..moveTo(50, 100) // Start point of the dashed line
                ..lineTo(250, 100), // End point of the dashed line
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Add space between elements
            Text('Dashed Line Above'), // Text below the dashed line
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to stack the dashed line and text vertically.
// 5. DashedPath is used to create a dashed line with a specified dash pattern, color, and stroke width.
// 6. The dashed line is drawn from point (50, 100) to (250, 100).
// 7. A SizedBox is added for spacing, followed by a Text widget that displays a label below the dashed line.
