```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following keys to request permission for sharing:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to share images.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to save images to your photo library.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
Hereâ€™s how to use the package in your Flutter application:

1. Import the package:

```dart
import 'package:share_files_and_screenshot_widgets_plus/share_files_and_screenshot_widgets_plus.dart';
```

2. Use the package to share a file or take a screenshot:

```dart
void shareFile(String filePath) async {
  await ShareFilesAndScreenshotWidgetsPlus.shareFile(filePath);
}

void captureAndShareWidget(GlobalKey key) async {
  RenderRepaintBoundary boundary = key.currentContext.findRenderObject();
  var image = await boundary.toImage(pixelRatio: 3.0);
  // Convert the image to a file and share it
}
```

This setup allows you to share files and capture screenshots of specific widgets in your Flutter app.

# Complete Example of Using share_files_and_screenshot_widgets_plus

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:share_files_and_screenshot_widgets_plus/share_files_and_screenshot_widgets_plus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Share Files and Screenshot Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  // Create a GlobalKey to capture the widget
  final GlobalKey _globalKey = GlobalKey();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Share and Screenshot Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: RepaintBoundary(
          key: _globalKey, // This key is used to capture the widget
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text('Hello, Flutter!'),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () async {
                  // Capture and share the widget
                  await captureAndShareWidget();
                },
                child: Text('Share Screenshot'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  Future<void> captureAndShareWidget() async {
    // Capture the widget as an image
    RenderRepaintBoundary boundary = _globalKey.currentContext.findRenderObject();
    var image = await boundary.toImage(pixelRatio: 3.0);
    // Convert the image to a byte data
    ByteData byteData = await image.toByteData(format: ImageByteFormat.png);
    // Convert byte data to a list of bytes
    final Uint8List pngBytes = byteData.buffer.asUint8List();
    
    // Share the image
    await ShareFilesAndScreenshotWidgetsPlus.shareImageWithText(
      pngBytes,
      text: 'Check out this screenshot!',
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The app starts and displays the HomeScreen.
// 2. The HomeScreen contains a RepaintBoundary widget that allows us to capture its child widget.
// 3. When the user presses the "Share Screenshot" button, the captureAndShareWidget method is called.
// 4. This method captures the widget as an image and converts it to a byte array.
// 5. Finally, it uses the share_files_and_screenshot_widgets_plus package to share the image with a text message.
