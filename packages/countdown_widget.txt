# Tutorial

## Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

Add the countdown_widget package to your project by adding the following line to your pubspec.yaml file:
```yml
dependencies:
  countdown_widget: ^1.0.0
```
Then, run `flutter pub get` to get the package.

## Step 2: Import the Package

Import the countdown_widget package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:countdown_widget/countdown_widget.dart';
```
## Step 3: Create a Countdown Timer

Create a countdown timer by calling the `CountdownWidget` constructor:
```dart
CountdownWidget(
  duration: Duration(days: 1, hours: 2, minutes: 3, seconds: 4),
  onFinish: () {
    print('Countdown finished!');
  },
)
```
## Platform-Specific Details

* On Android, the countdown timer will continue to run even when the app is in the background.
* On iOS, the countdown timer will pause when the app is in the background and resume when the app is brought back to the foreground.

## Configurations and Optimizations

* You can customize the countdown timer format by passing a `format` parameter to the `CountdownWidget` constructor.
* You can pause and resume the countdown timer by calling the `pause` and `resume` methods on the `CountdownWidget` instance.
