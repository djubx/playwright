# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Calendar Time Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `calendar_time` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  calendar_time: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the package to start using it:

```dart
import 'package:calendar_time/calendar_time.dart';
```

## Step 4: Basic Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the `calendar_time` package to manipulate dates:

```dart
void main() {
  // Create a new date
  var today = CalendarTime.now();
  
  // Add 5 days to today's date
  var futureDate = today.addDays(5);
  
  // Format the date
  print("Today's date: ${today.format('yyyy-MM-dd')}");
  print("Future date: ${futureDate.format('yyyy-MM-dd')}");
}
```

This example demonstrates how to create a date, add days to it, and format it for display.

# Complete Example of Using the Calendar Time Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:calendar_time/calendar_time.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Calendar Time Example',
      home: CalendarHome(),
    );
  }
}

class CalendarHome extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Get the current date
    var today = CalendarTime.now();
    
    // Add 7 days to today's date
    var futureDate = today.addDays(7);
    
    // Format the dates for display
    String todayFormatted = today.format('MMMM d, yyyy');
    String futureDateFormatted = futureDate.format('MMMM d, yyyy');

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Calendar Time Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Today\'s Date: $todayFormatted'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text('Future Date (7 days later): $futureDateFormatted'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget (CalendarHome).
// 3. CalendarHome is a StatelessWidget that builds the UI.
// 4. Inside CalendarHome, we get the current date using CalendarTime.now().
// 5. We then add 7 days to the current date using the addDays() method.
// 6. Both today's date and the future date are formatted for display.
// 7. The Scaffold widget provides the app structure, including an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 8. The Center widget contains a Column that displays today's date and the future date.
// 9. The app runs and displays the formatted dates on the screen.
```
