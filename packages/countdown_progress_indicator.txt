# Complete Example of Countdown Progress Indicator

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:countdown_progress_indicator/countdown_progress_indicator.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Countdown Progress Indicator Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Countdown Progress Indicator'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: CountdownProgressIndicator(
            duration: 10, // Countdown duration in seconds
            initialDuration: 10, // Initial duration for the countdown
            onComplete: () {
              // Callback when the countdown completes
              print("Countdown completed!");
            },
            strokeWidth: 8.0, // Width of the progress indicator
            backgroundColor: Colors.grey, // Background color of the indicator
            progressColor: Colors.blue, // Color of the progress indicator
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Countdown Progress Indicator".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains the CountdownProgressIndicator widget.
// 5. The CountdownProgressIndicator is set to count down from 10 seconds, with a callback that prints a message when the countdown completes.
