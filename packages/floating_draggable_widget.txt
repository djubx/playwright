# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Floating Draggable Widget

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **floating_draggable_widget** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  floating_draggable_widget: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/floating_draggable_widget).

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configurations

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable the use of Swift in your project. Open your `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode and ensure that the project settings are configured to support Swift.

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:floating_draggable_widget/floating_draggable_widget.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Floating Draggable Widget

You can now use the `FloatingDraggableWidget` in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
FloatingDraggableWidget(
  child: YourWidget(), // Replace with your widget
  initialPosition: Offset(100, 100), // Starting position
  onDragEnd: (offset) {
    // Handle the end of the drag
  },
);
```

This will create a draggable widget that starts at the specified position. You can customize the behavior further by using additional properties provided by the package.

# Complete Example of Floating Draggable Widget

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:floating_draggable_widget/floating_draggable_widget.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Floating Draggable Widget Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Floating Draggable Widget'),
        ),
        body: Stack(
          children: [
            // Background Container
            Container(
              color: Colors.blueGrey[100],
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'Drag the Floating Widget!',
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
                ),
              ),
            ),
            // Floating Draggable Widget
            FloatingDraggableWidget(
              child: Container(
                width: 100,
                height: 100,
                color: Colors.red,
                child: Center(
                  child: Text(
                    'Drag Me!',
                    style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
                  ),
                ),
              ),
              initialPosition: Offset(150, 300), // Initial position of the widget
              onDragEnd: (offset) {
                // This callback is triggered when the drag ends
                print('Widget dragged to: $offset');
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, a Stack widget is used to layer the background and the draggable widget.
// 4. A Container with a light blue-grey color serves as the background, displaying a centered text message.
// 5. The FloatingDraggableWidget is created with a red container as its child, which contains the text "Drag Me!".
// 6. The initial position of the draggable widget is set to (150, 300) on the screen.
// 7. When the widget is dragged and released, the onDragEnd callback is triggered, printing the new position to the console.
```
