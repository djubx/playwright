# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Stories for Flutter

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the **stories_for_flutter** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  stories_for_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/stories_for_flutter).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:stories_for_flutter/stories_for_flutter.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package
You can now use the `RealFlutter` class to create a story view. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:stories_for_flutter/stories_for_flutter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Stories Example')),
        body: StoryView(
          storyItems: [
            StoryItem.text(title: 'Welcome to Stories!', backgroundColor: Colors.blue),
            StoryItem.pageImage(url: 'https://example.com/image1.jpg', caption: 'Image 1'),
            StoryItem.pageVideo(url: 'https://example.com/video1.mp4', caption: 'Video 1'),
          ],
          onStoryShow: (s) {
            print('Showing story: ${s.title}');
          },
          onComplete: () {
            print('All stories completed');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic story view with text, image, and video items. The `onStoryShow` and `onComplete` callbacks allow you to handle events when stories are shown or completed.

# Complete Example of Stories for Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:stories_for_flutter/stories_for_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Stories Example')),
        body: StoryView(
          // Define the list of story items
          storyItems: [
            // First story item: Text
            StoryItem.text(
              title: 'Welcome to Stories!',
              backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
            ),
            // Second story item: Image
            StoryItem.pageImage(
              url: 'https://example.com/image1.jpg',
              caption: 'Image 1',
            ),
            // Third story item: Video
            StoryItem.pageVideo(
              url: 'https://example.com/video1.mp4',
              caption: 'Video 1',
            ),
          ],
          // Callback when a story is shown
          onStoryShow: (s) {
            print('Showing story: ${s.title}');
          },
          // Callback when all stories are completed
          onComplete: () {
            print('All stories completed');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a StoryView.
// 3. The StoryView is populated with a list of story items, including text, image, and video.
// 4. The onStoryShow callback prints the title of the currently displayed story to the console.
// 5. The onComplete callback notifies when all stories have been viewed, printing a message to the console.
