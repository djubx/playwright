# Anadea Stepper: A Comprehensive Overview

The **anadea_stepper** Flutter package is a versatile and customizable stepper widget that allows developers to create multi-step forms and processes in their applications. This package is particularly useful for scenarios where user input is required in a sequential manner, such as onboarding processes, checkout flows, or any form that requires multiple steps to complete.

## When to Use This Package
- **Onboarding Flows**: Guide users through the initial setup of your app.
- **Checkout Processes**: Simplify the purchase process by breaking it into manageable steps.
- **Multi-step Forms**: Collect user information in a structured way without overwhelming them.

## Key Features
- **Customizable Steps**: Easily define the number of steps and their content.
- **Navigation Control**: Users can navigate between steps with next and previous buttons.
- **Validation Support**: Implement validation logic for each step to ensure data integrity.
- **Responsive Design**: The stepper adapts to different screen sizes, making it suitable for both mobile and web applications.

The **anadea_stepper** package enhances user experience by providing a clear and organized way to collect information, making it a valuable addition to any Flutter developer's toolkit.

# Anadea Stepper: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To use the **anadea_stepper** package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  anadea_stepper: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your stepper involves any features that require user permissions (like camera access).

## Basic Usage
To use the **anadea_stepper** package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:anadea_stepper/anadea_stepper.dart';
```

You can then create a simple stepper widget in your Flutter application. Below is a basic example of how to implement the stepper.

```dart
// Inside your widget build method
AnadeaStepper(
  steps: [
    Step(
      title: Text('Step 1'),
      content: Text('This is the content for step 1.'),
    ),
    Step(
      title: Text('Step 2'),
      content: Text('This is the content for step 2.'),
    ),
    Step(
      title: Text('Step 3'),
      content: Text('This is the content for step 3.'),
    ),
  ],
  onStepContinue: () {
    // Logic to move to the next step
  },
  onStepCancel: () {
    // Logic to move to the previous step
  },
)
```

This basic setup will create a stepper with three steps. You can customize the content and behavior as needed.

# Complete Example of Anadea Stepper

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:anadea_stepper/anadea_stepper.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  int _currentStep = 0; // Track the current step

  // List of steps for the stepper
  List<Step> _steps = [
    Step(
      title: Text('Step 1'),
      content: Column(
        children: [
          Text('Enter your name:'),
          TextField(), // Input field for name
        ],
      ),
    ),
    Step(
      title: Text('Step 2'),
      content: Column(
        children: [
          Text('Enter your email:'),
          TextField(), // Input field for email
        ],
      ),
    ),
    Step(
      title: Text('Step 3'),
      content: Column(
        children: [
          Text('Confirm your details:'),
          // Display confirmation details here
        ],
      ),
    ),
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Anadea Stepper Example')),
        body: AnadeaStepper(
          steps: _steps,
          currentStep: _currentStep,
          onStepContinue: () {
            // Move to the next step if not at the last step
            if (_currentStep < _steps.length - 1) {
              setState(() {
                _currentStep++;
              });
            } else {
              // Handle completion of the stepper
              print('Completed!');
            }
          },
          onStepCancel: () {
            // Move to the previous step if not at the first step
            if (_currentStep > 0) {
              setState(() {
                _currentStep--;
              });
            }
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```
// The above code creates a simple Flutter application using the Anadea Stepper package.
// 
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget maintains the current step index (_currentStep) and defines a list of steps (_steps) with titles and content.
// 3. The build method returns a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and the Anadea Stepper.
// 4. The Anadea Stepper is configured with the steps, current step, and handlers for continuing and canceling steps.
// 5. The onStepContinue method increments the current step index, and if the last step is reached, it prints 'Completed!'.
// 6. The onStepCancel method decrements the current step index, allowing users to navigate back through the steps.
// 
// This example demonstrates how to create a multi-step form using the Anadea Stepper package, providing a clear and organized way for users to input their information.
