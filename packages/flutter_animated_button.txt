# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_animated_button

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `flutter_animated_button` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_animated_button: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement an animated button.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_animated_button/flutter_animated_button.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Animated Button Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: AnimatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Action to perform on button press
              print('Button Pressed!');
            },
            child: Text('Click Me'),
            duration: 1.0, // Animation duration
            color: Colors.blue, // Button color
            // Additional properties can be set here
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with an animated button that prints a message to the console when pressed.

# Complete Example of flutter_animated_button

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_animated_button/flutter_animated_button.dart';

// Main class of the application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Animated Button Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: AnimatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Action to perform on button press
              print('Button Pressed!'); // Log message to console
            },
            child: Text('Click Me'), // Text displayed on the button
            duration: 1.0, // Duration of the animation
            color: Colors.blue, // Background color of the button
            // You can customize more properties like borderRadius, elevation, etc.
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
3. Inside the Center widget, an AnimatedButton is created.
4. The button has an onPressed callback that prints 'Button Pressed!' to the console when clicked.
5. The button displays the text 'Click Me' and has a blue background color.
6. The animation duration is set to 1.0 seconds, providing a smooth transition when the button is pressed.
7. This simple structure allows for easy customization and integration into larger applications.
