# Fleather Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with Fleather, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  fleather: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/fleather).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    compileSdkVersion 31 // or latest version
    ...
}

dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.3.1' // or latest version
    ...
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0' # or higher
```

After making these changes, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up Fleather, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a basic text editor using Fleather.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fleather/fleather.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Fleather Example',
      home: EditorScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class EditorScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _EditorScreenState createState() => _EditorScreenState();
}

class _EditorScreenState extends State<EditorScreen> {
  // Create a controller for the Fleather editor
  final FleatherController _controller = FleatherController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Fleather Text Editor'),
        actions: [
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.save),
            onPressed: () {
              // Save the content of the editor
              final content = _controller.document.toPlainText();
              print('Saved content: $content');
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Fleather editor widget
          Expanded(
            child: FleatherEditor(
              controller: _controller,
              focusNode: FocusNode(),
              // Customize the toolbar
              toolbar: FleatherToolbar(
                onBold: () {
                  _controller.toggleBold();
                },
                onItalic: () {
                  _controller.toggleItalic();
                },
                onUnderline: () {
                  _controller.toggleUnderline();
                },
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets the home to EditorScreen.
// 3. EditorScreen creates a stateful widget that manages the Fleather editor.
// 4. A FleatherController is instantiated to control the editor's content and formatting.
// 5. The AppBar contains a save button that prints the current content of the editor to the console.
// 6. The body of the screen contains the FleatherEditor widget, which displays the text editor.
// 7. The toolbar allows users to toggle bold, italic, and underline formatting options.
// 8. The editor updates in real-time as users type and apply formatting.
```
