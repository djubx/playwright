# Overview of the "batch" Flutter Package

The "batch" Flutter package is designed to facilitate batch processing of tasks in a Flutter application. This package is particularly useful when you need to perform multiple operations simultaneously, such as making several network requests or processing data in bulk. By using the "batch" package, developers can optimize performance and improve the user experience by reducing the time taken for multiple operations to complete.

## When to Use the "batch" Package
- **Network Requests**: When you need to fetch data from multiple APIs at once.
- **Data Processing**: For scenarios where you need to process large datasets in chunks.
- **File Operations**: When performing multiple file read/write operations concurrently.

## Key Features
- **Concurrency**: Execute multiple tasks in parallel, improving performance.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in mechanisms to handle errors for each task.
- **Customizable**: Allows developers to define the number of concurrent tasks.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that integrates seamlessly with existing Flutter applications.

# Setting Up and Using the "batch" Package

## Installation
To use the "batch" package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  batch: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your batch operations involve network requests or file access.

## Basic Usage
To use the "batch" package, you will typically create an instance of the `Batch` class and define the tasks you want to execute. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:batch/batch.dart';

void main() {
  final batch = Batch();

  // Define tasks
  batch.add(() async {
    // Simulate a network request
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));
    return 'Task 1 completed';
  });

  batch.add(() async {
    // Simulate another network request
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3));
    return 'Task 2 completed';
  });

  // Execute all tasks
  batch.execute().then((results) {
    print(results); // Output: ['Task 1 completed', 'Task 2 completed']
  });
}
```

In this example, we create a batch of two tasks that simulate network requests. The `execute` method runs all tasks concurrently and returns their results.

# Complete Example of Using the "batch" Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:batch/batch.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Batch Example',
      home: BatchExample(),
    );
  }
}

class BatchExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _BatchExampleState createState() => _BatchExampleState();
}

class _BatchExampleState extends State<BatchExample> {
  List<String> results = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _performBatchTasks(); // Call the method to perform batch tasks
  }

  // Method to perform batch tasks
  void _performBatchTasks() async {
    final batch = Batch();

    // Adding tasks to the batch
    batch.add(() async {
      await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2)); // Simulate network delay
      return 'Task 1 completed'; // Return result of task 1
    });

    batch.add(() async {
      await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3)); // Simulate network delay
      return 'Task 2 completed'; // Return result of task 2
    });

    // Execute all tasks and update the state with results
    final results = await batch.execute();
    setState(() {
      this.results = results; // Update the results state
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Batch Processing Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: results.isEmpty
            ? CircularProgressIndicator() // Show loading indicator while tasks are running
            : Column(
                mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
                children: results.map((result) => Text(result)).toList(), // Display results
              ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and home set to BatchExample.
// 3. In the BatchExample widget, the _performBatchTasks method is called in initState.
// 4. Inside _performBatchTasks, a Batch instance is created, and two tasks are added.
// 5. Each task simulates a network request with a delay and returns a completion message.
// 6. The execute method runs all tasks concurrently and waits for their results.
// 7. Once the results are obtained, the state is updated, and the UI reflects the results.
// 8. If results are empty, a loading indicator is shown; otherwise, the results are displayed.
