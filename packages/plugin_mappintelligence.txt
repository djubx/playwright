# Overview of the plugin_mappintelligence Flutter Package

The `plugin_mappintelligence` package is designed to integrate Map Intelligence functionalities into Flutter applications. This package allows developers to leverage advanced mapping capabilities, including geolocation, route optimization, and data visualization, making it an excellent choice for applications that require location-based services.

## When to Use This Package
- **Location-Based Services**: If your application needs to provide users with location tracking or mapping features.
- **Data Visualization**: When you want to visualize data on maps, such as heatmaps or markers.
- **Route Optimization**: For applications that require route planning and optimization based on user location.

## Key Features
- **Geolocation Support**: Access to the device's GPS for real-time location tracking.
- **Custom Map Overlays**: Ability to add custom markers and overlays to maps.
- **Route Planning**: Features for calculating and displaying optimal routes.
- **Data Integration**: Seamless integration with various data sources for enhanced mapping capabilities.

This package is particularly useful for developers looking to create applications in sectors like logistics, travel, and real estate, where mapping and location services are crucial.

# Setup and Usage of the plugin_mappintelligence Package

## Installation
To add the `plugin_mappintelligence` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  plugin_mappintelligence: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/plugin_mappintelligence).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the necessary permissions for location access:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/>
```

3. Ensure that your app's `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request location permissions:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to provide mapping services.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to provide mapping services.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `plugin_mappintelligence` package, you can start by initializing the Map Intelligence service in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:plugin_mappintelligence/plugin_mappintelligence.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize Map Intelligence
    PluginMapIntelligence.initialize();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Map Intelligence Example')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Map will be displayed here')),
    );
  }
}
```

This code initializes the Map Intelligence service and sets up a basic Flutter application structure.

# Complete Example of Using plugin_mappintelligence

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:plugin_mappintelligence/plugin_mappintelligence.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to hold the user's current location
  LocationData? _currentLocation;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize Map Intelligence
    PluginMapIntelligence.initialize();
    // Fetch the current location
    _getCurrentLocation();
  }

  // Method to get the current location
  void _getCurrentLocation() async {
    // Request location permission
    await PluginMapIntelligence.requestLocationPermission();
    // Get the current location
    _currentLocation = await PluginMapIntelligence.getCurrentLocation();
    // Update the UI with the current location
    setState(() {});
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Map Intelligence Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: _currentLocation == null
            ? CircularProgressIndicator() // Show loading indicator while fetching location
            : Text('Current Location: ${_currentLocation!.latitude}, ${_currentLocation!.longitude}'), // Display current location
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```
// This Flutter application demonstrates the use of the plugin_mappintelligence package.
// 1. The app starts by running the MyApp class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 3. In the initState method, the Map Intelligence service is initialized.
// 4. The _getCurrentLocation method is called to fetch the user's current location.
// 5. The app requests location permissions and retrieves the current location using the PluginMapIntelligence methods.
// 6. The UI updates to display the current latitude and longitude once the location is fetched.
// 7. If the location is still being fetched, a CircularProgressIndicator is shown to indicate loading.
