# Flutter Inset Shadow Package
================================

The `flutter_inset_shadow` package is a Flutter library that allows you to create widgets with inset shadows. Inset shadows are a type of shadow that appears inside the boundaries of a widget, rather than outside. This package provides a simple and easy-to-use way to add inset shadows to your Flutter widgets.

## When to Use This Package
---------------------------

You can use this package whenever you want to add a shadow effect to a widget, but you want the shadow to appear inside the widget's boundaries rather than outside. This can be useful for creating a variety of visual effects, such as:

* Creating a sense of depth or dimensionality
* Highlighting a widget's content
* Adding a touch of elegance or sophistication to your app's design

## Features
------------

The `flutter_inset_shadow` package provides the following features:

* Support for creating inset shadows with a variety of colors, blur radii, and spread radii
* Support for creating inset shadows with different shapes, including rectangles, circles, and more
* Easy-to-use API that makes it simple to add inset shadows to your widgets

# Using the Flutter Inset Shadow Package
=====================================

## Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project
-----------------------------------------

To use the `flutter_inset_shadow` package, you'll need to add it to your project's `pubspec.yaml` file. You can do this by adding the following line to the `dependencies` section of the file:
```yml
dependencies:
  flutter_inset_shadow: ^1.0.0
```
## Step 2: Import the Package
---------------------------

Once you've added the package to your project, you'll need to import it into your Dart file. You can do this by adding the following line to the top of your file:
```dart
import 'package:flutter_inset_shadow/flutter_inset_shadow.dart';
```
## Step 3: Create a Widget with an Inset Shadow
---------------------------------------------

To create a widget with an inset shadow, you can use the `InsetShadow` widget provided by the package. Here's an example:
```dart
InsetShadow(
  child: Container(
    width: 100,
    height: 100,
    color: Colors.white,
  ),
  color: Colors.black,
  blurRadius: 10,
  spreadRadius: 5,
)
```
This will create a white container with a black inset shadow.

## Platform-Specific Details
---------------------------

The `flutter_inset_shadow` package works on both Android and iOS platforms. However, there are some platform-specific details to keep in mind:

* On Android, the inset shadow will be rendered using the `android.graphics.drawable.Drawable` class.
* On iOS, the inset shadow will be rendered using the `CALayer` class.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_inset_shadow/flutter_inset_shadow.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Inset Shadow Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Inset Shadow Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: InsetShadow(
          // Create a white container with a black inset shadow
          child: Container(
            width: 200,
            height: 200,
            color: Colors.white,
          ),
          color: Colors.black,
          blurRadius: 20,
          spreadRadius: 10,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The app starts by running the main function, which creates a new instance of the MyApp widget.
// The MyApp widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a theme.
// The home property of the MaterialApp is set to an instance of the MyHomePage widget.
// The MyHomePage widget builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// The body of the Scaffold is a Center widget that contains an InsetShadow widget.
// The InsetShadow widget creates a white container with a black inset shadow.
// The inset shadow is rendered using the android.graphics.drawable.Drawable class on Android and the CALayer class on iOS.
