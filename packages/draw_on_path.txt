# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Draw on Path Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **draw_on_path** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  draw_on_path: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/draw_on_path).

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:draw_on_path/draw_on_path.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package

You can now use the **draw_on_path** package in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement it.

# Complete Example of Using Draw on Path

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:draw_on_path/draw_on_path.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Draw on Path Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Draw on Path Example'),
        ),
        body: DrawOnPathDemo(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DrawOnPathDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DrawOnPathDemoState createState() => _DrawOnPathDemoState();
}

class _DrawOnPathDemoState extends State<DrawOnPathDemo> {
  // Create a path for drawing
  Path _path = Path();
  // Define a Paint object to customize the drawing
  Paint _paint = Paint()
    ..color = Colors.blue
    ..strokeWidth = 5.0
    ..style = PaintingStyle.stroke;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Define the path to draw
    _path.moveTo(50, 100); // Start point
    _path.lineTo(200, 100); // Draw line to the right
    _path.lineTo(200, 300); // Draw line down
    _path.lineTo(50, 300); // Draw line to the left
    _path.close(); // Close the path
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(
      child: CustomPaint(
        size: Size(300, 400), // Set the size of the canvas
        painter: DrawOnPathPainter(_path, _paint), // Use the custom painter
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Custom painter class to handle the drawing
class DrawOnPathPainter extends CustomPainter {
  final Path path;
  final Paint paint;

  DrawOnPathPainter(this.path, this.paint);

  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    // Draw the path on the canvas
    canvas.drawPath(path, paint);
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(covariant CustomPainter oldDelegate) {
    return false; // No need to repaint
  }
}
```

```
// Explanation of the application flow:

// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold containing an AppBar and the DrawOnPathDemo widget.
// 3. The DrawOnPathDemo widget is a StatefulWidget that manages the drawing path and paint properties.
// 4. In the initState method, a Path is defined with specific points to create a rectangle shape.
// 5. The build method returns a CustomPaint widget, which uses the DrawOnPathPainter to draw the defined path on the canvas.
// 6. The DrawOnPathPainter class extends CustomPainter and overrides the paint method to draw the path using the provided Paint object.
// 7. The shouldRepaint method returns false, indicating that the painter does not need to repaint unless the path or paint changes.
```
