# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Instagram Share Plus

## Installation
To get started with the `instagram_share_plus` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  instagram_share_plus: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/instagram_share_plus).

## Platform-Specific Setup

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following key to allow sharing:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to share images.</string>
```

## Using the Package
To use the package, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:instagram_share_plus/instagram_share_plus.dart';
```

You can then create a function to share an image:

```dart
void shareToInstagram(String imagePath) async {
  final result = await InstagramShare.shareToInstagram(imagePath);
  if (result) {
    print("Shared successfully!");
  } else {
    print("Failed to share.");
  }
}
```

This function takes the path of the image you want to share and uses the `shareToInstagram` method provided by the package.

With this setup, you are ready to share content to Instagram from your Flutter application!

# Complete Example: Instagram Share Plus in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:instagram_share_plus/instagram_share_plus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Instagram Share Plus Example',
      home: ShareScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ShareScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  // This function will be called when the user presses the share button
  void shareToInstagram(String imagePath) async {
    // Attempt to share the image to Instagram
    final result = await InstagramShare.shareToInstagram(imagePath);
    // Check the result of the sharing attempt
    if (result) {
      // If successful, show a success message
      print("Shared successfully!");
    } else {
      // If failed, show an error message
      print("Failed to share.");
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Share to Instagram'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Specify the path of the image to share
            String imagePath = 'path/to/your/image.jpg';
            // Call the share function
            shareToInstagram(imagePath);
          },
          child: Text('Share Image to Instagram'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (ShareScreen).
// 3. ShareScreen contains a button that, when pressed, triggers the shareToInstagram function.
// 4. The shareToInstagram function attempts to share the specified image path to Instagram.
// 5. Depending on the result of the sharing attempt, it prints a success or failure message to the console.
