# Flutter Camera ML Vision Package

The `flutter_camera_ml_vision` package is a powerful tool for integrating machine learning capabilities into Flutter applications using the device's camera. This package allows developers to leverage various machine learning models for tasks such as object detection, image classification, and barcode scanning directly from the camera feed.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `flutter_camera_ml_vision` package in scenarios where you need real-time image processing capabilities, such as:

- **Augmented Reality Applications**: Enhance user experiences by overlaying digital information on the real world.
- **Object Detection**: Identify and track objects in real-time, useful in applications like inventory management or security.
- **Barcode Scanning**: Quickly scan and process barcodes for e-commerce or inventory applications.
- **Image Classification**: Classify images based on predefined categories, useful in various domains like healthcare, retail, and more.

## Features

- **Real-time Camera Feed**: Access the camera feed in real-time for immediate processing.
- **Multiple ML Models**: Support for various machine learning models for different tasks.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API for quick setup and usage in Flutter applications.

With these features, the `flutter_camera_ml_vision` package provides a robust solution for developers looking to incorporate machine learning functionalities into their mobile applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_camera_ml_vision

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_camera_ml_vision` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_camera_ml_vision` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_camera_ml_vision: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_camera_ml_vision).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open `AndroidManifest.xml` located in `android/app/src/main/` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FLASHLIGHT"/>
   ```

2. **Minimum SDK Version**: Ensure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open `Info.plist` located in `ios/Runner/` and add the following keys:

   ```xml
   <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to the camera for scanning.</string>
   <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to the photo library for scanning.</string>
   ```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple application that uses the camera to detect objects.

1. **Import the Package**:

   In your Dart file, import the package:

   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
   import 'package:flutter_camera_ml_vision/flutter_camera_ml_vision.dart';
   ```

2. **Create the Main Application**:

   Create a new Flutter widget that initializes the camera and processes the images.

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Camera ML Vision',
      home: CameraScreen(),
    );
  }
}
```

3. **Implement the Camera Screen**:

   Create a `CameraScreen` widget that uses the camera feed.

```dart
class CameraScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CameraScreenState createState() => _CameraScreenState();
}

class _CameraScreenState extends State<CameraScreen> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Camera ML Vision')),
      body: CameraMlVision(
        onImage: (inputImage) {
          // Process the image here
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This basic setup will allow you to access the camera feed and process images in real-time.

# Complete Example of flutter_camera_ml_vision

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_camera_ml_vision/flutter_camera_ml_vision.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Camera ML Vision',
      home: CameraScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class CameraScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CameraScreenState createState() => _CameraScreenState();
}

class _CameraScreenState extends State<CameraScreen> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Camera ML Vision')),
      body: CameraMlVision(
        onImage: (inputImage) {
          // Process the image here
          // For example, you can call a ML model to analyze the image
          // and update the UI based on the results.
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The home of the app is set to CameraScreen, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 3. In the CameraScreen, we build a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body contains the CameraMlVision widget, which provides the camera feed.
// 5. The onImage callback is triggered whenever a new image is captured by the camera.
// 6. Inside the onImage callback, you can process the image using a machine learning model.
// 7. The app can be extended to display results or perform actions based on the processed image.
