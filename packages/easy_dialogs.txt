# Complete Example of Easy Dialogs in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:easy_dialogs/easy_dialogs.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Easy Dialogs Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Easy Dialogs Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Show an alert dialog when the button is pressed
              EasyDialog.showAlertDialog(
                context: context,
                title: 'Alert',
                message: 'This is an alert message.',
                onConfirm: () {
                  // Action to perform on confirmation
                  print('Alert confirmed!');
                },
              );
            },
            child: Text('Show Alert Dialog'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'Easy Dialogs Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 5. An ElevatedButton is created, which, when pressed, triggers the EasyDialog.showAlertDialog method.
// 6. The alert dialog displays a title and message, and includes a confirmation action.
// 7. When the user confirms the dialog, a message is printed to the console.
