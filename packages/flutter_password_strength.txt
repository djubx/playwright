<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Flutter Password Strength Package

The `flutter_password_strength` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to enhance the security of their applications by implementing password strength validation. This package provides a simple way to assess the strength of a password based on various criteria, helping users create stronger passwords and reducing the risk of security breaches.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `flutter_password_strength` package in scenarios such as:

- **User Registration**: When users create accounts, you can guide them to choose strong passwords.
- **Password Change**: During password updates, ensure that the new password meets security standards.
- **Security Audits**: If your application requires regular password updates, this package can help enforce strong password policies.

## Features

- **Real-time Password Strength Evaluation**: As users type their passwords, the package evaluates the strength and provides immediate feedback.
- **Customizable Strength Criteria**: You can define what constitutes a strong password based on length, character variety, and more.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The package integrates seamlessly with Flutter's widget system, allowing for easy customization and styling.

In summary, the `flutter_password_strength` package is an essential tool for any Flutter application that prioritizes user security and password management.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_password_strength

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_password_strength` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_password_strength: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_password_strength/flutter_password_strength.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

You can use the `PasswordStrength` widget to evaluate the strength of a password. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
PasswordStrength passwordStrength = PasswordStrength(password: 'your_password_here');
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Customizing Password Strength Criteria

You can customize the criteria for password strength by using the `PasswordStrength` class. For example:

```dart
final strength = PasswordStrength(
  password: 'your_password_here',
  minLength: 8,
  upperCase: true,
  numbers: true,
  specialChars: true,
);
```

This allows you to enforce specific rules for what constitutes a strong password.

## Step 5: Displaying Password Strength

You can display the password strength to users using a simple widget:

```dart
Text('Password Strength: ${strength.toString()}');
```

This will give users immediate feedback on their password choices.

With these steps, you can effectively implement the `flutter_password_strength` package in your Flutter application, ensuring that your users create strong and secure passwords.

# Complete Example of flutter_password_strength

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_password_strength/flutter_password_strength.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Password Strength Demo',
      home: PasswordStrengthDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class PasswordStrengthDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PasswordStrengthDemoState createState() => _PasswordStrengthDemoState();
}

class _PasswordStrengthDemoState extends State<PasswordStrengthDemo> {
  String _password = '';
  PasswordStrength _strength = PasswordStrength.weak;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Password Strength Checker'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              // TextField for user to input password
              onChanged: (value) {
                setState(() {
                  _password = value; // Update password state
                  _strength = PasswordStrength(password: _password); // Evaluate strength
                });
              },
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Enter Password',
                border: OutlineInputBorder(),
              ),
              obscureText: true, // Hide password input
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Display password strength
            Text('Password Strength: ${_strength.toString()}'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Provide feedback based on strength
            if (_strength == PasswordStrength.weak)
              Text('Your password is weak. Try adding more characters and variety.'),
            else if (_strength == PasswordStrength.medium)
              Text('Your password is medium. Consider adding special characters.'),
            else if (_strength == PasswordStrength.strong)
              Text('Your password is strong! Good job!'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up a MaterialApp with a title and home widget.
// 3. PasswordStrengthDemo is a stateful widget that manages the password input and its strength.
// 4. The user enters a password in the TextField, which triggers the onChanged callback.
// 5. The password is updated in the state, and the strength is evaluated using the PasswordStrength class.
// 6. The strength is displayed to the user, along with feedback based on the strength level.
// 7. The UI updates in real-time as the user types, providing immediate feedback on password strength.
```
