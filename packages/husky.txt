# Husky Flutter Package: An Overview

The **Husky** Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to enhance the development workflow by providing pre-commit hooks and other Git hooks. It allows developers to automate tasks such as running tests, linting code, or formatting files before committing changes to a repository. This ensures that the codebase remains clean and consistent, reducing the likelihood of errors and improving overall code quality.

## When to Use Husky

- **Code Quality Assurance**: Use Husky to enforce code quality checks before code is committed. This can include running unit tests, checking for linting errors, or ensuring code formatting standards are met.
- **Team Collaboration**: In a team setting, Husky helps maintain a consistent codebase by ensuring all team members adhere to the same pre-commit standards.
- **Automated Workflows**: Automate repetitive tasks that need to be performed before every commit, saving time and reducing manual errors.

## Features

- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automatically run scripts before commits to ensure code quality.
- **Customizable Hooks**: Easily configure which scripts to run at different stages of the Git lifecycle.
- **Cross-platform Support**: Works seamlessly across different operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

# Setting Up Husky in Your Flutter Project

Integrating Husky into your Flutter project involves a few straightforward steps. Below is a detailed guide to help you set up and configure Husky for both Android and iOS platforms.

## Step 1: Install Husky

First, ensure you have Node.js installed on your system, as Husky is a Node-based package. Then, navigate to your Flutter project directory and run the following command to install Husky:

```bash
npm install husky --save-dev
```

## Step 2: Initialize Husky

Initialize Husky in your project to set up the necessary Git hooks:

```bash
npx husky install
```

This command creates a `.husky` directory in your project, where all hook scripts will be stored.

## Step 3: Add a Pre-commit Hook

Create a pre-commit hook to run Flutter tests before each commit:

```bash
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "flutter test"
```

This command adds a script to the `.husky/pre-commit` file that runs `flutter test` whenever a commit is made.

## Platform-specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `build.gradle` file is configured to run tests and other scripts as needed. Husky will automatically handle the pre-commit hooks, so no additional Android-specific configuration is required.

### iOS

Similarly, for iOS, ensure your Xcode project is set up to run tests. Husky will manage the hooks, so no extra iOS-specific setup is necessary.

## Optimizations

- **Script Performance**: Ensure that the scripts you run with Husky are optimized for performance to avoid slowing down the commit process.
- **Selective Hooks**: Use Husky's ability to run different scripts at different stages to optimize your workflow. For example, run linting on pre-commit and full tests on pre-push.

# Complete Example: Flutter Main File with Husky

Below is a complete example of a Flutter main file that demonstrates the integration of Husky for running pre-commit hooks.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutterApp());
}

// The main widget of the application
class RealFlutterApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Husky Flutter Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

// The home page of the application
class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Husky Demo Home Page'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Welcome to the Husky Demo!',
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // This button simulates a commit action
                // In a real scenario, this would trigger a Git commit
                print('Running pre-commit hooks...');
              },
              child: Text('Simulate Commit'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The `main` function initializes the app by calling `runApp` with `RealFlutterApp`.
// 2. `RealFlutterApp` is a stateless widget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The `HomePage` widget is the main screen, displaying a welcome message and a button.
// 4. When the button is pressed, it simulates a commit action by printing a message to the console.
// 5. In a real-world scenario, Husky would run pre-commit hooks when a Git commit is made, ensuring code quality.
