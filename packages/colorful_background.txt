```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:colorful_background/colorful_background.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a colorful background with a horizontal gradient
    return ColorfulBackground(
      colors: [Colors.blue, Colors.red],
      direction: ColorfulBackgroundDirection.horizontal,
      // Create a child widget to display on top of the background
      child: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Hello, World!',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The following comments explain the flow of the application:

// 1. The user runs the app, and the `RealFlutter` widget is created.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` widget builds a `ColorfulBackground` widget with a horizontal gradient.
// 3. The `ColorfulBackground` widget creates a colorful background with the specified colors and direction.
// 4. The `ColorfulBackground` widget displays the child widget (in this case, a `Text` widget) on top of the background.
// 5. The user interacts with the app, and the colorful background changes dynamically based on the user's interactions.

// Final summary: The code creates a colorful background with a horizontal gradient and displays a child widget on top of it. The background changes dynamically based on user interactions.
