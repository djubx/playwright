Here's a detailed technical blog on the "hidable" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Hidable Flutter Package

The **hidable** Flutter package is a powerful tool that allows developers to create widgets that can be shown or hidden based on user interactions or specific conditions. This package is particularly useful for creating dynamic user interfaces where certain elements need to be displayed or concealed based on user actions, such as toggling visibility for additional information, forms, or menus.

## When to Use Hidable

You might consider using the **hidable** package in scenarios such as:
- **Dynamic Forms**: Show or hide form fields based on user selections.
- **Expandable Lists**: Allow users to expand or collapse list items to view more details.
- **Conditional UI Elements**: Display additional options or settings based on user preferences.

## Features

- **Simple API**: The package provides an easy-to-use API for toggling visibility.
- **Animation Support**: Smooth transitions when showing or hiding widgets.
- **Customizable**: Options to customize the animation duration and curve.

With these features, the **hidable** package enhances the user experience by making interfaces more interactive and responsive.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Hidable

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the **hidable** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  hidable: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:hidable/hidable.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using Hidable in Your Widget

You can use the `Hidable` widget to wrap any widget you want to show or hide. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
Hidable(
  visible: _isVisible, // A boolean that controls visibility
  child: Text('This text can be hidden or shown!'),
)
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Customizing Animation

You can customize the animation duration and curve by using the `Hidable` widget's properties:

```dart
Hidable(
  visible: _isVisible,
  duration: Duration(milliseconds: 300),
  curve: Curves.easeInOut,
  child: Text('This text can be hidden or shown!'),
)
```

With these steps, you can easily integrate the **hidable** package into your Flutter application and create dynamic, interactive UIs.

# Complete Example of Hidable in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:hidable/hidable.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // State variable to control visibility
  bool _isVisible = false;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Hidable Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Button to toggle visibility
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Toggle the visibility state
                  setState(() {
                    _isVisible = !_isVisible;
                  });
                },
                child: Text(_isVisible ? 'Hide Text' : 'Show Text'),
              ),
              // Hidable widget that shows/hides the text
              Hidable(
                visible: _isVisible,
                duration: Duration(milliseconds: 300), // Animation duration
                curve: Curves.easeInOut, // Animation curve
                child: Text(
                  'This text can be hidden or shown!',
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains the visibility state of the text.
// 3. The _isVisible boolean variable controls whether the text is shown or hidden.
// 4. The build method creates a simple UI with a button and a Hidable widget.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the setState method is called to toggle _isVisible.
// 6. The Hidable widget listens to the _isVisible variable and shows or hides the text accordingly.
// 7. The text appears or disappears with a smooth animation defined by the duration and curve properties.
```
