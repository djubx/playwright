## <-- START_DESCRIPTION -->

### Description

The `flutter_adaptive_layout` package is designed to help Flutter developers create responsive and adaptive user interfaces that work seamlessly across different platforms, including mobile (iOS and Android) and web. This package simplifies the process of building layouts that adjust to various screen sizes and orientations, ensuring a consistent user experience.

### When to Use

You should consider using `flutter_adaptive_layout` when:
- You are developing applications that need to run on multiple platforms.
- You want to create a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.
- You aim to reduce the complexity of managing different layouts for various devices.

### Features

- **Adaptive Widgets**: Provides a set of widgets that automatically adjust their layout based on the platform and screen size.
- **Responsive Design**: Simplifies the implementation of responsive design principles, allowing for fluid layouts.

### Tutorial

#### Installation

To get started with the `flutter_adaptive_layout` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_adaptive_layout: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_adaptive_layout).

#### Setup for Android and iOS

1. **Android**: No additional setup is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

2. **iOS**: For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

#### Basic Usage

To use the `flutter_adaptive_layout` package, you can wrap your main widget with `AdaptiveLayout` and define your adaptive widgets based on the platform.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_adaptive_layout/flutter_adaptive_layout.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return AdaptiveLayout(
      mobile: MobileLayout(),
      tablet: TabletLayout(),
      desktop: DesktopLayout(),
    );
  }
}

class MobileLayout extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Mobile Layout')),
      body: Center(child: Text('This is a mobile layout')),
    );
  }
}

class TabletLayout extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Tablet Layout')),
      body: Center(child: Text('This is a tablet layout')),
    );
  }
}

class DesktopLayout extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Desktop Layout')),
      body: Center(child: Text('This is a desktop layout')),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `AdaptiveLayout` widget automatically selects the appropriate layout based on the device type.

### Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_adaptive_layout/flutter_adaptive_layout.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Adaptive Layout Example',
      home: RealFlutter(), // Main entry point for adaptive layout
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Using AdaptiveLayout to switch between layouts based on device type
    return AdaptiveLayout(
      mobile: MobileLayout(), // Mobile layout for small screens
      tablet: TabletLayout(), // Tablet layout for medium screens
      desktop: DesktopLayout(), // Desktop layout for large screens
    );
  }
}

class MobileLayout extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Scaffold for mobile layout
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Mobile Layout')),
      body: Center(child: Text('This is a mobile layout')),
    );
  }
}

class TabletLayout extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Scaffold for tablet layout
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Tablet Layout')),
      body: Center(child: Text('This is a tablet layout')),
    );
  }
}

class DesktopLayout extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Scaffold for desktop layout
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Desktop Layout')),
      body: Center(child: Text('This is a desktop layout')),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp and points to RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter uses AdaptiveLayout to determine which layout to display based on the device type.
// 4. Depending on whether the app is running on mobile, tablet, or desktop, the corresponding layout (MobileLayout, TabletLayout, or DesktopLayout) is displayed.
// 5. Each layout has its own Scaffold with an AppBar and a centered text widget indicating the type of layout being shown.
