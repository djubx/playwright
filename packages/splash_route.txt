# Overview of the splash_route Flutter Package

The `splash_route` package is a Flutter library designed to simplify the implementation of splash screens and transitions between routes in your Flutter applications. It provides a seamless way to create visually appealing splash screens that enhance user experience by providing a smooth transition from the splash screen to the main content of the app.

## When to Use This Package
- **Onboarding Experiences**: When you want to introduce users to your app with a visually engaging splash screen.
- **Branding**: To showcase your brand logo or theme while the app is loading.
- **Loading States**: When you need to indicate that the app is processing or loading data before displaying the main content.

## Key Features
- **Customizable Splash Screens**: Easily customize the appearance of your splash screen with images, colors, and animations.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Provides built-in animations for transitioning from the splash screen to the main application.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Allows for various configurations to suit different app requirements, including duration and transition effects.

Overall, `splash_route` is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to enhance their app's user interface with engaging splash screens and smooth transitions.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using splash_route

## Installation
To use the `splash_route` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  splash_route: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/splash_route).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions and configurations. Typically, no additional configurations are required for `splash_route`, but make sure your app's theme is set correctly.

### iOS
For iOS, you may want to customize the launch screen in `LaunchScreen.storyboard` to match your splash screen design. This is not mandatory but can enhance the user experience.

## Basic Usage
To use the `splash_route` package, you need to set up your main application file to include the splash screen. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:
   ```dart
   import 'package:splash_route/splash_route.dart';
   ```

2. Create a splash screen widget:
   ```dart
   class MySplashScreen extends StatelessWidget {
     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return Scaffold(
         backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
         body: Center(
           child: Text(
             'Welcome to My App',
             style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.white),
           ),
         ),
       );
     }
   }
   ```

3. Set up the main application with the splash route:
   ```dart
   void main() {
     runApp(MaterialApp(
       home: SplashRoute(
         splash: MySplashScreen(),
         next: HomeScreen(),
         duration: 3000, // Duration in milliseconds
       ),
     ));
   }
   ```

This setup will display the `MySplashScreen` for 3 seconds before navigating to the `HomeScreen`.

# Complete Example of Using splash_route

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:splash_route/splash_route.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Splash Route Example',
      home: SplashRoute(
        splash: MySplashScreen(), // The splash screen widget
        next: HomeScreen(), // The next screen after the splash
        duration: 3000, // Duration for the splash screen
      ),
    );
  }
}

// This is the splash screen widget
class MySplashScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      backgroundColor: Colors.blue, // Background color of the splash screen
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Welcome to My App', // Text displayed on the splash screen
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.white), // Text style
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// This is the main screen of the application
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Screen'), // Title of the app bar
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'This is the Home Screen', // Text displayed on the home screen
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20), // Text style
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up a MaterialApp with a SplashRoute as the home.
// 3. The SplashRoute displays MySplashScreen for 3000 milliseconds (3 seconds).
// 4. After the duration, it automatically navigates to HomeScreen.
// 5. HomeScreen displays a simple message indicating that the user is on the main screen.
