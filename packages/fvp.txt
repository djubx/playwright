# fvp Flutter Package

The **fvp** (Flutter Video Player) package is a powerful tool for integrating video playback capabilities into Flutter applications. It provides a simple and efficient way to play videos from various sources, including local files and network URLs. The package is designed to be easy to use while offering a range of features that cater to both basic and advanced video playback needs.

## When to Use fvp

You should consider using the fvp package in scenarios such as:
- Building media applications that require video playback.
- Creating educational apps that include video tutorials.
- Developing social media apps where users can upload and view videos.
- Implementing video backgrounds or overlays in your UI.

## Features

- **Customizable Controls**: Offers built-in controls for play, pause, and seek functionalities.
- **Full-Screen Mode**: Supports full-screen video playback.
- **Event Handling**: Provides callbacks for various video events (e.g., play, pause, finish).

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using fvp

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the fvp package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the fvp package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  fvp: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/fvp).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open the `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open the `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions to allow video playback:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the camera for video recording.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the microphone for audio recording.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the fvp Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to implement video playback using the fvp package.

<!-- END_TUTORIAL -->

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fvp/fvp.dart'; // Importing the fvp package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the RealFlutter app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Video Player',
      home: VideoPlayerScreen(), // Setting the home screen to VideoPlayerScreen
    );
  }
}

class VideoPlayerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _VideoPlayerScreenState createState() => _VideoPlayerScreenState();
}

class _VideoPlayerScreenState extends State<VideoPlayerScreen> {
  late FvpController _controller; // Controller for managing video playback
  final String videoUrl = 'https://www.example.com/video.mp4'; // URL of the video

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _controller = FvpController.network(videoUrl); // Initializing the controller with the video URL
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _controller.dispose(); // Disposing the controller when the widget is removed
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Video Player'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Video player widget
            Fvp(
              controller: _controller,
              aspectRatio: 16 / 9, // Setting the aspect ratio for the video
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Spacing between video and buttons
            // Play button
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                _controller.play(); // Play the video
              },
              child: Text('Play'),
            ),
            // Pause button
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                _controller.pause(); // Pause the video
              },
              child: Text('Pause'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. The home screen is set to VideoPlayerScreen, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 4. In the VideoPlayerScreen, we initialize the FvpController with a video URL.
// 5. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 6. Inside the Center widget, we display the Fvp video player and two buttons for play and pause.
// 7. The play and pause buttons control the video playback using the controller.
```

In this blog, we have covered the fvp Flutter package, including its description, setup tutorial, and a complete example. The application flow is straightforward, allowing developers to easily integrate video playback into their Flutter applications. By following the steps outlined, you can create a functional video player that enhances user engagement in your app.
