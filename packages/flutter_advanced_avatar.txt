# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_advanced_avatar

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `flutter_advanced_avatar` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_advanced_avatar: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to create an avatar using the `flutter_advanced_avatar` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_advanced_avatar/flutter_advanced_avatar.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Advanced Avatar Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: AdvancedAvatar(
            size: 100, // Set the size of the avatar
            image: NetworkImage('https://example.com/user_image.png'), // User image URL
            fallback: Text('AB'), // Fallback initials
            shape: AvatarShape.circle, // Avatar shape
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays an avatar in the center of the screen. The avatar will show the user's image if available; otherwise, it will display the initials "AB".

# Complete Example of flutter_advanced_avatar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_advanced_avatar/flutter_advanced_avatar.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Advanced Avatar Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Displaying a circular avatar with a network image
              AdvancedAvatar(
                size: 100, // Set the size of the avatar
                image: NetworkImage('https://example.com/user_image.png'), // User image URL
                fallback: Text('AB'), // Fallback initials
                shape: AvatarShape.circle, // Avatar shape
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between avatars
              // Displaying a square avatar with initials
              AdvancedAvatar(
                size: 80, // Set the size of the avatar
                fallback: Text('CD'), // Fallback initials
                shape: AvatarShape.square, // Avatar shape
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to stack two AdvancedAvatar widgets vertically.
// 4. The first AdvancedAvatar attempts to load an image from a network URL. If the image is not available, it displays the initials "AB".
// 5. The second AdvancedAvatar is a square avatar that displays the initials "CD" since no image is provided.
// 6. The avatars are displayed in the center of the screen, demonstrating the package's capabilities.
