# Setting Up and Using the Flutter Pie Chart Package

## Installation
To use the `flutter_pie_chart` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_pie_chart: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if you plan to use any features that require user permissions. However, for basic usage of the pie chart, no special configurations are needed.

## Basic Usage
To use the `flutter_pie_chart` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_pie_chart/flutter_pie_chart.dart';
```

You can then create a simple pie chart by providing the necessary data and configuration options. Below is a basic example of how to implement a pie chart in your Flutter application.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_pie_chart/flutter_pie_chart.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Pie Chart Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Pie Chart Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: PieChart(
            data: {
              "Category A": 30,
              "Category B": 20,
              "Category C": 50,
            },
            chartType: ChartType.disc, // Type of pie chart
            colorList: [Colors.red, Colors.blue, Colors.green], // Colors for each segment
            animationDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 800), // Animation duration
            chartLegendSpacing: 32.0, // Spacing for the legend
            initialAngleInDegree: 0, // Initial angle for the pie chart
            chartRadius: MediaQuery.of(context).size.width / 3, // Radius of the chart
            centerText: "Categories", // Center text in the pie chart
            legendOptions: LegendOptions(
              showLegends: true, // Show legends
              legendPosition: LegendPosition.right, // Position of the legend
            ),
            ringStrokeWidth: 32, // Width of the ring stroke
            totalValue: 100, // Total value for the pie chart
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The above code creates a simple Flutter application that displays a pie chart.
// 1. The main function runs the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Flutter Pie Chart Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers a PieChart widget.
// 5. The PieChart is configured with data representing three categories, each with a specific value.
// 6. The chart type is set to 'disc', and colors are assigned to each segment.
// 7. Animation duration and other visual properties are configured for a better user experience.
// 8. The chart is responsive, adapting to the screen size, and displays a legend on the right side.
