- You want to provide users with an interactive way to select and manage time intervals.

## Features

- **Customizable Time Slots**: Easily define the duration and intervals of time slots.
- **Interactive UI**: Users can interact with the schedule to select or modify time slots.
- **Flexible Layout**: Supports various layouts to fit different design requirements.
- **Event Handling**: Built-in support for handling events when time slots are selected or modified.

With these features, the **time_scheduler_table** package simplifies the process of implementing scheduling functionalities in Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Time Scheduler Table Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **time_scheduler_table** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  time_scheduler_table: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # Ensure this is set to at least 10.0
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the **time_scheduler_table** in your app.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:time_scheduler_table/time_scheduler_table.dart';
```

2. Create a basic layout using the `TimeSchedulerTable` widget:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Time Scheduler Table Example')),
        body: TimeSchedulerTable(
          // Define your time slots and other properties here
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Customize the `TimeSchedulerTable` with your desired configurations, such as time intervals, slot duration, and event handlers.

With these steps, you can successfully integrate the **time_scheduler_table** package into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Time Scheduler Table

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:time_scheduler_table/time_scheduler_table.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Time Scheduler Table Example')),
        body: TimeSchedulerTable(
          // Define the time slots for the scheduler
          timeSlots: [
            TimeSlot(start: TimeOfDay(hour: 9, minute: 0), end: TimeOfDay(hour: 10, minute: 0)),
            TimeSlot(start: TimeOfDay(hour: 10, minute: 0), end: TimeOfDay(hour: 11, minute: 0)),
            TimeSlot(start: TimeOfDay(hour: 11, minute: 0), end: TimeOfDay(hour: 12, minute: 0)),
          ],
          // Handle slot selection
          onSlotSelected: (TimeSlot selectedSlot) {
            // Show a dialog with the selected time slot
            showDialog(
              context: context,
              builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                title: Text('Slot Selected'),
                content: Text('You selected: ${selectedSlot.start.format(context)} - ${selectedSlot.end.format(context)}'),
                actions: [
                  TextButton(
                    onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                    child: Text('OK'),
                  ),
                ],
              ),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which builds a MaterialApp.
// 2. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a body.
// 3. The body contains the TimeSchedulerTable widget, which is configured with time slots.
// 4. When a user selects a time slot, the onSlotSelected callback is triggered.
// 5. An AlertDialog is displayed, showing the selected time slot to the user.
// 6. The user can dismiss the dialog by pressing the 'OK' button.
