# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Open File Safe Plus

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `open_file_safe_plus` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  open_file_safe_plus: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/open_file_safe_plus).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request permission for file access:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to open files.</string>
<key>NSDocumentsUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your documents to open files.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to open a file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:open_file_safe_plus/open_file_safe_plus.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Open File Safe Plus Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Specify the file path
              String filePath = '/path/to/your/file.pdf';
              
              // Open the file
              final result = await OpenFile.open(filePath);
              
              // Handle the result
              if (result.type == ResultType.done) {
                print('File opened successfully');
              } else {
                print('Error opening file: ${result.message}');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Open File'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, the specified file will be opened using the default application associated with that file type. The result of the operation is then printed to the console.

# Complete Example of Open File Safe Plus

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:open_file_safe_plus/open_file_safe_plus.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Open File Safe Plus Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Specify the file path
              String filePath = '/path/to/your/file.pdf'; // Change this to your file path
              
              // Open the file using the open_file_safe_plus package
              final result = await OpenFile.open(filePath);
              
              // Check the result of the file opening operation
              if (result.type == ResultType.done) {
                // If the file opened successfully, print a success message
                print('File opened successfully');
              } else {
                // If there was an error, print the error message
                print('Error opening file: ${result.message}');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Open File'), // Button text
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and displays a button labeled "Open File".
// 2. When the button is pressed, the specified file path is defined.
// 3. The OpenFile.open method is called with the file path, which attempts to open the file.
// 4. The result of the operation is awaited, and based on the result type, a success or error message is printed to the console.
// 5. This allows users to open files securely and handle any potential errors gracefully.
```
