# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Country List Picker

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the `country_list_picker` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  country_list_picker: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` to allow for network requests if your app fetches data from the internet. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Using the Package
Now that the package is set up, you can use it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the country picker in your app.

# Complete Example of Using Country List Picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:country_list_picker/country_list_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Country List Picker Example',
      home: CountryPickerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class CountryPickerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CountryPickerScreenState createState() => _CountryPickerScreenState();
}

class _CountryPickerScreenState extends State<CountryPickerScreen> {
  String? selectedCountry; // Variable to hold the selected country

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Select Your Country'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the selected country or a placeholder
            Text(
              selectedCountry ?? 'No country selected',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to open the country picker
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Open the country list picker
                showCountryPicker();
              },
              child: Text('Pick a Country'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void showCountryPicker() {
    // Show the country picker dialog
    showDialog(
      context: context,
      builder: (context) {
        return CountryListPicker(
          onChanged: (CountryCode code) {
            // Update the selected country when a country is picked
            setState(() {
              selectedCountry = code.name; // Store the country name
            });
            Navigator.pop(context); // Close the dialog
          },
          // Optional: Customize the dialog appearance
          theme: CountryTheme(
            backgroundColor: Colors.white,
            primaryColor: Colors.blue,
            textStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.black),
          ),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (CountryPickerScreen).
// 3. CountryPickerScreen maintains the state of the selected country.
// 4. When the user taps the "Pick a Country" button, the showCountryPicker method is called.
// 5. This method opens a dialog with the country list picker.
// 6. When a country is selected, the onChanged callback updates the selectedCountry variable and closes the dialog.
// 7. The selected country is displayed on the main screen.
```
