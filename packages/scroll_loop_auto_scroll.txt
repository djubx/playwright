# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Scroll Loop Auto Scroll Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `scroll_loop_auto_scroll` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  scroll_loop_auto_scroll: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `scroll_loop_auto_scroll` package in your app.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:scroll_loop_auto_scroll/scroll_loop_auto_scroll.dart';
```

2. Create a widget that uses the `ScrollLoopAutoScroll` class to display a list of items.

### Example Code Snippet

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Scroll Loop Auto Scroll Example')),
      body: ScrollLoopAutoScroll(
        items: List.generate(20, (index) => 'Item $index'),
        scrollDirection: Axis.vertical,
        scrollSpeed: 50.0,
        pauseDuration: Duration(seconds: 2),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a vertical scrolling list of items that scrolls at a speed of 50.0 pixels per second and pauses for 2 seconds at the end of the list.

## Conclusion

You are now ready to implement the `scroll_loop_auto_scroll` package in your Flutter applications. This package provides a simple yet effective way to enhance user experience through smooth and continuous scrolling.

# Complete Example of Using Scroll Loop Auto Scroll

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:scroll_loop_auto_scroll/scroll_loop_auto_scroll.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Scroll Loop Auto Scroll Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Scroll Loop Auto Scroll Example')),
      body: ScrollLoopAutoScroll(
        items: List.generate(20, (index) => 'Item $index'), // Generate a list of 20 items
        scrollDirection: Axis.vertical, // Set the scroll direction to vertical
        scrollSpeed: 50.0, // Set the speed of scrolling
        pauseDuration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Pause for 2 seconds at the end
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body containing the ScrollLoopAutoScroll widget.
// 4. ScrollLoopAutoScroll generates a list of 20 items, scrolling vertically at a speed of 50.0 pixels per second.
// 5. The scrolling pauses for 2 seconds when reaching the end of the list, creating a smooth user experience.
