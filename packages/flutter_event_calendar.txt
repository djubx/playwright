// This is the main entry point of the app.
// The `MyApp` widget is the root of the app, and it contains the `RealFlutter` widget.
// The `RealFlutter` widget is a stateful widget that contains the calendar.
// The calendar is created using the `CalendarWidget` and is passed the `_events` list.
// The `_events` list contains two events, each with a title, start date, and end date.
// The calendar layout is customized using the `CalendarLayout` object.
// The `CalendarLayout` object sets the header height and day of week height.

// When the app is run, the calendar is displayed with the two events.
// The user can navigate between months using the swipe gestures.
// The events are displayed on the calendar, and the user can tap on an event to view its details.
