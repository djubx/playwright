# Setting Up and Using the Flutter Event Calendar Package

## Installation
To get started with the `flutter_event_calendar` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_event_calendar: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable permissions for calendar access. Open your `Info.plist` file and add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSCalendarsUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your calendar.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `flutter_event_calendar` package, you can create a simple calendar widget in your Flutter application. Below is a basic example of how to implement the calendar.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_event_calendar/flutter_event_calendar.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Event Calendar Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Event Calendar'),
        ),
        body: EventCalendar(
          onEventTap: (event) {
            // Handle event tap
            print('Event tapped: ${event.title}');
          },
          events: [
            Event(
              title: 'Meeting',
              start: DateTime.now(),
              end: DateTime.now().add(Duration(hours: 1)),
            ),
            Event(
              title: 'Conference',
              start: DateTime.now().add(Duration(days: 1)),
              end: DateTime.now().add(Duration(days: 1, hours: 2)),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple calendar that displays two events. The `onEventTap` callback allows you to handle taps on events.

# Complete Example of Flutter Event Calendar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_event_calendar/flutter_event_calendar.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Event Calendar Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Event Calendar'),
        ),
        body: EventCalendar(
          onEventTap: (event) {
            // Handle event tap
            print('Event tapped: ${event.title}');
          },
          events: [
            Event(
              title: 'Meeting',
              start: DateTime.now(),
              end: DateTime.now().add(Duration(hours: 1)),
            ),
            Event(
              title: 'Conference',
              start: DateTime.now().add(Duration(days: 1)),
              end: DateTime.now().add(Duration(days: 1, hours: 2)),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the `RealFlutter` class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The `MaterialApp` widget is created, setting the title of the app.
// 3. A `Scaffold` widget is used to provide a structure for the app, including an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The `EventCalendar` widget is instantiated, which is the main component of the package.
// 5. The `onEventTap` callback is defined to handle taps on events, printing the event title to the console.
// 6. Two events are created and passed to the `events` parameter of the `EventCalendar`.
// 7. The first event is a meeting scheduled for the current time, and the second is a conference scheduled for the next day.
// 8. When the user taps on an event, the title of the event is printed to the console, demonstrating how to handle event interactions.
