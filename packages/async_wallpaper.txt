# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using async_wallpaper

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `async_wallpaper` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  async_wallpaper: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `AndroidManifest.xml` located in `android/app/src/main/`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SET_WALLPAPER"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SET_WALLPAPER_HINTS"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `Info.plist` located in `ios/Runner/`.
2. Add the following key to request permission for setting wallpapers:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your photo library to set wallpapers.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set a wallpaper:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:async_wallpaper/async_wallpaper.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Async Wallpaper Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Set wallpaper from an image URL
              String imageUrl = 'https://example.com/path/to/image.jpg';
              await AsyncWallpaper.setWallpaperFromUrl(imageUrl);
            },
            child: Text('Set Wallpaper'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, the app will set the wallpaper using an image from a URL.

# Complete Example of async_wallpaper

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:async_wallpaper/async_wallpaper.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Async Wallpaper Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Define the image URL to be set as wallpaper
              String imageUrl = 'https://example.com/path/to/image.jpg';
              
              // Call the method to set the wallpaper from the URL
              await AsyncWallpaper.setWallpaperFromUrl(imageUrl);
            },
            child: Text('Set Wallpaper'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The MaterialApp widget is created, providing the basic structure of the app.
// 3. A Scaffold widget is used to create the app's visual layout, including an AppBar and a body.
// 4. In the body, a Center widget is used to center the content.
// 5. An ElevatedButton is created, which, when pressed, triggers the onPressed callback.
// 6. Inside the onPressed callback, an image URL is defined.
// 7. The AsyncWallpaper.setWallpaperFromUrl method is called with the image URL to set the wallpaper.
// 8. The app provides feedback to the user by changing the wallpaper without blocking the UI.
