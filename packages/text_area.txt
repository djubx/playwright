### Tutorial

To get started with the `text_area` package, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the `text_area` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  text_area: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

#### Step 2: Install the Package

Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

#### Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

For both Android and iOS, no additional configuration is typically required for the `text_area` package. However, ensure that your Flutter environment is set up correctly for both platforms.

- **Android**: Ensure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
  
  ```groovy
  android {
      ...
      defaultConfig {
          ...
          minSdkVersion 21
      }
  }
  ```

- **iOS**: Make sure your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`.

  ```ruby
  platform :ios, '10.0'
  ```

#### Step 4: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the `text_area` package:

```dart
import 'package:text_area/text_area.dart';
```

#### Step 5: Using the Text Area

You can now use the `TextArea` widget in your Flutter application. Here’s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
TextArea(
  maxLines: 5,
  placeholder: 'Type your message here...',
  onChanged: (text) {
    // Handle text changes
  },
)
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:text_area/text_area.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Text Area Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Text Area Demo'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Column(
            children: [
              // TextArea widget for user input
              TextArea(
                maxLines: 5, // Set maximum lines for the text area
                placeholder: 'Type your message here...', // Placeholder text
                onChanged: (text) {
                  // Handle text changes
                  print('Current input: $text'); // Print current input to console
                },
                decoration: InputDecoration(
                  border: OutlineInputBorder(), // Add border to the text area
                  labelText: 'Message', // Label for the text area
                ),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Add space between widgets
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Action to perform on button press
                  print('Submit button pressed');
                },
                child: Text('Submit'), // Button text
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Text Area Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold has a Padding widget to provide space around the content.
// 5. Inside the Padding, a Column widget is used to arrange the TextArea and a button vertically.
// 6. The TextArea widget allows users to input multi-line text, with a maximum of 5 lines.
// 7. The placeholder text guides users on what to input.
// 8. The onChanged callback prints the current input to the console whenever the text changes.
// 9. Below the TextArea, an ElevatedButton is provided to submit the input, which prints a message to the console when pressed.
