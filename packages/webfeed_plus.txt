// This is the main file of the Flutter application.
// It uses the `webfeed_plus` package to parse and generate RSS feeds.
// The application displays the title, link, and description of the feed,
// as well as a list of items in the feed.

// The `_MyHomePageState` class is the state of the `MyHomePage` widget.
// It contains the `_feed` variable, which is an instance of the `RssFeed` class.
// The `_feed` variable is used to store the parsed feed data.

// The `build` method of the `_MyHomePageState` class is used to build the UI of the application.
// It returns a `Scaffold` widget, which contains an `AppBar` and a `Center` widget.
// The `Center` widget contains a `Column` widget, which contains several `Text` widgets
// that display the title, link, and description of the feed.
// The `Column` widget also contains an `Expanded` widget, which contains a `ListView` widget.
// The `ListView` widget is used to display the list of items in the feed.

// The `ListView` widget uses a `ListView.builder` constructor to build the list of items.
// The `itemCount` property of the `ListView` widget is set to the length of the `_feed.items` list.
// The `itemBuilder` property of the `ListView` widget is a callback function that returns a `ListTile` widget
// for each item in the list.
// The `ListTile` widget contains a `Text` widget that displays the title of the item,
// and a `Text` widget that displays the description of the item.

// This is the end of the main file of the Flutter application.
