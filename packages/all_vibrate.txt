# Setup and Usage of the all_vibrate Package

## Installation

To use the `all_vibrate` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  all_vibrate: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permission:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.VIBRATE"/>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you need to ensure that your app has the appropriate settings in the `Info.plist` file. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>audio</string>
</array>
```

## Basic Usage

To use the `all_vibrate` package, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:all_vibrate/all_vibrate.dart';
```

You can then call the vibration methods provided by the package. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to trigger a vibration:

```dart
// Trigger a default vibration
AllVibrate.vibrate();
```

You can also specify a custom vibration pattern:

```dart
// Trigger a custom vibration pattern
AllVibrate.vibrateWithPattern([0, 500, 1000, 500, 2000]);
```

# Complete Example of Using all_vibrate

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:all_vibrate/all_vibrate.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Vibration Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Vibration Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Trigger a default vibration when the button is pressed
                  AllVibrate.vibrate();
                },
                child: Text('Vibrate'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Trigger a custom vibration pattern when the button is pressed
                  AllVibrate.vibrateWithPattern([0, 500, 1000, 500, 2000]);
                },
                child: Text('Custom Vibration'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Vibration Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains two buttons.
// 5. The first button triggers a default vibration when pressed, calling AllVibrate.vibrate().
// 6. The second button triggers a custom vibration pattern when pressed, calling AllVibrate.vibrateWithPattern() with a specified pattern.
// 7. The app provides immediate tactile feedback to the user upon button presses, enhancing the overall user experience.
