# Flutter Keyboard Visibility Web Package

The `flutter_keyboard_visibility_web` package is designed to help Flutter developers manage keyboard visibility in web applications. As web applications often have different behaviors compared to mobile applications, this package provides a way to detect when the keyboard is shown or hidden, allowing developers to adjust their UI accordingly.

## When to Use This Package
- **Responsive UI**: When you want to create a responsive user interface that adapts to the keyboard's visibility.
- **Form Handling**: In applications with forms, you may want to adjust the layout when the keyboard appears to ensure that input fields are not obscured.
- **User Experience**: To enhance user experience by providing visual feedback or adjusting layouts when the keyboard is active.

## Features
- **Keyboard Visibility Detection**: Easily detect when the keyboard is shown or hidden.
- **Stream-based API**: Provides a stream to listen for keyboard visibility changes, allowing for reactive programming.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly across different platforms, including web, Android, and iOS.

This package is particularly useful for developers looking to improve the usability of their web applications by managing keyboard interactions effectively.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_keyboard_visibility_web

## Installation
To use the `flutter_keyboard_visibility_web` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_keyboard_visibility_web: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_keyboard_visibility_web).

## Platform-Specific Details
### Web
For web applications, ensure that your Flutter web project is set up correctly. The package automatically handles keyboard visibility detection in web environments.

### Android and iOS
While this package is primarily focused on web, it can also be used in mobile applications. However, for mobile-specific keyboard handling, consider using the `flutter_keyboard_visibility` package, which is tailored for Android and iOS.

## Usage
To use the package, you need to wrap your application or specific widgets with the `KeyboardVisibilityProvider`. This allows you to listen for keyboard visibility changes.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_keyboard_visibility_web/flutter_keyboard_visibility_web.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return KeyboardVisibilityProvider(
      child: MaterialApp(
        home: Scaffold(
          appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Keyboard Visibility Example')),
          body: KeyboardVisibilityBuilder(
            builder: (context, isKeyboardVisible) {
              return Center(
                child: Column(
                  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
                  children: [
                    Text(
                      isKeyboardVisible ? 'Keyboard is visible' : 'Keyboard is hidden',
                      style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
                    ),
                    TextField(),
                  ],
                ),
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `KeyboardVisibilityBuilder` listens for keyboard visibility changes and updates the UI accordingly.

# Complete Example of flutter_keyboard_visibility_web

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_keyboard_visibility_web/flutter_keyboard_visibility_web.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Wrapping the app with KeyboardVisibilityProvider to listen for keyboard visibility changes
    return KeyboardVisibilityProvider(
      child: MaterialApp(
        home: Scaffold(
          appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Keyboard Visibility Example')),
          body: KeyboardVisibilityBuilder(
            builder: (context, isKeyboardVisible) {
              // The builder provides the current keyboard visibility state
              return Center(
                child: Column(
                  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
                  children: [
                    // Displaying text based on keyboard visibility
                    Text(
                      isKeyboardVisible ? 'Keyboard is visible' : 'Keyboard is hidden',
                      style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
                    ),
                    // A simple text field for user input
                    TextField(),
                  ],
                ),
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the main UI.
// 3. The KeyboardVisibilityProvider wraps the MaterialApp, enabling keyboard visibility detection.
// 4. Inside the Scaffold, a KeyboardVisibilityBuilder is used to listen for keyboard visibility changes.
// 5. The builder receives a boolean value (isKeyboardVisible) indicating the keyboard's state.
// 6. Based on the keyboard's visibility, the text displayed changes accordingly.
// 7. A TextField is provided for user input, which will trigger the keyboard when focused.
