# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Full Calendar Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **full_calendar** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  full_calendar: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/full_calendar).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if your calendar requires access to the device's calendar:

```xml
<key>NSCalendarsUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your calendar.</string>
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:full_calendar/full_calendar.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Calendar Widget

You can now use the `FullCalendar` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:full_calendar/full_calendar.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Full Calendar Example')),
        body: FullCalendar(
          onDaySelected: (date) {
            // Handle the day selection
            print('Selected date: $date');
          },
          events: [
            CalendarEvent(
              title: 'Event 1',
              date: DateTime.now(),
            ),
            CalendarEvent(
              title: 'Event 2',
              date: DateTime.now().add(Duration(days: 1)),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic calendar that displays two events and prints the selected date to the console.

# Complete Example of Full Calendar in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:full_calendar/full_calendar.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Full Calendar Example')),
        body: FullCalendar(
          // Callback when a day is selected
          onDaySelected: (date) {
            // Print the selected date to the console
            print('Selected date: $date');
          },
          // List of events to display on the calendar
          events: [
            CalendarEvent(
              title: 'Event 1', // Title of the event
              date: DateTime.now(), // Date of the event
            ),
            CalendarEvent(
              title: 'Event 2', // Title of the event
              date: DateTime.now().add(Duration(days: 1)), // Date of the event
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The main function is the entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a FullCalendar widget.
3. The FullCalendar widget displays a calendar interface and listens for day selection events.
4. When a user selects a date, the onDaySelected callback is triggered, printing the selected date to the console.
5. The calendar also displays two events: "Event 1" on the current date and "Event 2" on the next day.
6. This simple setup allows for further customization and functionality, such as adding more events or handling user interactions.
