import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_resume_template/flutter_resume_template.dart'; // Import the package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Resume Template',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue), // Set the theme color
      home: ResumePage(), // Set the home page to ResumePage
    );
  }
}

class ResumePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('My Resume')), // AppBar with title
      body: SingleChildScrollView(
        child: Column(
          children: [
            // Personal Information Section
            PersonalInfoSection(
              name: 'John Doe',
              title: 'Flutter Developer',
              email: 'john.doe@example.com',
              phone: '+1234567890',
            ),
            // Skills Section
            SkillsSection(
              skills: ['Flutter', 'Dart', 'Firebase', 'REST APIs'],
            ),
            // Work Experience Section
            WorkExperienceSection(
              experiences: [
                WorkExperience(
                  jobTitle: 'Senior Flutter Developer',
                  company: 'Tech Company',
                  duration: 'Jan 2020 - Present',
                  description: 'Developed mobile applications using Flutter.',
                ),
                WorkExperience(
                  jobTitle: 'Junior Flutter Developer',
                  company: 'Startup Inc.',
                  duration: 'Jan 2019 - Dec 2019',
                  description: 'Assisted in building Flutter applications.',
                ),
              ],
            ),
            // Education Section
            EducationSection(
              education: [
                Education(
                  degree: 'Bachelor of Science in Computer Science',
                  institution: 'University of Technology',
                  year: '2018',
                ),
              ],
            ),
            // Projects Section
            ProjectsSection(
              projects: [
                Project(
                  title: 'Portfolio Website',
                  description: 'A personal portfolio website built with Flutter.',
                ),
                Project(
                  title: 'Chat Application',
                  description: 'A real-time chat application using Firebase.',
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter class.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home page is set to ResumePage, which contains the main content of the resume.
// 4. The ResumePage is structured using a Scaffold with an AppBar and a SingleChildScrollView to allow scrolling.
// 5. Various sections of the resume (Personal Info, Skills, Work Experience, Education, Projects) are created using the respective widgets.
// 6. Each section is populated with relevant data, showcasing the user's qualifications and experiences.
