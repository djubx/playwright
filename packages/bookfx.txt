# Setting Up and Using BookFX

## Installation
To add the BookFX package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  bookfx: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/bookfx).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
After installation, you can start using BookFX in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to display a list of books.

1. Import the package:

```dart
import 'package:bookfx/bookfx.dart';
```

2. Create a simple widget to display books:

```dart
class BookList extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Book List')),
      body: BookFX(
        books: [
          Book(title: 'Flutter for Beginners', author: 'John Doe'),
          Book(title: 'Advanced Flutter', author: 'Jane Smith'),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic app that displays a list of books using the BookFX package.

# Complete Example of a Flutter Application Using BookFX

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bookfx/bookfx.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'BookFX Example',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: BookList(),
    );
  }
}

class BookList extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Scaffold provides a structure for the visual interface
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Book List')),
      body: BookFX(
        // List of books to display
        books: [
          Book(title: 'Flutter for Beginners', author: 'John Doe'),
          Book(title: 'Advanced Flutter', author: 'Jane Smith'),
          Book(title: 'Dart Programming', author: 'Alice Johnson'),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The main function initializes the app and sets up the MaterialApp.
// The RealFlutter class is the root widget that builds the app.
// The BookList widget is displayed as the home screen, which contains a list of books.
// The BookFX widget is used to display the list of books, each with a title and author.
// This structure allows for easy expansion, such as adding more features like search or filtering.
```
<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, the application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` widget. The `RealFlutter` widget sets up a `MaterialApp` with a title and theme. The `BookList` widget is the home screen, where the `BookFX` widget displays a list of books. Each book is represented by a `Book` object containing a title and an author.

This structure allows for easy expansion, such as adding more features like search or filtering. The BookFX package simplifies the process of managing and displaying book data, making it an excellent choice for any book-related application.
