```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  side_bar_custom: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/side_bar_custom).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `side_bar_custom` package, you can create a simple sidebar layout in your Flutter application. Below is a basic example of how to implement it.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:side_bar_custom/side_bar_custom.dart';
```

2. Create a StatefulWidget to manage the sidebar state:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  bool isOpen = false; // State variable to manage sidebar visibility

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: Row(
        children: [
          // Sidebar widget
          SideBarCustom(
            isOpen: isOpen,
            onToggle: () {
              setState(() {
                isOpen = !isOpen; // Toggle sidebar visibility
              });
            },
            items: [
              SideBarItem(icon: Icons.home, title: 'Home'),
              SideBarItem(icon: Icons.settings, title: 'Settings'),
              SideBarItem(icon: Icons.info, title: 'About'),
            ],
          ),
          // Main content area
          Expanded(
            child: Center(
              child: Text('Main Content Area'),
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic sidebar with three items: Home, Settings, and About. The sidebar can be toggled open and closed.

# Complete Example of `side_bar_custom`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:side_bar_custom/side_bar_custom.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sidebar Custom Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  bool isOpen = false; // State variable to manage sidebar visibility

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: Row(
        children: [
          // Sidebar widget
          SideBarCustom(
            isOpen: isOpen, // Pass the state variable to control visibility
            onToggle: () {
              setState(() {
                isOpen = !isOpen; // Toggle sidebar visibility
              });
            },
            items: [
              SideBarItem(icon: Icons.home, title: 'Home'), // First item
              SideBarItem(icon: Icons.settings, title: 'Settings'), // Second item
              SideBarItem(icon: Icons.info, title: 'About'), // Third item
            ],
          ),
          // Main content area
          Expanded(
            child: Center(
              child: Text('Main Content Area'), // Placeholder for main content
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets MyApp as the home widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home screen.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that manages the sidebar's open/close state.
// 4. The build method returns a Scaffold with a Row containing the sidebar and main content.
// 5. The SideBarCustom widget takes the isOpen state and a callback to toggle its visibility.
// 6. The sidebar contains three items: Home, Settings, and About, each represented by an icon and title.
// 7. The Expanded widget fills the remaining space with a centered text indicating the main content area.
