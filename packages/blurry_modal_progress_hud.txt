# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Blurry Modal Progress HUD

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To use the **blurry_modal_progress_hud** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  blurry_modal_progress_hud: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install the Package

Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

To use the **blurry_modal_progress_hud** in your Flutter application, follow these steps:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:blurry_modal_progress_hud/blurry_modal_progress_hud.dart';
```

2. Wrap your main widget with the `BlurryModalProgressHUD` widget. You can control the visibility of the HUD based on your loading state.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  bool _isLoading = false;

  void _simulateLoading() async {
    setState(() {
      _isLoading = true; // Show the loading HUD
    });

    // Simulate a network request or long-running task
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3));

    setState(() {
      _isLoading = false; // Hide the loading HUD
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return BlurryModalProgressHUD(
      inAsyncCall: _isLoading,
      child: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Blurry Modal Progress HUD Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: _simulateLoading,
            child: Text('Start Loading'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code demonstrates how to show the blurry modal progress HUD when a button is pressed, simulating a loading state.

# Complete Example of Blurry Modal Progress HUD

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:blurry_modal_progress_hud/blurry_modal_progress_hud.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  bool _isLoading = false; // State variable to track loading status

  // Function to simulate a loading process
  void _simulateLoading() async {
    setState(() {
      _isLoading = true; // Set loading state to true
    });

    // Simulate a network request or long-running task
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3)); // Wait for 3 seconds

    setState(() {
      _isLoading = false; // Set loading state to false
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return BlurryModalProgressHUD(
      inAsyncCall: _isLoading, // Show HUD based on loading state
      child: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Blurry Modal Progress HUD Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: _simulateLoading, // Start loading on button press
            child: Text('Start Loading'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The _isLoading variable is initialized to false, indicating no loading state.
// 3. When the user presses the "Start Loading" button, the _simulateLoading function is called.
// 4. Inside _simulateLoading, the loading state is set to true, which triggers the BlurryModalProgressHUD to display.
// 5. The app simulates a loading process with a 3-second delay.
// 6. After the delay, the loading state is set back to false, hiding the HUD.
// 7. The user can see the blurred background while the loading indicator is displayed.
```
