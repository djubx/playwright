# Overview of the `vm_snapshot_analysis` Flutter Package

The `vm_snapshot_analysis` package is a powerful tool designed for developers who need to analyze memory usage and performance in their Flutter applications. This package provides insights into the memory allocation and helps identify potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies in the app's runtime behavior.

## When to Use

- **Performance Optimization**: Use this package when you need to optimize your app's performance by analyzing memory usage patterns.
- **Debugging**: It is useful for debugging memory leaks or unexpected memory consumption.
- **Profiling**: Ideal for profiling applications to understand how memory is allocated and used over time.

## Features

- **Snapshot Analysis**: Capture and analyze memory snapshots to understand the allocation patterns.
- **Detailed Reports**: Generate detailed reports that highlight memory usage by different parts of the application.
- **Integration with DevTools**: Seamlessly integrates with Flutter DevTools for enhanced analysis capabilities.

# Setting Up and Using `vm_snapshot_analysis`

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `vm_snapshot_analysis` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter project.

## Setup Process

### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the `vm_snapshot_analysis` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  vm_snapshot_analysis: ^1.0.0
```

### Step 2: Install the Package

Run the following command to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android

Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

#### iOS

Make sure your iOS deployment target is set to 11.0 or higher in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '11.0'
```

### Step 4: Import the Package

Import the package in your Dart file where you intend to use it:

```dart
import 'package:vm_snapshot_analysis/vm_snapshot_analysis.dart';
```

## Using the Package

To use the `vm_snapshot_analysis` package, you need to capture a memory snapshot and then analyze it using the provided tools. Here is a basic example:

```dart
void analyzeMemory() {
  final snapshot = RealFlutter.captureSnapshot();
  final analysis = RealFlutter.analyzeSnapshot(snapshot);
  print(analysis.generateReport());
}
```

- **Capture Snapshot**: Use `RealFlutter.captureSnapshot()` to capture the current memory state.
- **Analyze Snapshot**: Use `RealFlutter.analyzeSnapshot(snapshot)` to analyze the captured snapshot.
- **Generate Report**: Use `analysis.generateReport()` to generate a detailed report of the memory usage.

# Complete Example of Using `vm_snapshot_analysis`

Below is a complete Flutter application demonstrating the use of the `vm_snapshot_analysis` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:vm_snapshot_analysis/vm_snapshot_analysis.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// Main application widget
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'VM Snapshot Analysis Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

// Home page widget
class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  String _report = 'No analysis yet.';

  // Function to perform memory analysis
  void _performAnalysis() {
    // Capture the current memory snapshot
    final snapshot = RealFlutter.captureSnapshot();
    // Analyze the captured snapshot
    final analysis = RealFlutter.analyzeSnapshot(snapshot);
    // Generate a report from the analysis
    setState(() {
      _report = analysis.generateReport();
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('VM Snapshot Analysis'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Memory Analysis Report:',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 10),
            Expanded(
              child: SingleChildScrollView(
                child: Text(_report),
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _performAnalysis,
              child: Text('Perform Analysis'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// Application Flow Explanation
// 1. The `main` function initializes the app by running `MyApp`.
// 2. `MyApp` is a stateless widget that sets up the MaterialApp with a home page.
// 3. `MyHomePage` is a stateful widget that manages the state of the memory analysis report.
// 4. `_performAnalysis` is a function that captures a memory snapshot, analyzes it, and updates the UI with the report.
// 5. The UI consists of a text widget displaying the report and a button to trigger the analysis.
// 6. When the button is pressed, `_performAnalysis` is called, updating the report displayed on the screen.
