# Smart Snackbars Flutter Package

The **smart_snackbars** package is a powerful and flexible solution for displaying snackbars in Flutter applications. Snackbars are brief messages that provide feedback about an operation in a way that doesn’t interrupt the user’s experience. This package enhances the default snackbar functionality by allowing developers to customize the appearance, behavior, and duration of snackbars, making them more informative and visually appealing.

## When to Use

You should consider using the **smart_snackbars** package when:
- You need to provide users with feedback on actions they have taken, such as saving data or completing a task.
- You want to display messages that require user acknowledgment but do not need to interrupt the flow of the application.
- You need customizable snackbars that can adapt to different themes and styles in your app.

## Features

- **Customizable Appearance**: Change colors, shapes, and text styles to match your app's theme.
- **Multiple Snackbar Types**: Support for different types of snackbars, such as success, error, and info.
- **Action Buttons**: Include action buttons that allow users to respond directly from the snackbar.
- **Duration Control**: Set how long the snackbar should be displayed before it disappears.
- **Animation Support**: Smooth animations for showing and hiding snackbars.

With these features, the **smart_snackbars** package provides a robust solution for enhancing user interaction in Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Smart Snackbars

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the **smart_snackbars** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  smart_snackbars: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:smart_snackbars/smart_snackbars.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

To display a snackbar, you can use the `SmartSnackbar` class. Here’s a simple example of how to show a snackbar when a button is pressed:

```dart
SmartSnackbar.show(
  context: context,
  message: "This is a smart snackbar!",
  duration: Duration(seconds: 2),
);
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the correct configurations. Typically, no additional configurations are needed for using snackbars, but ensure your app's theme supports Material Design.

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your app's deployment target is set to at least iOS 9.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
```

## Step 4: Customizing Snackbars

You can customize the appearance of the snackbar by providing additional parameters:

```dart
SmartSnackbar.show(
  context: context,
  message: "Operation Successful!",
  backgroundColor: Colors.green,
  textColor: Colors.white,
  action: SnackBarAction(
    label: 'Undo',
    onPressed: () {
      // Handle the action
    },
  ),
);
```

This customization allows you to create a more engaging user experience.

# Complete Example of Smart Snackbars

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:smart_snackbars/smart_snackbars.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Smart Snackbars Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Smart Snackbars Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Show a success snackbar when the button is pressed
            SmartSnackbar.show(
              context: context,
              message: "Data saved successfully!",
              backgroundColor: Colors.green,
              textColor: Colors.white,
              duration: Duration(seconds: 3),
              action: SnackBarAction(
                label: 'Undo',
                onPressed: () {
                  // Handle the undo action
                  SmartSnackbar.show(
                    context: context,
                    message: "Undo successful!",
                    backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
                    textColor: Colors.white,
                  );
                },
              ),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Save Data'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a HomeScreen as the home widget.
// 3. HomeScreen contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget that holds an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, a success snackbar is displayed with a message and an action button.
// 5. If the user presses the 'Undo' action, another snackbar is shown to confirm the undo action.
```
