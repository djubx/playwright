# Tutorial: Setting Up sn_progress_dialog

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `sn_progress_dialog` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `sn_progress_dialog` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  sn_progress_dialog: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Import the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the progress dialog, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:sn_progress_dialog/sn_progress_dialog.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Progress Dialog

### Basic Usage

To use the progress dialog, you need to create an instance of `ProgressDialog` and show it when starting a long-running task. Here’s a simple example:

```dart
ProgressDialog progressDialog = ProgressDialog(context);
progressDialog.show();
```

### Dismissing the Dialog

Once your task is complete, you can dismiss the dialog:

```dart
progressDialog.close();
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

#### iOS

For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Customization

You can customize the dialog by setting properties such as `msg`, `backgroundColor`, and `progressType`. Here’s an example of a customized dialog:

```dart
progressDialog = ProgressDialog(context);
progressDialog.style(
  message: 'Loading...',
  borderRadius: 10.0,
  backgroundColor: Colors.white,
  progressWidget: CircularProgressIndicator(),
);
```

With these steps, you can easily integrate and customize the `sn_progress_dialog` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of sn_progress_dialog

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sn_progress_dialog/sn_progress_dialog.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Progress Dialog Example',
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('sn_progress_dialog Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () async {
            // Create an instance of ProgressDialog
            ProgressDialog progressDialog = ProgressDialog(context);
            // Show the progress dialog
            progressDialog.show();
            // Simulate a long-running task
            await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3));
            // Close the progress dialog
            progressDialog.close();
            // Show a success message
            ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
              SnackBar(content: Text('Task Completed!')),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Start Task'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home page (MyHomePage).
// 3. MyHomePage contains a button that, when pressed, creates a ProgressDialog instance.
// 4. The dialog is shown immediately, indicating that a task is in progress.
// 5. A simulated long-running task is executed using Future.delayed for 3 seconds.
// 6. After the delay, the progress dialog is closed, and a SnackBar is displayed to inform the user that the task is completed.
```
