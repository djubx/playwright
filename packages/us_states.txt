- **Location-Based Services**: If your app offers services based on user location, you can easily access state data.
- **Data Representation**: For applications that display information based on U.S. states, such as statistics or demographics.

## Features

- **Comprehensive State List**: Access to all 50 U.S. states and their abbreviations.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate into any Flutter application.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead, ensuring your app remains performant.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the `us_states` Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `us_states` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  us_states: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:us_states/us_states.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

### Basic Usage

You can access the list of states and their abbreviations using the `USStates` class. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to retrieve and display the states:

```dart
List<String> states = USStates.states; // List of state names
List<String> abbreviations = USStates.abbreviations; // List of state abbreviations
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

#### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Customizing State Display

You can customize how states are displayed in your app. For example, if you want to show states in a dropdown, you can use a `DropdownButton` widget:

```dart
DropdownButton<String>(
  items: USStates.states.map((String state) {
    return DropdownMenuItem<String>(
      value: state,
      child: Text(state),
    );
  }).toList(),
  onChanged: (String? newValue) {
    // Handle state selection
  },
)
```

With these steps, you can effectively integrate the `us_states` package into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using the `us_states` Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:us_states/us_states.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'US States Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Select Your State'),
        ),
        body: StateSelectionWidget(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class StateSelectionWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _StateSelectionWidgetState createState() => _StateSelectionWidgetState();
}

class _StateSelectionWidgetState extends State<StateSelectionWidget> {
  String? selectedState; // Variable to hold the selected state

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(
      child: DropdownButton<String>(
        hint: Text('Select a state'), // Hint text for the dropdown
        value: selectedState, // Current selected state
        items: USStates.states.map((String state) {
          return DropdownMenuItem<String>(
            value: state, // Value of the dropdown item
            child: Text(state), // Display text for the dropdown item
          );
        }).toList(),
        onChanged: (String? newValue) {
          setState(() {
            selectedState = newValue; // Update the selected state
          });
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold containing an AppBar and the StateSelectionWidget.
// 3. StateSelectionWidget is a StatefulWidget that manages the state of the selected state.
// 4. The build method of _StateSelectionWidgetState creates a DropdownButton populated with the list of states from the USStates package.
// 5. When a user selects a state, the onChanged callback updates the selectedState variable and rebuilds the widget to reflect the new selection.
```
