# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Social Share Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **social_share** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  social_share: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following permissions to allow sharing:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to share images.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to save images to your photo library.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to share text and images.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:social_share/social_share.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Social Share Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Share text
                  SocialShare.shareOptions("Check out this awesome app!");
                },
                child: Text('Share Text'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Share an image
                  SocialShare.shareImage("path/to/image.png");
                },
                child: Text('Share Image'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app with two buttons: one for sharing text and another for sharing an image. The `shareOptions` method is used to share text, while `shareImage` is used for sharing images.

# Complete Example of Social Share in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:social_share/social_share.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Social Share Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Share text using the social_share package
                  SocialShare.shareOptions("Check out this awesome app!");
                },
                child: Text('Share Text'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Share an image using the social_share package
                  SocialShare.shareImage("path/to/image.png");
                },
                child: Text('Share Image'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  // Run the RealFlutter app
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange two ElevatedButtons vertically.
// 4. The first button, when pressed, triggers the shareOptions method to share a text message.
// 5. The second button, when pressed, triggers the shareImage method to share an image from the specified path.
// 6. The app provides a simple interface for users to share content easily, enhancing user engagement and app visibility.
```
