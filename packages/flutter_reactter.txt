In summary, the code flows as follows:

*   The user interacts with the app by pressing the floating action button.
*   The button press triggers an action on the store, which updates its state.
*   The store notifies its listeners of the state change.
*   The widgets that depend on the store's state rebuild themselves with the new state.
*   The new state is displayed on the screen.

This flow is the core of the `flutter_reactter` package, and it provides a simple and intuitive way to manage state and side effects in Flutter applications.
