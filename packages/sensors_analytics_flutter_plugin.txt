# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Sensors Analytics Flutter Plugin

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `sensors_analytics_flutter_plugin` and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `sensors_analytics_flutter_plugin` to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  sensors_analytics_flutter_plugin: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/sensors_analytics_flutter_plugin).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. Ensure you have the correct deployment target set in `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Initializing the Plugin

In your main Dart file, import the package and initialize it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sensors_analytics_flutter_plugin/sensors_analytics_flutter_plugin.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
  // Initialize Sensors Analytics
  SensorsAnalyticsFlutterPlugin.startWithAppKey("YOUR_APP_KEY");
}
```

Replace `"YOUR_APP_KEY"` with your actual Sensors Analytics app key.

## Step 4: Using the Plugin

You can now use the plugin to track events and user profiles. Hereâ€™s how to log an event:

```dart
SensorsAnalyticsFlutterPlugin.track("Event Name", {
  "property1": "value1",
  "property2": "value2",
});
```

You can also set user profiles:

```dart
SensorsAnalyticsFlutterPlugin.setUserId("user_id");
SensorsAnalyticsFlutterPlugin.setUserProperties({
  "gender": "male",
  "age": 30,
});
```

With these steps, you are now ready to track user interactions and gather analytics data in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using the Sensors Analytics Flutter Plugin

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sensors_analytics_flutter_plugin/sensors_analytics_flutter_plugin.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
  // Initialize Sensors Analytics with your app key
  SensorsAnalyticsFlutterPlugin.startWithAppKey("YOUR_APP_KEY");
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sensors Analytics Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Sensors Analytics Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Track a button click event
            SensorsAnalyticsFlutterPlugin.track("Button Clicked", {
              "button_name": "Example Button",
              "timestamp": DateTime.now().toString(),
            });
            // Show a snackbar to confirm the event was tracked
            ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
              SnackBar(content: Text('Event Tracked!')),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Track Event'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and initializes the Sensors Analytics plugin with the provided app key.
// 2. The main widget is a MaterialApp that contains a HomeScreen.
// 3. The HomeScreen displays a button.
// 4. When the button is pressed, an event is tracked using the Sensors Analytics plugin.
// 5. A snackbar is shown to confirm that the event has been tracked successfully.
