# Flutter Quick Router: A Comprehensive Guide

The `flutter_quick_router` package is a powerful routing solution for Flutter applications, designed to simplify navigation and enhance the overall user experience. It provides a straightforward API for defining routes and managing navigation, making it an excellent choice for developers looking to streamline their routing logic.

## When to Use `flutter_quick_router`

You should consider using `flutter_quick_router` in scenarios such as:

- **Complex Navigation Flows**: When your application has multiple screens and complex navigation requirements, this package helps manage routes efficiently.
- **Dynamic Routing**: If your app requires dynamic route generation based on user input or other conditions, `flutter_quick_router` can handle this seamlessly.
- **Deep Linking**: For applications that need to support deep linking, this package simplifies the process of linking to specific screens within your app.

## Key Features

- **Simple API**: The package offers an intuitive API for defining routes and navigating between them.
- **Named Routes**: Easily define and use named routes for better readability and maintainability.
- **Middleware Support**: Implement middleware functions to handle authentication, logging, or other pre-navigation tasks.
- **Custom Route Transitions**: Customize the transition animations between routes to enhance the user experience.

With these features, `flutter_quick_router` stands out as a robust solution for managing navigation in Flutter applications.

# Setting Up and Using Flutter Quick Router

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_quick_router` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_quick_router` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_quick_router: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Basic Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions and configurations. Typically, no additional configurations are required for routing, but ensure your app's theme and other settings are correctly defined.

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` file to handle deep linking if your app supports it. Add the following entry to enable URL schemes:

```xml
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
  <dict>
    <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
    <array>
      <string>yourapp</string> <!-- Replace with your app's URL scheme -->
    </array>
  </dict>
</array>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

### Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_quick_router/flutter_quick_router.dart';
```

### Defining Routes

You can define your routes in a centralized location, typically in your main application file:

```dart
final router = QuickRouter(
  routes: {
    '/': (context) => HomeScreen(),
    '/details': (context) => DetailsScreen(),
  },
);
```

### Navigating Between Screens

To navigate between screens, use the `navigateTo` method provided by the router:

```dart
router.navigateTo(context, '/details');
```

### Middleware Example

You can also implement middleware for route protection:

```dart
router.addMiddleware((route) {
  if (!isUserLoggedIn) {
    return '/login'; // Redirect to login if not authenticated
  }
});
```

With these steps, you can effectively set up and use the `flutter_quick_router` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Flutter Quick Router

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_quick_router/flutter_quick_router.dart';

// Main entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// Main application widget
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Define the router with routes
    final router = QuickRouter(
      routes: {
        '/': (context) => HomeScreen(),
        '/details': (context) => DetailsScreen(),
      },
    );

    // Return the MaterialApp with the router
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Quick Router Example',
      home: router,
    );
  }
}

// Home screen widget
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate to the details screen
            QuickRouter.of(context).navigateTo(context, '/details');
          },
          child: Text('Go to Details'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Details screen widget
class DetailsScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Details')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('This is the details screen.'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application flow explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp().
// 2. MyApp is the root widget that initializes the QuickRouter with defined routes.
// 3. The home route (HomeScreen) is displayed first.
// 4. When the user taps the button on the HomeScreen, it triggers navigation to the DetailsScreen.
// 5. The DetailsScreen is displayed, showing its content.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application using the `flutter_quick_router` package. The application consists of two screens: a home screen and a details screen. The user can navigate from the home screen to the details screen by pressing a button.

### Summary of Application Flow

- The application starts with the `main()` function, which initializes the `MyApp` widget.
- The `MyApp` widget sets up the `QuickRouter` with defined routes for the home and details screens.
- The home screen is displayed first, featuring a button that, when pressed, navigates to the details screen.
- The details screen is then displayed, showcasing its content.

This structure and flow demonstrate how to effectively use the `flutter_quick_router` package to manage navigation in a Flutter application.
