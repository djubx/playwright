# Camera Process Flutter Package

The `camera_process` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to simplify the integration of camera functionalities into Flutter applications. It provides a comprehensive set of features that allow developers to capture images, record videos, and process camera feeds with ease. This package is particularly useful for applications that require real-time image processing, such as augmented reality, barcode scanning, or any app that needs to leverage the device's camera capabilities.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `camera_process` package in scenarios such as:
- Building a photo or video capturing app.
- Implementing augmented reality features.
- Creating a barcode or QR code scanner.
- Developing applications that require real-time image analysis.

## Key Features
- **Image Capture**: Easily capture images with customizable settings.
- **Video Recording**: Record videos with options for resolution and quality.
- **Real-time Processing**: Process camera feeds in real-time for applications like face detection or object tracking.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices.
- **Customizable UI**: Provides options to customize the camera interface to fit your app's design.

With these features, the `camera_process` package stands out as a versatile solution for developers looking to enhance their applications with camera functionalities.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Camera Process Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `camera_process` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `camera_process` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  camera_process: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version required
    }
}
```

2. Add camera permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys for camera usage:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to take photos.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone to record videos.</string>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple application that captures an image when a button is pressed.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:camera_process/camera_process.dart';
```

2. Initialize the camera and set up the UI to capture images.

This tutorial will guide you through the complete implementation in the next section.

# Complete Example: Camera Process in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:camera_process/camera_process.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  CameraController? _controller; // Controller for managing camera
  Future<void>? _initializeControllerFuture; // Future for initializing the controller

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the camera controller
    _initializeCamera();
  }

  Future<void> _initializeCamera() async {
    // Get the available cameras
    final cameras = await availableCameras();
    // Select the first camera
    final camera = cameras.first;

    // Initialize the camera controller
    _controller = CameraController(
      camera,
      ResolutionPreset.high, // Set the resolution
    );

    // Initialize the controller and store the future
    _initializeControllerFuture = _controller!.initialize();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the controller when the widget is disposed
    _controller?.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Camera Process Example')),
        body: FutureBuilder<void>(
          future: _initializeControllerFuture, // Wait for the camera to initialize
          builder: (context, snapshot) {
            if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.done) {
              // If the camera is initialized, display the camera preview
              return CameraPreview(_controller!);
            } else {
              // Otherwise, show a loading indicator
              return Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
            }
          },
        ),
        floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
          onPressed: () async {
            try {
              // Ensure the camera is initialized
              await _initializeControllerFuture;
              // Capture an image
              final image = await _controller!.takePicture();
              // Display the captured image
              showDialog(
                context: context,
                builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                  title: Text('Captured Image'),
                  content: Image.file(File(image.path)), // Display the image
                  actions: [
                    TextButton(
                      onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                      child: Text('OK'),
                    ),
                  ],
                ),
              );
            } catch (e) {
              // Handle any errors
              print(e);
            }
          },
          child: Icon(Icons.camera),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
// The application starts by running the RealFlutter widget.
// In the initState method, we initialize the camera controller.
// The _initializeCamera method fetches the available cameras and initializes the controller with the first camera.
// The build method uses a FutureBuilder to wait for the camera to initialize.
// Once initialized, it displays the camera preview.
// The floating action button captures an image when pressed and displays it in a dialog.
```
<!-- END_MAIN -->
```

### Summary of Application Flow
- The application starts by running the `RealFlutter` widget.
- In the `initState` method, the camera controller is initialized.
- The `_initializeCamera` method fetches the available cameras and initializes the controller with the first camera.
- The `build` method uses a `FutureBuilder` to wait for the camera to initialize. Once initialized, it displays the camera preview.
- The floating action button captures an image when pressed and displays it in a dialog.

This example demonstrates how to set up and use the `camera_process` package effectively in a Flutter application, showcasing its core functionalities.
