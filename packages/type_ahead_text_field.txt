# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `type_ahead_text_field`

## Installation
To get started with the `type_ahead_text_field` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  type_ahead_text_field: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/type_ahead_text_field).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `type_ahead_text_field`, you can create a simple widget that utilizes the package. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:type_ahead_text_field/type_ahead_text_field.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Type Ahead Text Field Example')),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: TypeAheadTextField(
            suggestionsCallback: (pattern) async {
              // Fetch suggestions based on the input pattern
              return await fetchSuggestions(pattern);
            },
            itemBuilder: (context, suggestion) {
              return ListTile(
                title: Text(suggestion),
              );
            },
            onSuggestionSelected: (suggestion) {
              // Handle the selection of a suggestion
              print('Selected: $suggestion');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  Future<List<String>> fetchSuggestions(String query) async {
    // Simulate a network call or database query
    await Future.delayed(Duration(milliseconds: 500));
    return ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry', 'Date', 'Elderberry']
        .where((fruit) => fruit.toLowerCase().contains(query.toLowerCase()))
        .toList();
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to set up a basic type-ahead text field that fetches suggestions based on user input. The `suggestionsCallback` function simulates fetching data, while the `itemBuilder` defines how each suggestion is displayed.

# Complete Example of `type_ahead_text_field`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:type_ahead_text_field/type_ahead_text_field.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Type Ahead Text Field Example')),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: TypeAheadTextField(
            suggestionsCallback: (pattern) async {
              // Fetch suggestions based on the input pattern
              return await fetchSuggestions(pattern);
            },
            itemBuilder: (context, suggestion) {
              // Build the suggestion item
              return ListTile(
                title: Text(suggestion),
              );
            },
            onSuggestionSelected: (suggestion) {
              // Handle the selection of a suggestion
              print('Selected: $suggestion');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  Future<List<String>> fetchSuggestions(String query) async {
    // Simulate a network call or database query
    await Future.delayed(Duration(milliseconds: 500));
    return ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry', 'Date', 'Elderberry']
        .where((fruit) => fruit.toLowerCase().contains(query.toLowerCase()))
        .toList();
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the `RealFlutter` widget, which builds a MaterialApp.
// 2. Inside the app, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a body containing a TypeAheadTextField.
// 3. The TypeAheadTextField listens for user input and calls the `suggestionsCallback` function.
// 4. The `fetchSuggestions` function simulates a delay and returns a filtered list of fruits based on the user's input.
// 5. The `itemBuilder` creates a ListTile for each suggestion, displaying the suggestion text.
// 6. When a suggestion is selected, the `onSuggestionSelected` callback is triggered, printing the selected suggestion to the console.
