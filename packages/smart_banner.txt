# Tutorial: Setting Up the Smart Banner Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the **smart_banner** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  smart_banner: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Ensure you have the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to allow network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Import the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:smart_banner/smart_banner.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Smart Banner
You can now use the `SmartBanner` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
SmartBanner(
  title: 'New Feature Available!',
  description: 'Check out our latest updates.',
  buttonText: 'Learn More',
  onPressed: () {
    // Action when the button is pressed
  },
);
```

This will display a banner at the top of your app, prompting users to engage with the new feature.

# Complete Example of Smart Banner in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:smart_banner/smart_banner.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Smart Banner Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Smart Banner Demo'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Display the Smart Banner at the top of the screen
          SmartBanner(
            title: 'New Feature Available!',
            description: 'Check out our latest updates.',
            buttonText: 'Learn More',
            onPressed: () {
              // Action when the button is pressed
              showDialog(
                context: context,
                builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                  title: Text('Feature Details'),
                  content: Text('Here are the details of the new feature.'),
                  actions: [
                    TextButton(
                      onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                      child: Text('Close'),
                    ),
                  ],
                ),
              );
            },
          ),
          // Main content of the app
          Expanded(
            child: Center(
              child: Text('Welcome to the Smart Banner Demo!'),
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The SmartBanner widget is placed at the top of the body, displaying a title, description, and a button.
// 5. When the button is pressed, an AlertDialog is shown with details about the new feature.
// 6. Below the banner, the main content of the app is displayed, welcoming users to the demo.
```

// Final Summary:
// The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` widget. This widget sets up a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen. The `HomeScreen` widget contains a `SmartBanner` at the top, which prompts users about a new feature. When users click the button on the banner, an AlertDialog appears, providing more information. Below the banner, a welcome message is displayed, creating a simple yet effective user interface that showcases the smart banner functionality.
