# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Parallax Rain Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **parallax_rain** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  parallax_rain: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file if your app requires internet access or other features. However, for basic usage of the **parallax_rain** package, no specific configurations are required.

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the **parallax_rain** package in your app.

# Complete Example of Using the Parallax Rain Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:parallax_rain/parallax_rain.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Parallax Rain Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        body: ParallaxRainWidget(
          // Setting the number of rain drops
          numberOfDrops: 100,
          // Setting the speed of the rain
          speed: 5.0,
          // Setting the direction of the rain
          direction: Direction.down,
          // Background color
          background: Colors.blue[800],
          // Customizing the rain drop color
          dropColor: Colors.white,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. Inside the MaterialApp, we define a Scaffold widget that serves as the basic structure of the app.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains the ParallaxRainWidget, which is responsible for rendering the rain effect.
// 5. We customize the rain effect by setting the number of drops, speed, direction, background color, and drop color.
// 6. The app will display a beautiful parallax rain effect on a blue background, creating an immersive experience for the user.
```
