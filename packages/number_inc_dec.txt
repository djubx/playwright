# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Number Inc Dec

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **number_inc_dec** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  number_inc_dec: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:number_inc_dec/number_inc_dec.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Widget

You can now use the `NumberIncDec` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s how to implement it in a simple Flutter app.

### Platform-Specific Details

- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21.
  
  ```gradle
  android {
      ...
      defaultConfig {
          ...
          minSdkVersion 21
      }
  }
  ```

- **iOS**: Make sure your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`.

  ```ruby
  platform :ios, '10.0'
  ```

## Step 4: Customization

The `NumberIncDec` widget allows for customization of its appearance and behavior. You can set the initial value, step size, and more.

```dart
NumberIncDec(
  initialValue: 1,
  minValue: 0,
  maxValue: 100,
  step: 1,
  onChanged: (value) {
    print("Current Value: $value");
  },
)
```

This setup will create a number increment and decrement widget that starts at 1, allows values between 0 and 100, and increments or decrements by 1.

# Complete Example of Number Inc Dec

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:number_inc_dec/number_inc_dec.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Number Inc Dec Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Number Increment Decrement'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: NumberControl(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class NumberControl extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _NumberControlState createState() => _NumberControlState();
}

class _NumberControlState extends State<NumberControl> {
  // Variable to hold the current value
  int _currentValue = 1;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        // Display the current value
        Text(
          'Current Value: $_currentValue',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20),
        // Number increment and decrement widget
        NumberIncDec(
          initialValue: _currentValue,
          minValue: 0,
          maxValue: 100,
          step: 1,
          onChanged: (value) {
            // Update the current value when changed
            setState(() {
              _currentValue = value;
            });
          },
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a centered NumberControl widget.
// 4. NumberControl is a StatefulWidget that maintains the current value.
// 5. The current value is displayed in a Text widget.
// 6. The NumberIncDec widget is used to allow users to increment or decrement the value.
// 7. When the value changes, the onChanged callback updates the _currentValue state.
// 8. The UI rebuilds to reflect the new current value.
```
