# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Number to Words Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the `number_to_words` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  number_to_words: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:number_to_words/number_to_words.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package
You can now use the `NumberToWords` class to convert numbers to words. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
void main() {
  int number = 123;
  String words = NumberToWords.convert(number);
  print(words); // Output: One Hundred Twenty-Three
}
```

This basic setup allows you to convert numbers to words easily. You can explore more features and customization options in the package documentation.

# Complete Example of Using the Number to Words Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:number_to_words/number_to_words.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Number to Words Example',
      home: NumberToWordsHome(),
    );
  }
}

class NumberToWordsHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _NumberToWordsHomeState createState() => _NumberToWordsHomeState();
}

class _NumberToWordsHomeState extends State<NumberToWordsHome> {
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController();
  String _result = '';

  // Function to convert the input number to words
  void _convertNumber() {
    // Parse the input from the text field
    int number = int.tryParse(_controller.text) ?? 0;
    // Convert the number to words
    _result = NumberToWords.convert(number);
    // Update the UI
    setState(() {});
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Number to Words Converter'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              controller: _controller,
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Enter a number',
              ),
              keyboardType: TextInputType.number,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _convertNumber,
              child: Text('Convert to Words'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(
              'In Words: $_result',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home screen as NumberToWordsHome.
// 3. NumberToWordsHome is a stateful widget that maintains the state of the input and result.
// 4. The user enters a number in the TextField, which is controlled by _controller.
// 5. When the user presses the "Convert to Words" button, the _convertNumber function is called.
// 6. This function parses the input number, converts it to words using NumberToWords.convert, and updates the _result.
// 7. The UI is updated to display the converted words.
