# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Super Rich Text Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **super_rich_text** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  super_rich_text: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the **super_rich_text** widget.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:super_rich_text/super_rich_text.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Super Rich Text Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: SuperRichText(
            text: 'Welcome to Flutter! Visit our website at [Flutter](https://flutter.dev)',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            linkStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.blue, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
            onLinkTap: (url) {
              // Handle link tap
              print('Link tapped: $url');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays a rich text message with a clickable link.

# Complete Example of Super Rich Text

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:super_rich_text/super_rich_text.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Super Rich Text Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: SuperRichText(
            text: 'Welcome to Flutter! Visit our website at [Flutter](https://flutter.dev)',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20), // Set the default text style
            linkStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.blue, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold), // Style for links
            onLinkTap: (url) {
              // Handle link tap
              print('Link tapped: $url'); // Print the URL to the console
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the UI.
// 3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// 4. The AppBar displays the title of the application.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains a SuperRichText widget.
// 6. The SuperRichText widget displays a welcome message with a clickable link.
// 7. When the link is tapped, the onLinkTap callback is triggered, printing the URL to the console.
