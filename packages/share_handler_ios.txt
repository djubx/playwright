<string>This app requires access to your microphone for audio sharing.</string>
```

### Step 3: Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### Step 4: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:share_handler_ios/share_handler_ios.dart';
```

## Using the Package

### Basic Usage Example

Hereâ€™s how to use the `share_handler_ios` package to share text and images:

```dart
void shareText(String text) {
  ShareHandler.shareText(text);
}

void shareImage(String imagePath) {
  ShareHandler.shareImage(imagePath);
}
```

### Example of Sharing Content

You can create a button in your Flutter app that triggers the sharing functionality:

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () {
    shareText("Check out this amazing content!");
  },
  child: Text("Share Text"),
),
```

This button will share the specified text when pressed.

By following these steps, you can easily integrate the `share_handler_ios` package into your Flutter application and enable content sharing functionality.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:share_handler_ios/share_handler_ios.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Share Handler Example',
      home: ShareHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class ShareHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Share Handler Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Share text when the button is pressed
                shareText("Check out this amazing content!");
              },
              child: Text("Share Text"),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Share an image when the button is pressed
                shareImage("path/to/your/image.png");
              },
              child: Text("Share Image"),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to share text
  void shareText(String text) {
    // Call the shareText method from the share_handler_ios package
    ShareHandler.shareText(text);
  }

  // Function to share an image
  void shareImage(String imagePath) {
    // Call the shareImage method from the share_handler_ios package
    ShareHandler.shareImage(imagePath);
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home page.
// 3. The ShareHomePage widget is displayed, containing two buttons for sharing text and images.
// 4. When the "Share Text" button is pressed, the shareText function is called, which uses the ShareHandler to share the specified text.
// 5. When the "Share Image" button is pressed, the shareImage function is called, which uses the ShareHandler to share the specified image.
// 6. The user can share content seamlessly with just a tap on the buttons.
