<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Extension Discovery Flutter Package

The `extension_discovery` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that simplifies the process of discovering and using extensions in your applications. This package allows you to dynamically load and utilize extensions, making it easier to enhance your app's functionality without hardcoding dependencies.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the `extension_discovery` package in scenarios such as:

- **Plugin Development**: When creating plugins that require dynamic loading of features based on user preferences or configurations.
- **Modular Applications**: In applications where different modules or features can be added or removed at runtime, allowing for a more flexible architecture.
- **Feature Flags**: When implementing feature flags that enable or disable certain functionalities based on user roles or settings.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Extension Loading**: Load extensions at runtime based on user actions or configurations.
- **Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that integrates well with existing Flutter applications.

By leveraging the `extension_discovery` package, developers can create more modular and maintainable applications, enhancing the overall user experience.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Extension Discovery Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `extension_discovery` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  extension_discovery: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/extension_discovery).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Ensure you have the necessary permissions and configurations. For example, if your extensions require internet access, add:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add any required permissions or configurations. For example, if your extensions need to access the network, include:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to discover and use extensions:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:extension_discovery/extension_discovery.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Extension Discovery Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Discover available extensions
              final extensions = await ExtensionDiscovery.discoverExtensions();
              // Use the discovered extensions
              for (var extension in extensions) {
                print('Discovered extension: ${extension.name}');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Discover Extensions'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that discovers available extensions when a button is pressed.

# Complete Example of Using the Extension Discovery Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:extension_discovery/extension_discovery.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Extension Discovery Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Discover available extensions
              final extensions = await ExtensionDiscovery.discoverExtensions();
              // Use the discovered extensions
              for (var extension in extensions) {
                print('Discovered extension: ${extension.name}');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Discover Extensions'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The MaterialApp widget is created, providing the basic structure of the app.
// 3. A Scaffold widget is used to create the app's visual layout, including an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the onPressed callback is triggered.
// 6. The app calls the discoverExtensions method from the ExtensionDiscovery class to find available extensions.
// 7. Once the extensions are discovered, the app iterates through them and prints their names to the console.
// 8. This allows developers to see which extensions are available for use in their application.
```
