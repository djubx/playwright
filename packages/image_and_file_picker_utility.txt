# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using image_and_file_picker_utility

## Installation
To use the `image_and_file_picker_utility` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  image_and_file_picker_utility: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/image_and_file_picker_utility).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
```

2. If targeting Android 10 (API level 29) or higher, you may need to add the following attribute to your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<application
    android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="true"
    ... >
```

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request permission for accessing the photo library and camera:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to upload images.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to take pictures.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the package, you can create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class and call its methods to pick images or files. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:image_and_file_picker_utility/image_and_file_picker_utility.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Image and File Picker Utility')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Call the method to pick an image
              final image = await ImageAndFilePickerUtility.pickImage();
              // Handle the selected image
              if (image != null) {
                // Do something with the image
              }
            },
            child: Text('Pick an Image'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a simple Flutter app with a button that allows users to pick an image from their device.

                        actions: [
                          TextButton(
                            onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                            child: Text('Close'),
                          ),
                        ],
                      ),
                    );
                  }
                },
                child: Text('Pick a File'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, there are two ElevatedButtons:
//    - The first button allows users to pick an image. When pressed, it calls the pickImage method from the ImageAndFilePickerUtility.
//    - If an image is selected, it displays the image in a dialog.
//    - The second button allows users to pick a file. When pressed, it calls the pickFile method.
//    - If a file is selected, it displays the file path in a dialog.
// 4. The dialogs provide a way to view the selected image or file and can be closed by the user.
