# Tutorial: Setting Up the Zoom Native SDK in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `zoom_native_sdk` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the `zoom_native_sdk` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  zoom_native_sdk: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Add the necessary permissions and metadata in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.yourapp">

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
    
    <application>
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.zipow.videobox.sdk.ZOOM_SDK_KEY"
            android:value="YOUR_ZOOM_SDK_KEY"/>
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.zipow.videobox.sdk.ZOOM_SDK_SECRET"
            android:value="YOUR_ZOOM_SDK_SECRET"/>
    </application>
</manifest>
```

2. **Replace `YOUR_ZOOM_SDK_KEY` and `YOUR_ZOOM_SDK_SECRET`** with your actual Zoom SDK credentials.

### iOS Configuration
1. **Update Info.plist**: Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera for video calls.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio calls.</string>
```

2. **Add SDK Key and Secret**: You can also add your Zoom SDK credentials in the `AppDelegate.swift` file:

```swift
import UIKit
import Flutter
import MobileRTC

@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: FlutterAppDelegate {
    override func application(
        _ application: UIApplication,
        didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?
    ) -> Bool {
        MobileRTC.shared().initializeWithDomain("zoom.us", appKey: "YOUR_ZOOM_SDK_KEY", appSecret: "YOUR_ZOOM_SDK_SECRET")
        GeneratedPluginRegistrant.register(with: self)
        return true
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Initialize the SDK
In your main Dart file, initialize the Zoom SDK before using any of its features. 

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:zoom_native_sdk/zoom_native_sdk.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Zoom Native SDK Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Using the SDK
You can now use the SDK to join or start meetings. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to start a meeting.

```dart
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Zoom Native SDK Demo')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () async {
            // Start a meeting
            await ZoomNativeSdk.startMeeting(
              meetingId: 'YOUR_MEETING_ID',
              meetingPassword: 'YOUR_MEETING_PASSWORD',
            );
          },
          child: Text('Start Meeting'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This button will start a Zoom meeting when pressed. Make sure to replace `YOUR_MEETING_ID` and `YOUR_MEETING_PASSWORD` with actual values.

# Complete Example: Zoom Native SDK in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:zoom_native_sdk/zoom_native_sdk.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Zoom Native SDK Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Zoom Native SDK Demo')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () async {
            // Start a meeting with specified ID and password
            await ZoomNativeSdk.startMeeting(
              meetingId: 'YOUR_MEETING_ID', // Replace with your meeting ID
              meetingPassword: 'YOUR_MEETING_PASSWORD', // Replace with your meeting password
            );
          },
          child: Text('Start Meeting'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the MyApp class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The HomeScreen widget is displayed as the home screen of the app.
// 3. The HomeScreen contains a button labeled "Start Meeting."
// 4. When the button is pressed, the onPressed callback is triggered.
// 5. Inside the callback, the ZoomNativeSdk.startMeeting method is called with the meeting ID and password.
// 6. This initiates the Zoom meeting, allowing the user to join the specified meeting.
```
