Setting Up the Package
----------------------

To use the `phlox_animations` package in your Flutter app, follow these steps:

1. Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  phlox_animations: ^1.0.0
```
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.
3. Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:phlox_animations/phlox_animations.dart';
```
Using the Package
-----------------

To use the package, you can create an instance of the `PhloxAnimations` class and call one of its animation methods. For example:
```dart
PhloxAnimations _animations = PhloxAnimations();

// Create a button with an animation
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () {
    _animations.animateButton(
      context: context,
      child: Text('Click me!'),
      animationType: AnimationType.scale,
    );
  },
  child: Text('Click me!'),
)
```
Platform-Specific Details
-------------------------

The `phlox_animations` package supports both Android and iOS platforms. However, some animations may not work as expected on certain platforms due to differences in the underlying animation APIs.

To optimize the package for a specific platform, you can use the `PhloxAnimations` class's `platform` property. For example:
```dart
PhloxAnimations _animations = PhloxAnimations(platform: Platform.android);
```

                  animationType: AnimationType.scale,
                );
              },
              child: Text('Click me!'),
            ),
            // Create a card with an animation
            Card(
              child: ListTile(
                title: Text('Card title'),
                subtitle: Text('Card subtitle'),
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application flow:
// 1. The user clicks the button.
// 2. The button animation is triggered.
// 3. The card animation is triggered.
// 4. The user sees the animated button and card.
```

// The application flow is as follows:
// The user clicks the button, which triggers the button animation.
// The button animation is handled by the PhloxAnimations class.
// The card animation is also triggered, and the user sees the animated button and card.
// The application uses the PhloxAnimations class to handle all animations.
