## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

## Usage
To use the icons in your Flutter application, you can import the package and use the icons as follows:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:remix_icon_icons/remix_icon_icons.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Remix Icons Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Icon(
            RemixIcon.home_2_line, // Using a Remix icon
            size: 50.0,
            color: Colors.blue,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to display a simple Remix icon in the center of the screen. You can replace `RemixIcon.home_2_line` with any other icon from the package.

              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between icons
              Icon(
                RemixIcon.user_3_line, // User icon
                size: 50.0,
                color: Colors.green,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between icons

                size: 50.0,
                color: Colors.red,
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Entry point of the application
}

// The application starts by running the RealFlutter widget.
// The MaterialApp widget sets up the app's theme and navigation.
// The Scaffold widget provides a structure for the app, including an AppBar and a body.
// In the body, a Center widget is used to center the content.
// A Column widget is used to stack multiple icons vertically.
// Each Icon widget displays a different Remix icon with specified size and color.
// SizedBox is used to add space between the icons for better visual separation.
// Finally, the main function runs the RealFlutter widget, launching the app.
