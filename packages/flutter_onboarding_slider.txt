      ),
      home: RealFlutter(), // Set RealFlutter as the home widget
    );
  }
}

// RealFlutter class to display the onboarding slider
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  // Define the slides for the onboarding process
  final List<OnboardingSlide> slides = [
    OnboardingSlide(
      title: "Welcome",
      description: "Discover the amazing features of our app.",
      image: Image.asset('assets/welcome.png'),
    ),
    OnboardingSlide(
      title: "Stay Connected",
      description: "Stay connected with your friends and family.",
      image: Image.asset('assets/connect.png'),
    ),
    OnboardingSlide(
      title: "Get Started",
      description: "Let's get started with our app.",
      image: Image.asset('assets/start.png'),
    ),
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: OnboardingSlider(
        slides: slides, // Pass the slides to the OnboardingSlider
        onFinish: () {
          // Define what happens when the onboarding is finished
          Navigator.pushReplacement(
            context,
            MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => MainAppScreen()),
          );
        },
        background: Colors.white, // Set the background color
        skipTextButton: Text('Skip'), // Add a skip button
        nextTextButton: Text('Next'), // Add a next button
        finishTextButton: Text('Finish'), // Add a finish button
      ),
    );
  }
}

// MainAppScreen class to represent the main screen of the app
class MainAppScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Main App Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to the main app!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The application starts with the `MyApp` class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// The `RealFlutter` class is the home widget, displaying the onboarding slider.
// The onboarding slider is created using the `OnboardingSlider` widget, which takes a list of slides.
// Each slide is an instance of `OnboardingSlide`, containing a title, description, and image.
// The `onFinish` callback is triggered when the user completes the onboarding, navigating to the `MainAppScreen`.
// The `MainAppScreen` is a simple screen with a welcome message, representing the main content of the app.
