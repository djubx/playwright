# Navigation Utils Flutter Package

The `navigation_utils` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to simplify navigation within Flutter applications. It provides a set of utilities that enhance the navigation experience, making it easier to manage routes, transitions, and deep linking. This package is particularly useful in complex applications where managing multiple screens and their transitions can become cumbersome.

## When to Use

You should consider using the `navigation_utils` package when:
- Your application has multiple screens and complex navigation flows.
- You need to implement deep linking to navigate to specific content within your app.
- You want to customize transitions between screens for a better user experience.
- You require a simple way to manage navigation state and history.

## Features

- **Route Management**: Easily define and manage routes in your application.
- **Custom Transitions**: Implement custom animations for screen transitions.
- **Deep Linking Support**: Handle deep links to navigate directly to specific screens.
- **Navigation History**: Maintain a history of navigation actions for better user experience.

By leveraging these features, developers can create a more intuitive and user-friendly navigation experience in their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Navigation Utils

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `navigation_utils` package and demonstrate how to use its features effectively.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `navigation_utils` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  navigation_utils: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions for deep linking. Add the following intent filter within the `<activity>` tag:

```xml
<intent-filter>
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
    <data android:scheme="yourapp" android:host="example.com" />
</intent-filter>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you need to configure your `Info.plist` to support deep linking. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
    <dict>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
        <array>
            <string>yourapp</string>
        </array>
    </dict>
</array>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating the key features of the `navigation_utils` package.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:navigation_utils/navigation_utils.dart'; // Import the package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the main application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Navigation Utils Demo',
      initialRoute: '/',
      routes: {
        '/': (context) => HomeScreen(), // Define the home screen route
        '/details': (context) => DetailsScreen(), // Define the details screen route
      },
    );
  }
}

// HomeScreen widget
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home Screen')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate to DetailsScreen with a custom transition
            NavigationUtils.navigateTo(
              context,
              '/details',
              transition: TransitionType.fade, // Custom transition
            );
          },
          child: Text('Go to Details'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// DetailsScreen widget
class DetailsScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Details Screen')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to the Details Screen!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with initial routes.
// 3. The HomeScreen is displayed first, with a button to navigate to the DetailsScreen.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the NavigationUtils.navigateTo method is called,
//    which handles the navigation with a fade transition.
// 5. The DetailsScreen is displayed, showing a simple message.
```
