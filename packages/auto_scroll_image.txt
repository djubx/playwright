# Auto Scroll Image Flutter Package

The `auto_scroll_image` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to create dynamic and engaging image galleries. This package allows images to automatically scroll horizontally or vertically, providing a seamless viewing experience for users. It is particularly useful for applications that require showcasing multiple images, such as photo galleries, product showcases, or social media feeds.

## When to Use This Package
- **Image Galleries**: When you want to display a series of images that users can view without manual scrolling.
- **Product Showcases**: Ideal for e-commerce applications where multiple product images need to be displayed.
- **Social Media Feeds**: Useful for apps that aggregate images from various sources.

## Features
- **Automatic Scrolling**: Automatically scrolls through images at a configurable speed.
- **Customizable Scroll Direction**: Supports both horizontal and vertical scrolling.
- **Pause on Interaction**: Automatically pauses scrolling when the user interacts with the image.
- **Infinite Looping**: Allows for an infinite loop of images, creating a continuous viewing experience.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Auto Scroll Image Package

## Installation
To use the `auto_scroll_image` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  auto_scroll_image: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/auto_scroll_image).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package
To use the `auto_scroll_image` package, you can create a simple widget that utilizes the `AutoScrollImage` class. Below is a basic example of how to implement it.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:auto_scroll_image/auto_scroll_image.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Auto Scroll Image Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: AutoScrollImage(
          images: [
            'https://example.com/image1.jpg',
            'https://example.com/image2.jpg',
            'https://example.com/image3.jpg',
          ],
          scrollDirection: Axis.horizontal, // Set scroll direction
          autoScrollDuration: Duration(seconds: 3), // Duration for auto scroll
          pauseOnInteraction: true, // Pause on user interaction
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple app that displays three images that scroll horizontally every three seconds. The scrolling pauses when the user interacts with the images.

# Complete Example of Auto Scroll Image

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:auto_scroll_image/auto_scroll_image.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Auto Scroll Image Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Auto Scroll Image Example'), // Title of the app
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: AutoScrollImage(
          images: [
            'https://example.com/image1.jpg', // First image URL
            'https://example.com/image2.jpg', // Second image URL
            'https://example.com/image3.jpg', // Third image URL
          ],
          scrollDirection: Axis.horizontal, // Set scroll direction to horizontal
          autoScrollDuration: Duration(seconds: 3), // Set auto scroll duration
          pauseOnInteraction: true, // Enable pause on user interaction
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to RealFlutter, which is the main widget.
// 4. RealFlutter creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, AutoScrollImage is instantiated with a list of image URLs.
// 6. The images will scroll horizontally every 3 seconds, and scrolling will pause if the user interacts with the images.
