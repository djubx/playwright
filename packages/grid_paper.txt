# Overview of the grid_paper Flutter Package

The `grid_paper` package is a Flutter widget that provides a customizable grid overlay for your application. This package is particularly useful for designers and developers who want to create a structured layout or need a visual reference for aligning UI elements. The grid can be displayed in various configurations, making it a versatile tool for both prototyping and production applications.

## When to Use `grid_paper`

- **Design Prototyping**: When you need to visualize the layout of your app and ensure elements are aligned properly.
- **Game Development**: For grid-based games where you need a clear visual representation of the game area.
- **Custom Layouts**: When building complex UIs that require precise alignment of widgets.

## Key Features

- **Customizable Grid Size**: You can define the size of the grid cells to fit your design needs.
- **Color and Opacity**: The grid lines can be customized in terms of color and opacity, allowing for better integration with your app's theme.
- **Snap to Grid**: Helps in aligning widgets to the grid, making it easier to create structured layouts.

# Setting Up and Using the grid_paper Package

## Installation

To use the `grid_paper` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  grid_paper: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Usage

### Basic Setup

To use the `grid_paper` widget, you can wrap it around your main widget. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:grid_paper/grid_paper.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: GridPaper(
          color: Colors.blue.withOpacity(0.5), // Set grid color
          divisions: 10, // Number of divisions in the grid
          interval: 50.0, // Size of each grid cell
          child: Center(
            child: Text('Hello, Grid!'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Platform-Specific Details

- **Android**: No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure you have the Flutter SDK set up correctly.
- **iOS**: Similarly, no specific configurations are needed for iOS. Ensure your iOS deployment target is compatible with the Flutter version you are using.

### Optimizations

- **Performance**: If you are using a complex UI, consider using the `GridPaper` widget only during the design phase and remove it in production to enhance performance.

# Complete Example of Using grid_paper

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:grid_paper/grid_paper.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Grid Paper Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Grid Paper Example'),
        ),
        body: GridPaper(
          color: Colors.green.withOpacity(0.3), // Set the grid color with some transparency
          divisions: 10, // Number of divisions in the grid
          interval: 50.0, // Size of each grid cell
          child: Center(
            child: Column(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              children: <Widget>[
                Text('Welcome to Grid Paper!'),
                SizedBox(height: 20), // Add space between widgets
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () {
                    // Action when button is pressed
                    print('Button Pressed!');
                  },
                  child: Text('Press Me'),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter as the root widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body is wrapped in a GridPaper widget, which provides a grid overlay.
// 5. The GridPaper is configured with a green color, 10 divisions, and a cell size of 50.0.
// 6. Inside the GridPaper, a Center widget is used to center the content.
// 7. A Column widget is used to stack the Text and ElevatedButton vertically.
// 8. When the button is pressed, a message is printed to the console.
