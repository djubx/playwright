// The `MyApp` widget is the root of the application and is responsible for rendering the `MyHomePage` widget.
// The `MyHomePage` widget is a stateless widget that renders a `Scaffold` widget with an `AppBar` and a `GridPaper` widget.
// The `GridPaper` widget is used to create a grid layout with 10x10 pixel grid cells and blue grid lines.
// A `Container` widget is used as the child of the `GridPaper` widget to display a red square inside the grid layout.
