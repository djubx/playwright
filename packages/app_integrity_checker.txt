# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the App Integrity Checker

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the app_integrity_checker package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the app_integrity_checker package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  app_integrity_checker: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/app_integrity_checker).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

3. Add the following to your `android/app/build.gradle` file to enable ProGuard:

```groovy
buildTypes {
    release {
        minifyEnabled true
        proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following key to allow network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the app_integrity_checker in your app.

# Complete Example of Using App Integrity Checker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:app_integrity_checker/app_integrity_checker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'App Integrity Checker Example',
      home: IntegrityCheckScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class IntegrityCheckScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _IntegrityCheckScreenState createState() => _IntegrityCheckScreenState();
}

class _IntegrityCheckScreenState extends State<IntegrityCheckScreen> {
  String _integrityStatus = 'Checking...';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _checkIntegrity();
  }

  // Method to check the app's integrity
  Future<void> _checkIntegrity() async {
    // Call the integrity checker
    final integrityResult = await AppIntegrityChecker.checkIntegrity();

    // Update the status based on the result
    setState(() {
      _integrityStatus = integrityResult ? 'Integrity Verified' : 'Integrity Compromised';
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Integrity Check'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          _integrityStatus,
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home screen.
// 3. The home screen is IntegrityCheckScreen, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 4. In the _IntegrityCheckScreenState, the initState method is overridden to call _checkIntegrity when the widget is first created.
// 5. The _checkIntegrity method uses the AppIntegrityChecker to check the app's integrity.
// 6. Based on the result, the integrity status is updated and displayed on the screen.
// 7. The UI shows either "Integrity Verified" or "Integrity Compromised" based on the integrity check result.
```
