# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the `html_main_element` Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `html_main_element` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  html_main_element: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you plan to load external HTML content. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to render HTML content.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:html_main_element/html_main_element.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample HTML content
    String htmlContent = """
      <h1>Hello, Flutter!</h1>
      <p>This is a <strong>simple</strong> example of rendering HTML.</p>
      <a href='https://flutter.dev'>Learn more about Flutter</a>
    """;

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('HTML Main Element Example'),
        ),
        body: HtmlMainElement(
          data: htmlContent, // Pass the HTML content here
          onLinkTap: (url) {
            // Handle link taps
            print('Link tapped: $url');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that renders HTML content. The `HtmlMainElement` widget takes the HTML string and displays it as formatted text. The `onLinkTap` callback allows you to handle link clicks, providing a way to navigate to external URLs.

# Complete Example of the `html_main_element` Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:html_main_element/html_main_element.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample HTML content
    String htmlContent = """
      <h1>Hello, Flutter!</h1>
      <p>This is a <strong>simple</strong> example of rendering HTML.</p>
      <a href='https://flutter.dev'>Learn more about Flutter</a>
    """;

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('HTML Main Element Example'),
        ),
        body: HtmlMainElement(
          data: htmlContent, // Pass the HTML content here
          onLinkTap: (url) {
            // Handle link taps
            print('Link tapped: $url');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the UI.
// 3. Inside the build method, we define a string containing HTML content.
// 4. We create a MaterialApp with a Scaffold that contains an AppBar and a body.
// 5. The body uses the HtmlMainElement widget to render the HTML content.
// 6. The onLinkTap callback is defined to handle link clicks, printing the URL to the console.
// 7. Finally, the runApp function is called to launch the application.
```
