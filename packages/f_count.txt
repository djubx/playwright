// 1. The user opens the app and is presented with a simple UI displaying the current count value.
// 2. The user can press the "Increment" button to increment the count by 1.
// 3. The user can press the "Decrement" button to decrement the count by 1.
// 4. The user can press the "Reset" button to reset the count to its initial value (0).
// 5. Each time the user interacts with the buttons, the UI is updated to reflect the new count value.
