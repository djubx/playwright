# f_count Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To add the `f_count` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  f_count: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your counting feature interacts with any device capabilities.

## Basic Usage
To use the `f_count` package, you can create a simple counter widget. Hereâ€™s how to implement it:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:
   ```dart
   import 'package:f_count/f_count.dart';
   ```

2. Create a stateful widget to manage the count:
   ```dart
   class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
     @override
     _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
   }

   class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
     int _count = 0;

     void _incrementCount() {
       setState(() {
         _count++;
       });
     }

     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return Scaffold(
         appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Counter Example')),
         body: Center(
           child: Column(
             mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
             children: <Widget>[
               Text('Count: $_count'),
               ElevatedButton(
                 onPressed: _incrementCount,
                 child: Text('Increment'),
               ),
             ],
           ),
         ),
       );
     }
   }
   ```

This code sets up a basic counter application using the `f_count` package. The count is displayed in the center of the screen, and pressing the button increments the count.

# Complete Example of f_count in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:f_count/f_count.dart'; // Importing the f_count package

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp()); // Running the main application
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'f_count Example',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: RealFlutter(), // Setting RealFlutter as the home widget
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  int _count = 0; // Initializing the count variable

  void _incrementCount() {
    setState(() {
      _count++; // Incrementing the count
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Counter Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Count: $_count'), // Displaying the current count
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _incrementCount, // Increment count on button press
              child: Text('Increment'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to RealFlutter.
// 4. RealFlutter is a stateful widget that maintains the count state.
// 5. The _incrementCount method updates the count and triggers a UI rebuild.
// 6. The UI displays the current count and an Increment button.
// 7. Pressing the button calls _incrementCount, increasing the count and updating the display.
