# Setting Up and Using the `survey_kit` Package

## Installation
To get started with the `survey_kit` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  survey_kit: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/survey_kit).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following permissions if you plan to collect sensitive data:
   ```xml
   <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your photo library to upload images.</string>
   <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your camera to take photos.</string>
   ```

## Basic Usage
Once you have installed the package and configured your project, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a survey using `survey_kit`.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:survey_kit/survey_kit.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Survey Kit Example',
      home: SurveyPage(),
    );
  }
}

class SurveyPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Survey')),
      body: Survey(
        onCompleted: (SurveyResult result) {
          // Handle the survey result
          print(result);
        },
        survey: Survey(
          title: 'User Feedback Survey',
          questions: [
            Question(
              type: QuestionType.multipleChoice,
              question: 'How satisfied are you with our service?',
              answerOptions: [
                'Very Satisfied',
                'Satisfied',
                'Neutral',
                'Dissatisfied',
                'Very Dissatisfied',
              ],
            ),
            Question(
              type: QuestionType.text,
              question: 'What can we improve?',
            ),
          ],
        ),

                'Very Dissatisfied',
              ],
            ),
            Question(
              type: QuestionType.text,
              question: 'What can we improve?',
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home page.
// 3. The SurveyPage widget is displayed as the home page, which contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Survey widget that takes an onCompleted callback and a Survey object.
// 5. The Survey object includes a title and a list of questions, each defined with its type and options.
// 6. When the survey is completed, the onCompleted callback is triggered, and the results are printed to the console.
