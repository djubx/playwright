# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `patrol_finders`

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `patrol_finders` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `patrol_finders` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  patrol_finders: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version
    }
}

dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-location:18.0.0' // Required for location services
}
```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request location permissions:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to track patrols.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to track patrols even when the app is in the background.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to initialize the package and track a patrol.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:patrol_finders/patrol_finders.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late PatrolFinder _patrolFinder;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _patrolFinder = PatrolFinder();
    _startTracking();
  }

  void _startTracking() async {
    // Start tracking the patrol
    await _patrolFinder.startTracking();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Patrol Finder')),
        body: Center(child: Text('Tracking Patrol...')),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize the `PatrolFinder` and start tracking the patrol in the `initState` method. The app displays a simple message indicating that tracking is in progress.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the `patrol_finders` package in your Flutter application effectively.

# Complete Example of `patrol_finders`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:patrol_finders/patrol_finders.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late PatrolFinder _patrolFinder; // Declare the PatrolFinder instance
  String _locationMessage = "Tracking Patrol..."; // Message to display the tracking status

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _patrolFinder = PatrolFinder(); // Initialize the PatrolFinder
    _startTracking(); // Start tracking the patrol
  }

  void _startTracking() async {
    // Start tracking the patrol
    await _patrolFinder.startTracking();
    // Listen for location updates
    _patrolFinder.onLocationChanged.listen((location) {
      setState(() {
        // Update the message with the current location
        _locationMessage = "Current Location: ${location.latitude}, ${location.longitude}";
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Patrol Finder')),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(_locationMessage), // Display the current location
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and the RealFlutter widget is created.
// 2. In the initState method, we initialize the PatrolFinder instance.
// 3. The _startTracking method is called to begin tracking the patrol's location.
// 4. We listen for location updates from the PatrolFinder.
// 5. Whenever a new location is received, we update the _locationMessage state variable.
// 6. The UI is rebuilt to display the current location of the patrol in real-time.
