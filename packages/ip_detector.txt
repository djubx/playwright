# Overview of the `ip_detector` Flutter Package

The `ip_detector` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to help developers easily retrieve and manage IP address information within their Flutter applications. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to identify the user's IP address for purposes such as geolocation, network diagnostics, or security checks.

## When to Use `ip_detector`

- **Geolocation Services**: Determine the user's location based on their IP address.
- **Network Diagnostics**: Monitor and log IP addresses for network troubleshooting.
- **Security Applications**: Implement IP-based access control or logging.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API for fetching IP addresses.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Provides real-time IP address updates.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal impact on app performance.

The `ip_detector` package simplifies the process of obtaining and using IP address information, making it an essential tool for developers who need to incorporate network-related features into their Flutter applications.

# Setting Up and Using the `ip_detector` Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up the `ip_detector` package in a Flutter project and demonstrate how to use it effectively.

## Setup Process

### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the `ip_detector` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ip_detector: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android

1. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions to access the internet:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

#### iOS

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to allow network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
  <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
  <true/>
</dict>
```

### Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the `ip_detector` package:

```dart
import 'package:ip_detector/ip_detector.dart';
```

## Using the Package

To use the `ip_detector` package, create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class and call its methods to fetch the IP address.

```dart
RealFlutter ipDetector = RealFlutter();
String ipAddress = await ipDetector.getIpAddress();
print('IP Address: $ipAddress');
```

This simple setup allows you to retrieve the user's IP address and use it within your application.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ip_detector/ip_detector.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'IP Detector Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: IpDetectorScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class IpDetectorScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _IpDetectorScreenState createState() => _IpDetectorScreenState();
}

class _IpDetectorScreenState extends State<IpDetectorScreen> {
  String _ipAddress = 'Fetching...';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _fetchIpAddress();
  }

  // Function to fetch the IP address using the RealFlutter class
  Future<void> _fetchIpAddress() async {
    RealFlutter ipDetector = RealFlutter(); // Create an instance of RealFlutter
    try {
      String ipAddress = await ipDetector.getIpAddress(); // Fetch the IP address
      setState(() {
        _ipAddress = ipAddress; // Update the state with the fetched IP address
      });
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        _ipAddress = 'Failed to get IP address'; // Handle any errors
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('IP Detector'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Your IP Address: $_ipAddress', // Display the IP address
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The application starts by running the `main` function, which initializes the app.
// The `MyApp` class sets up the MaterialApp with a home screen of `IpDetectorScreen`.
// `IpDetectorScreen` is a stateful widget that manages the state of the IP address display.
// In the `initState` method, `_fetchIpAddress` is called to retrieve the IP address.
// The `RealFlutter` class is used to fetch the IP address asynchronously.
// The fetched IP address is stored in the `_ipAddress` state variable and displayed in the UI.
// If fetching the IP address fails, an error message is displayed instead.
