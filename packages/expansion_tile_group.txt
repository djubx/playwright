# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Expansion Tile Group Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `expansion_tile_group` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  expansion_tile_group: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the `ExpansionTileGroup`, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:expansion_tile_group/expansion_tile_group.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

### Basic Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the `ExpansionTileGroup`:

```dart
ExpansionTileGroup(
  children: <Widget>[
    ExpansionTile(
      title: Text('Tile 1'),
      children: <Widget>[
        ListTile(title: Text('Item 1')),
        ListTile(title: Text('Item 2')),
      ],
    ),
    ExpansionTile(
      title: Text('Tile 2'),
      children: <Widget>[
        ListTile(title: Text('Item 3')),
        ListTile(title: Text('Item 4')),
      ],
    ),
  ],
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

#### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the platform version in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Customization

You can customize the appearance of the `ExpansionTile` and `ExpansionTileGroup` by using various properties such as `backgroundColor`, `iconColor`, and more. Refer to the package documentation for a complete list of customizable properties.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the `expansion_tile_group` package in your Flutter application effectively.

# Complete Example of Using Expansion Tile Group

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:expansion_tile_group/expansion_tile_group.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Expansion Tile Group Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Expansion Tile Group Example'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: ExpansionTileGroup(
            // This is the main group that holds all the expansion tiles
            children: <Widget>[
              ExpansionTile(
                title: Text('Tile 1'),
                // Each tile can have its own children
                children: <Widget>[
                  ListTile(title: Text('Item 1')),
                  ListTile(title: Text('Item 2')),
                ],
              ),
              ExpansionTile(
                title: Text('Tile 2'),
                children: <Widget>[
                  ListTile(title: Text('Item 3')),
                  ListTile(title: Text('Item 4')),
                ],
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Expansion Tile Group Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold has a Padding widget to provide some space around the content.
// 5. Inside the Padding, we have an ExpansionTileGroup that contains two ExpansionTiles.
// 6. Each ExpansionTile has a title and a list of ListTiles as children, which are displayed when the tile is expanded.
// 7. This structure allows users to expand and collapse sections of the UI, making it cleaner and more organized.
