# Complete Example of Using nylo_support

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:nylo_support/nylo_support.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the NyloSupport package
  NyloSupport.init();
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Nylo Support Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  // State variable to hold a message
  String _message = "Welcome to Nylo Support!";

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(_message), // Display the message
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _updateMessage, // Update message on button press
              child: Text('Update Message'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Method to update the message
  void _updateMessage() {
    // Log the action
    NyloSupport.log("Message updated!");
    setState(() {
      _message = "You pressed the button!"; // Change the message
    });
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the NyloSupport package and runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is displayed as the home screen of the app.
// 4. Inside HomeScreen, a state variable _message is initialized with a welcome message.
// 5. The build method creates a UI with a Text widget to display the message and a button.
// 6. When the button is pressed, the _updateMessage method is called.
// 7. This method logs the action using NyloSupport and updates the _message state variable.
// 8. The UI is rebuilt to reflect the new message.
```
