<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Unleash Proxy Client Flutter Package

The `unleash_proxy_client_flutter` package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who want to integrate feature toggling into their applications. This package allows developers to connect to an Unleash server, enabling them to manage feature flags dynamically. By using this package, developers can control the visibility of features in their applications without requiring a new deployment, making it an essential tool for agile development practices.

## When to Use This Package

- **Feature Management**: When you want to enable or disable features in your app without redeploying.
- **A/B Testing**: To test different features with different user segments.
- **Gradual Rollouts**: To gradually roll out new features to a subset of users.
- **Configuration Management**: To manage application configurations dynamically.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Feature Toggles**: Fetch and update feature flags in real-time.
- **Support for Multiple Environments**: Easily switch between different environments (development, staging, production).
- **User Segmentation**: Control feature visibility based on user attributes.
- **Lightweight and Efficient**: Minimal overhead on application performance.

By leveraging the `unleash_proxy_client_flutter` package, developers can enhance their applications' flexibility and responsiveness to user needs.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Unleash Proxy Client Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `unleash_proxy_client_flutter` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `unleash_proxy_client_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  unleash_proxy_client_flutter: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Ensure you have internet permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Initializing the Client

In your Flutter application, you need to initialize the Unleash client. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:unleash_proxy_client_flutter/unleash_proxy_client_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Unleash Proxy Client Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  late UnleashClient unleashClient;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the Unleash client
    unleashClient = UnleashClient(
      url: 'https://your-unleash-server.com/api/',
      appName: 'your-app-name',
      instanceId: 'your-instance-id',
    );
    unleashClient.initialize();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Unleash Proxy Client Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Unleash Client Initialized'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Using Feature Toggles

You can now use the Unleash client to check feature toggles:

```dart
bool isFeatureEnabled = unleashClient.isEnabled('your-feature-toggle');
```

This will return `true` or `false` based on the feature toggle status.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we covered how to set up the `unleash_proxy_client_flutter` package in your Flutter application, including platform-specific configurations for Android and iOS. We also demonstrated how to initialize the Unleash client and check feature toggles.

# Complete Example of Unleash Proxy Client Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:unleash_proxy_client_flutter/unleash_proxy_client_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Unleash Proxy Client Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  late UnleashClient unleashClient; // Declare the Unleash client
  bool isFeatureEnabled = false; // Variable to hold feature toggle status

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the Unleash client with server details
    unleashClient = UnleashClient(
      url: 'https://your-unleash-server.com/api/', // Unleash server URL
      appName: 'your-app-name', // Your application name
      instanceId: 'your-instance-id', // Unique instance ID
    );
    unleashClient.initialize(); // Initialize the client
    // Check if a specific feature is enabled
    isFeatureEnabled = unleashClient.isEnabled('your-feature-toggle');
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Unleash Proxy Client Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Unleash Client Initialized'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Display feature toggle status
            Text(
              isFeatureEnabled ? 'Feature is Enabled' : 'Feature is Disabled',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is a StatefulWidget that initializes the Unleash client in its initState() method.
// 4. The Unleash client is configured with the server URL, app name, and instance ID.
// 5. After initialization, the feature toggle status is checked using isEnabled() method.
// 6. The UI displays whether the feature is enabled or disabled based on the toggle status.
```
