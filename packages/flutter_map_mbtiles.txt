# Flutter Map MBTiles Package

The `flutter_map_mbtiles` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers who want to integrate offline map capabilities into their applications. This package allows you to use MBTiles files, which are SQLite databases that store tilesets, enabling efficient storage and retrieval of map data. 

## When to Use This Package
You should consider using `flutter_map_mbtiles` when:
- You need to display maps in your Flutter application without relying on an internet connection.
- You want to utilize pre-generated map tiles for faster loading times and reduced data usage.
- You are working on applications that require geographical data visualization, such as navigation apps, location-based services, or data analysis tools.

## Features
- **Offline Map Support**: Load and display maps without an internet connection.
- **Integration with Flutter Map**: Seamlessly integrates with the popular `flutter_map` package.
- **Custom Tile Sources**: Use your own MBTiles files for customized map data.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on both Android and iOS platforms.

With these features, `flutter_map_mbtiles` provides a robust solution for developers looking to enhance their Flutter applications with offline mapping capabilities.

# Tutorial: Setting Up flutter_map_mbtiles

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_map_mbtiles` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependencies
First, you need to add the `flutter_map` and `flutter_map_mbtiles` packages to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_map: ^0.14.0
  flutter_map_mbtiles: ^0.5.0
```

## Step 2: Configure Android
For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file. Add the following lines within the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

## Step 3: Configure iOS
For iOS, you need to ensure that your app has the appropriate permissions. Open your `Info.plist` file and add:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your location.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your location.</string>
```

## Step 4: Using the Package
Now that we have set up the dependencies and permissions, we can start using the `flutter_map_mbtiles` package in our application. Below is a simple example of how to implement it.

# Complete Example of Using flutter_map_mbtiles

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_map/flutter_map.dart';
import 'package:flutter_map_mbtiles/flutter_map_mbtiles.dart';
import 'package:latlong2/latlong.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Map MBTiles Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Map MBTiles Example'),
        ),
        body: MapView(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MapView extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return FlutterMap(
      options: MapOptions(
        center: LatLng(51.5, -0.09), // Center the map at a specific location
        zoom: 13.0, // Set the initial zoom level
      ),
      layers: [
        TileLayerOptions(
          // Use MBTiles as the tile source
          tileProvider: MbTilesTileProvider('assets/my_map.mbtiles'),
          // Specify the URL template for the tiles
          urlTemplate: 'mbtiles://my_map.mbtiles',
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and the MapView widget.
// 3. The MapView widget builds a FlutterMap instance.
// 4. The FlutterMap is configured with MapOptions to center the map at specific coordinates and set the zoom level.
// 5. The TileLayerOptions specify the use of MBTiles for the tile source, pointing to the local MBTiles file.
// 6. The map is displayed with the specified tiles, allowing for offline usage.
