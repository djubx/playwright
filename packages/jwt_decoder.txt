Here's a detailed technical blog on the "jwt_decoder" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# JWT Decoder Flutter Package

The `jwt_decoder` package is a powerful tool for decoding JSON Web Tokens (JWT) in Flutter applications. JWTs are widely used for authentication and information exchange in web applications, and this package simplifies the process of decoding them to access the payload data.

## When to Use

You should consider using the `jwt_decoder` package when:
- You need to authenticate users in your Flutter application using JWTs.
- You want to extract claims from a JWT, such as user roles, expiration times, or other custom claims.
- You are building applications that require secure communication between clients and servers.

## Features

- **Decoding JWTs**: Easily decode JWTs to access the payload without needing to verify the signature.
- **Extracting Claims**: Retrieve specific claims from the JWT payload, such as `sub`, `exp`, and custom claims.
- **User-Friendly API**: The package provides a simple and intuitive API for developers.

Overall, the `jwt_decoder` package is an essential tool for Flutter developers working with JWTs, making it easier to manage authentication and user data.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the JWT Decoder Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `jwt_decoder` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  jwt_decoder: ^2.0.1  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to decode a JWT and extract claims.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:jwt_decoder/jwt_decoder.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample JWT for demonstration
    String token = "YOUR_JWT_TOKEN_HERE";

    // Decode the JWT
    Map<String, dynamic> decodedToken = JwtDecoder.decode(token);

    // Extract specific claims
    String userId = decodedToken['sub'];
    DateTime expirationDate = JwtDecoder.getExpirationDate(token);

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('JWT Decoder Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              Text('User ID: $userId'),
              Text('Expiration Date: $expirationDate'),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we decode a JWT and extract the `sub` claim (user ID) and the expiration date. The decoded information is then displayed in a simple Flutter UI.

# Complete Example of JWT Decoder in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:jwt_decoder/jwt_decoder.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample JWT for demonstration
    String token = "YOUR_JWT_TOKEN_HERE"; // Replace with a valid JWT

    // Decode the JWT
    Map<String, dynamic> decodedToken = JwtDecoder.decode(token);

    // Extract specific claims
    String userId = decodedToken['sub']; // Extracting the 'sub' claim
    DateTime expirationDate = JwtDecoder.getExpirationDate(token); // Getting expiration date

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('JWT Decoder Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              Text('User ID: $userId'), // Displaying user ID
              Text('Expiration Date: $expirationDate'), // Displaying expiration date
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the RealFlutter app
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. Inside the RealFlutter widget, a sample JWT token is defined.
// 3. The JWT is decoded using JwtDecoder.decode(), which returns a map of claims.
// 4. The 'sub' claim (user ID) is extracted from the decoded token.
// 5. The expiration date of the token is also retrieved using JwtDecoder.getExpirationDate().
// 6. The user ID and expiration date are displayed in the app's UI using Text widgets.
// 7. The app is structured with a simple MaterialApp and Scaffold for a clean layout.
```
