# Complete Example of Using `uganda_mobile_money`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:uganda_mobile_money/uganda_mobile_money.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Mobile Money Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initialize the UgandaMobileMoney service
              final mobileMoney = UgandaMobileMoney();

              // Attempt to send money
              try {
                // Sending money to a recipient
                final result = await mobileMoney.sendMoney(
                  amount: 10000, // Amount to send
                  recipient: 'recipient_number', // Recipient's mobile number
                );
                // Print success message
                print('Transaction successful: $result');
              } catch (e) {
                // Handle any errors that occur during the transaction
                print('Transaction failed: $e');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Send Money'), // Button text
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the UgandaMobileMoney service is initialized.
// 5. The app attempts to send money to a specified recipient.
// 6. If the transaction is successful, a success message is printed.
// 7. If an error occurs, it is caught and an error message is printed.
