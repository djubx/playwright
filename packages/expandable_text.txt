# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `expandable_text`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `expandable_text` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  expandable_text: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:expandable_text/expandable_text.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Expandable Text Widget

You can now use the `ExpandableText` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
ExpandableText(
  'This is a long text that will be truncated. Click to read more...',
  expandText: 'read more',
  collapseText: 'read less',
  maxLines: 2,
  linkColor: Colors.blue,
)
```

### Customization Options

- **maxLines**: Set the maximum number of lines to display before truncating.
- **expandText**: Text to display when the text is expanded.
- **collapseText**: Text to display when the text is collapsed.
- **linkColor**: Color of the expand/collapse link.

With these steps, you can easily integrate the `expandable_text` package into your Flutter application and customize it to fit your needs.

# Complete Example of Using `expandable_text`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:expandable_text/expandable_text.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Expandable Text Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Expandable Text Demo'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Column(
            children: [
              // Using ExpandableText widget to display long text
              ExpandableText(
                'Flutter is an open-source UI software development toolkit created by Google. '
                'It is used to develop applications for Android, iOS, Linux, Mac, Windows, '
                'Google Fuchsia, and the web from a single codebase. Flutter is based on the Dart programming language.',
                expandText: 'read more',
                collapseText: 'read less',
                maxLines: 2, // Maximum lines to show before truncating
                linkColor: Colors.blue, // Color of the expand/collapse link
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with MyApp().
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body consists of a Padding widget that adds space around the content.
// 5. Inside the body, we use the ExpandableText widget to display a long text.
// 6. The ExpandableText widget allows users to expand or collapse the text, enhancing readability.
// 7. The maxLines property limits the initial display to 2 lines, and the linkColor property sets the color of the expand/collapse link.
```
