# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Speech to Text Ultra

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **speech_to_text_ultra** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the **speech_to_text_ultra** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  speech_to_text_ultra: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/speech_to_text_ultra).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request microphone access:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for speech recognition.</string>
<key>NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to speech recognition services.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to implement speech recognition.

# Complete Example: Speech to Text Ultra in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:speech_to_text_ultra/speech_to_text_ultra.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  SpeechToTextUltra _speechToText;
  bool _isListening = false;
  String _text = "Press the button and start speaking";

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _speechToText = SpeechToTextUltra();
  }

  // Function to start listening to speech
  void _startListening() async {
    await _speechToText.initialize();
    setState(() {
      _isListening = true;
      _text = "Listening...";
    });

    // Start listening for speech
    _speechToText.listen(onResult: (result) {
      setState(() {
        _text = result.recognizedWords; // Update text with recognized words
      });
    });
  }

  // Function to stop listening
  void _stopListening() async {
    await _speechToText.stop();
    setState(() {
      _isListening = false;
      _text = "Press the button and start speaking"; // Reset text
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Speech to Text Ultra Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text(
                _text,
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _isListening ? _stopListening : _startListening,
                child: Text(_isListening ? 'Stop Listening' : 'Start Listening'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget, we initialize the SpeechToTextUltra instance.
// 3. The user can press the button to start or stop listening for speech input.
// 4. When listening starts, the app updates the UI to indicate that it is listening.
// 5. As the user speaks, the recognized words are updated in the text widget.
// 6. Pressing the button again stops the listening process and resets the text.
```
