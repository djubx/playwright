# Setting Up the Package
-------------------------

To use the `apple_passkit` package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Flutter Project

Add the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  apple_passkit: ^1.0.0
```
Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Configure the Package

Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:apple_passkit/apple_passkit.dart';
```
### Step 3: Set Up the PassKit Framework

To set up the PassKit framework, you need to create a `Pass` object and add it to the Wallet app. You can do this by using the `PassKit` class:
```dart
PassKit passKit = PassKit();
Pass pass = Pass(
  passTypeIdentifier: 'your_pass_type_identifier',
  serialNumber: 'your_serial_number',
  description: 'your_description',
);
passKit.addPass(pass);
```
### Step 4: Handle PassKit Events

To handle PassKit events, such as when a pass is added or removed, you can use the `PassKit` class:
```dart
passKit.onPassAdded.listen((pass) {
  print('Pass added: ${pass.description}');
});
passKit.onPassRemoved.listen((pass) {
  print('Pass removed: ${pass.description}');
});
```
### Platform-Specific Details

For iOS, you need to add the following lines to your `Info.plist` file:
```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
  <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
  <true/>
</dict>
```
For Android, you don't need to do anything.

            children: <Widget>[
              ElevatedButton(

                  _passKit.addPass(_pass);
                },
                child: Text('Add Pass'),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  _passKit.removePass(_pass);
                },
                child: Text('Remove Pass'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user opens the app and is presented with two buttons: "Add Pass" and "Remove Pass".
// 2. When the user clicks the "Add Pass" button, the app creates a new Pass object and adds it to the Wallet app using the PassKit class.
// 3. When the user clicks the "Remove Pass" button, the app removes the Pass object from the Wallet app using the PassKit class.
// 4. The app listens for PassKit events, such as when a pass is added or removed, and prints a message to the console when an event occurs.
// 5. The app uses the PassKit class to handle all interactions with the Wallet app and the PassKit framework.
