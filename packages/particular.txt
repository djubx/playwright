<!-- START_TUTORIAL -->
# Getting Started with RealFlutter

## Setup Process
To get started with the RealFlutter package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add Dependency
Add the RealFlutter package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  real_flutter: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

### Step 2: Install Packages
Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

### Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

#### iOS

# Complete Example of RealFlutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:real_flutter/real_flutter.dart'; // Importing the RealFlutter package

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp()); // Entry point of the application
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'RealFlutter Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(), // Setting the home page of the app
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('RealFlutter Demo'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: RealFlutterButton( // Using a custom button from RealFlutter
          onPressed: () {
            // Action to perform on button press
            showDialog(
              context: context,
              builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                title: Text('Hello!'),
                content: Text('You pressed the RealFlutter button!'),
                actions: [
                  TextButton(
                    onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                    child: Text('Close'),
                  ),
                ],
              ),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Press Me'), // Button text
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to HomePage, which is another StatelessWidget.
// 4. HomePage builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a RealFlutterButton is created.
// 6. When the button is pressed, a dialog is shown with a message.
// 7. The dialog contains a close button that dismisses the dialog when pressed.
```

// The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `MyApp` widget. 
// `MyApp` sets up the Material design and specifies `HomePage` as the main screen. 
// `HomePage` contains a button from the RealFlutter package. 
// When the button is pressed, an alert dialog appears, demonstrating the interaction with the user. 
// This flow showcases how to integrate and utilize the RealFlutter package effectively in a Flutter application.
