# Tutorial
==========

## Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

To use the `sliver_fill_remaining_box_adapter` package, you need to add it to your project. You can do this by adding the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  sliver_fill_remaining_box_adapter: ^1.0.0
```

## Step 2: Import the Package

After adding the package to your project, you need to import it in your Dart file. You can do this by adding the following line at the top of your file:

```dart
import 'package:sliver_fill_remaining_box_adapter/sliver_fill_remaining_box_adapter.dart';
```

## Step 3: Use the Package

To use the package, you need to create a `CustomScrollView` widget and add a `SliverFillRemainingBoxAdapter` widget to it. The `SliverFillRemainingBoxAdapter` widget takes a `child` property, which is the widget that will be used to fill the remaining space.

Here is an example:

```dart
CustomScrollView(
  slivers: [
    SliverFillRemainingBoxAdapter(
      child: Container(
        color: Colors.red,
      ),
    ),
  ],
)
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sliver_fill_remaining_box_adapter/sliver_fill_remaining_box_adapter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sliver Fill Remaining Box Adapter Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Sliver Fill Remaining Box Adapter Demo'),
      ),
      body: CustomScrollView(
        slivers: [
          // Create a SliverFillRemainingBoxAdapter widget
          SliverFillRemainingBoxAdapter(
            // The child property is the widget that will be used to fill the remaining space
            child: Container(
              color: Colors.red,
              // Add a Text widget to the Container to display some text
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'This is the remaining space',
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and the MyApp widget is created.
// 2. The MyApp widget builds the MaterialApp widget, which is the root widget of the app.
// 3. The MaterialApp widget builds the MyHomePage widget, which is the home page of the app.
// 4. The MyHomePage widget builds the Scaffold widget, which is the basic material design visual layout structure.
// 5. The Scaffold widget builds the CustomScrollView widget, which is a scrollable area that can contain multiple widgets.
// 6. The CustomScrollView widget builds the SliverFillRemainingBoxAdapter widget, which is used to fill the remaining space in the scrollable area.
// 7. The SliverFillRemainingBoxAdapter widget builds the Container widget, which is used to display some text in the remaining space.

// In summary, the code flows from the MyApp widget to the MyHomePage widget to the Scaffold widget to the CustomScrollView widget to the SliverFillRemainingBoxAdapter widget to the Container widget.
