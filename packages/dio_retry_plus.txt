# dio_retry_plus: A Comprehensive Overview

The `dio_retry_plus` package is an extension of the popular Dio HTTP client for Flutter, designed to provide enhanced retry capabilities for network requests. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where network reliability is a concern, such as mobile applications that may experience intermittent connectivity issues.

## When to Use dio_retry_plus
- **Intermittent Network Conditions**: Ideal for applications that need to handle unreliable network connections gracefully.
- **API Rate Limiting**: Useful when dealing with APIs that may limit the number of requests, allowing for retries after a specified delay.
- **Error Handling**: Simplifies error handling by automatically retrying failed requests based on customizable conditions.

## Key Features
- **Customizable Retry Logic**: Define how many times a request should be retried and under what conditions.
- **Exponential Backoff**: Automatically increases the wait time between retries, reducing the load on the server.
- **Integration with Dio**: Seamlessly integrates with the Dio HTTP client, leveraging its existing features.

Overall, `dio_retry_plus` enhances the robustness of network requests in Flutter applications, making it a valuable addition to any developer's toolkit.

# Setting Up dio_retry_plus: A Step-by-Step Guide

## Installation
To use the `dio_retry_plus` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  dio: ^5.0.0
  dio_retry_plus: ^1.0.0
```

After adding the dependencies, run the following command to install them:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` to allow network requests. Ensure you have the following entry:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
To use `dio_retry_plus`, you need to create an instance of Dio and configure it with the retry options. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:dio/dio.dart';
import 'package:dio_retry_plus/dio_retry_plus.dart';

void main() {
  final dio = Dio();
  final retryOptions = RetryOptions(
    retries: 3, // Number of retries
    delay: Duration(seconds: 2), // Delay between retries
  );

  dio.interceptors.add(RetryInterceptor(dio: dio, options: retryOptions));

  // Now you can make requests with automatic retries
}
```

This setup will automatically retry any failed requests up to three times with a two-second delay between each attempt.

With this guide, you should be able to integrate `dio_retry_plus` into your Flutter application effectively.

# Complete Example of dio_retry_plus in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dio/dio.dart';
import 'package:dio_retry_plus/dio_retry_plus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dio Retry Plus Example',
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  final Dio _dio = Dio();
  String _response = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Configure retry options
    final retryOptions = RetryOptions(
      retries: 3, // Set the number of retries
      delay: Duration(seconds: 2), // Set the delay between retries
    );

    // Add the retry interceptor to Dio
    _dio.interceptors.add(RetryInterceptor(dio: _dio, options: retryOptions));
  }

  // Function to make a network request
  Future<void> _makeRequest() async {
    try {
      // Make a GET request to a sample API
      final response = await _dio.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1');
      setState(() {
        _response = response.data.toString(); // Update the response state
      });
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        _response = 'Request failed: $e'; // Handle request failure
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Dio Retry Plus Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _makeRequest, // Trigger the network request
              child: Text('Make Request'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(_response), // Display the response or error message
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a home page (MyHomePage).
// 3. In MyHomePage, we initialize Dio and configure the retry options in initState.
// 4. When the "Make Request" button is pressed, the _makeRequest function is called.
// 5. The _makeRequest function attempts to fetch data from a sample API.
// 6. If the request fails, it will automatically retry up to 3 times with a 2-second delay.
// 7. The response or error message is displayed on the screen.
