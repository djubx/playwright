# Setting Up and Using the Flutter Paymob Package

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_paymob` package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Installation

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_paymob` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_paymob: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_paymob).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. **Add Permissions**: Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS
1. **Update Info.plist**: Open your `Info.plist` file and add the following:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

## Using the Package

Once you have installed the package and configured your project, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to initiate a payment:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_paymob/flutter_paymob.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Paymob Payment Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initialize Paymob with your API key
              final paymob = FlutterPaymob(apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY');

              // Start the payment process
              final result = await paymob.startPayment(
                amount: 100.0, // Amount in EGP
                currency: 'EGP',
                orderId: '12345',
              );

              // Handle the payment result
              if (result.success) {
                // Payment was successful
                print('Payment successful: ${result.transactionId}');
              } else {
                // Payment failed
                print('Payment failed: ${result.errorMessage}');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Pay Now'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize the Paymob payment process and handle the result accordingly. Make sure to replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your actual Paymob API key.

# Complete Example of Flutter Paymob Integration

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_paymob/flutter_paymob.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Paymob Payment Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initialize Paymob with your API key
              final paymob = FlutterPaymob(apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY');

              // Start the payment process
              final result = await paymob.startPayment(
                amount: 100.0, // Amount in EGP
                currency: 'EGP',
                orderId: '12345',
              );

              // Handle the payment result
              if (result.success) {
                // Payment was successful
                print('Payment successful: ${result.transactionId}');
              } else {
                // Payment failed
                print('Payment failed: ${result.errorMessage}');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Pay Now'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with a MaterialApp widget that contains a Scaffold.
// 2. An AppBar is created with the title 'Paymob Payment Example'.
// 3. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 4. An ElevatedButton is displayed with the text 'Pay Now'.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the onPressed callback is triggered.
// 6. Inside the callback, we initialize the FlutterPaymob instance with the API key.
// 7. We call the startPayment method with the amount, currency, and order ID.
// 8. The result of the payment process is awaited.
// 9. If the payment is successful, we print the transaction ID; otherwise, we print the error message.
```
