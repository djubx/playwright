# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Gradient Borders Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `gradient_borders` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  gradient_borders: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to apply a gradient border to a container.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gradient_borders/gradient_borders.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Gradient Borders Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Container(
          width: 200,
          height: 200,
          decoration: BoxDecoration(
            color: Colors.white,
            border: GradientBorder(
              gradient: LinearGradient(
                colors: [Colors.blue, Colors.purple],
              ),
              width: 5,
            ),
          ),
          child: Center(child: Text('Hello, Flutter!')),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(home: RealFlutter()));
}
```

In this example, we create a `Container` with a gradient border using the `GradientBorder` class. The `LinearGradient` is defined with two colors, blue and purple, and the border width is set to 5.

# Complete Example of Gradient Borders in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gradient_borders/gradient_borders.dart';

// Main class of the application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Gradient Borders Example')), // App bar with title
      body: Center(
        child: Container(
          width: 200, // Width of the container
          height: 200, // Height of the container
          decoration: BoxDecoration(
            color: Colors.white, // Background color of the container
            border: GradientBorder(
              gradient: LinearGradient(
                colors: [Colors.blue, Colors.purple], // Gradient colors
              ),
              width: 5, // Width of the gradient border
            ),
          ),
          child: Center(child: Text('Hello, Flutter!')), // Centered text inside the container
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(home: RealFlutter())); // Run the app with RealFlutter as the home widget
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp().
// 2. runApp() initializes the MaterialApp widget, setting RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget builds a Scaffold, which provides the basic visual structure.
// 4. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'Gradient Borders Example'.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget, which centers its child.
// 6. The child of the Center is a Container with a specified width and height.
// 7. The Container has a white background and a gradient border defined by the GradientBorder class.
// 8. Inside the Container, there is a Center widget that contains a Text widget displaying 'Hello, Flutter!'.
