Here's a detailed technical blog on the `nhost_sdk` Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Nhost SDK Flutter Package

The `nhost_sdk` Flutter package is a powerful tool that allows developers to integrate Nhost's backend services into their Flutter applications seamlessly. Nhost provides a serverless backend that includes features like authentication, database management, and file storage, making it an excellent choice for developers looking to build scalable applications without managing their own infrastructure.

## When to Use Nhost SDK

You should consider using the `nhost_sdk` Flutter package when:
- You need a backend solution that offers authentication, real-time databases, and file storage.
- You want to focus on building your application without worrying about server management.
- You are developing applications that require user authentication and data storage.

## Key Features
- **Authentication**: Easily manage user sign-up, login, and session management.
- **Real-time Database**: Utilize a PostgreSQL database with real-time capabilities.
- **File Storage**: Store and manage files securely.
- **GraphQL API**: Interact with your backend using GraphQL queries and mutations.

The `nhost_sdk` package simplifies the integration of these features into your Flutter applications, allowing you to focus on building great user experiences.

# Tutorial: Setting Up Nhost SDK in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `nhost_sdk` Flutter package and demonstrate how to use it in your application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `nhost_sdk` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  nhost_sdk: ^0.5.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Configure Nhost

Before using the SDK, you need to configure it with your Nhost project details. You can create a new Nhost project by visiting [Nhost](https://nhost.io) and following the setup instructions.

Once you have your project, you will need the Nhost backend URL and the Nhost GraphQL endpoint. These can be found in your Nhost dashboard.

## Step 3: Initialize Nhost SDK

In your main Dart file, initialize the Nhost SDK with your project details:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:nhost_sdk/nhost_sdk.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize Nhost SDK with your backend URL
  Nhost.initialize(
    backendUrl: 'https://backend-xxxx.nhost.app', // Replace with your backend URL
  );
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 4: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `Info.plist` to allow network requests:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
  <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
  <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 5: Using Nhost SDK

You can now use the Nhost SDK to manage authentication and data. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to sign up a user:

```dart
final response = await Nhost.auth.signUp(email: 'user@example.com', password: 'password123');
if (response.error == null) {
  // User signed up successfully
} else {
  // Handle error
}
```

This is a basic overview of how to set up and use the `nhost_sdk` Flutter package. You can explore more features like file storage and real-time subscriptions in the official documentation.

# Complete Example: Nhost SDK in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:nhost_sdk/nhost_sdk.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize Nhost SDK with your backend URL
  Nhost.initialize(
    backendUrl: 'https://backend-xxxx.nhost.app', // Replace with your backend URL
  );
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Nhost SDK Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  String _message = '';

  // Function to handle user sign-up
  Future<void> _signUp() async {
    final response = await Nhost.auth.signUp(
      email: 'user@example.com',
      password: 'password123',
    );

    if (response.error == null) {
      setState(() {
        _message = 'User signed up successfully!';
      });
    } else {
      setState(() {
        _message = 'Error: ${response.error.message}';
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Nhost SDK Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(_message), // Display the message
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _signUp, // Call sign-up function on button press
              child: Text('Sign Up'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts by initializing the Nhost SDK with the backend URL.
// 2. The main widget is a MaterialApp that sets the HomeScreen as the home.
// 3. In the HomeScreen, a button is provided to trigger the sign-up process.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the _signUp function is called.
// 5. The _signUp function attempts to sign up a user with the provided email and password.
// 6. If successful, a success message is displayed; otherwise, an error message is shown.
```
