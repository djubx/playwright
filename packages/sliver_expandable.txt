# Sliver Expandable Package Overview
=====================================

The `sliver_expandable` package is a Flutter library that provides a widget for creating expandable and collapsible content. It is designed to work seamlessly with the `CustomScrollView` and `SliverList` widgets.

### When to Use

This package is useful when you need to display a large amount of content, but want to give the user the option to collapse or expand it. It's perfect for scenarios like:

* Displaying a long list of items with optional details
* Creating an accordion-style interface
* Showing and hiding content based on user interaction

### Features

* Expandable and collapsible content
* Customizable animation duration and curve
* Support for multiple expandable sections
* Works with `CustomScrollView` and `SliverList`

# Setting Up and Using the Package
=====================================

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

Add the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  sliver_expandable: ^1.0.0
```
Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:
```dart
import 'package:sliver_expandable/sliver_expandable.dart';
```
### Step 3: Create an Expandable Section

Create a `SliverExpandable` widget and pass in the content you want to make expandable:
```dart
SliverExpandable(
  header: Text('Header'),
  content: Text('Content'),
)
```
### Step 4: Add the Expandable Section to Your ScrollView

Add the `SliverExpandable` widget to your `CustomScrollView` or `SliverList`:
```dart
CustomScrollView(
  slivers: [
    SliverExpandable(
      header: Text('Header'),
      content: Text('Content'),
    ),
  ],
)
```
### Platform-Specific Details

* On Android, you may need to adjust the ` animationDuration` property to achieve the desired animation speed.
* On iOS, you can use the ` curve` property to customize the animation curve.

### Configurations and Optimizations

* You can customize the animation duration and curve using the `animationDuration` and `curve` properties.
* You can also use the `initiallyExpanded` property to set the initial state of the expandable section.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sliver_expandable/sliver_expandable.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sliver Expandable Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Sliver Expandable Demo'),
      ),
      body: CustomScrollView(
        slivers: [
          // Create an expandable section with a header and content
          SliverExpandable(
            header: Text('Header 1'),
            content: Text('Content 1'),
          ),
          // Create another expandable section with a header and content
          SliverExpandable(
            header: Text('Header 2'),
            content: Text('Content 2'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a list of expandable sections.
// 2. The user taps on an expandable section to expand or collapse it.
// 3. The animation is played and the content is revealed or hidden.
// 4. The user can repeat steps 2-3 to expand or collapse multiple sections.
// The SliverExpandable widget handles the animation and state changes for each section.

// Final summary: The code creates a list of expandable sections using the SliverExpandable widget.
// The user can tap on each section to expand or collapse it, and the animation is handled by the widget.
// The code is a simple demonstration of how to use the SliverExpandable package to create a list of expandable sections.
