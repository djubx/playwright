# flutter_svg_icons: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with `flutter_svg_icons`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_svg_icons: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_svg_icons).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable the use of SVG files in your project. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>UIAppFonts</key>
<array>
    <string>YourFontName.ttf</string>
</array>
```

## Using flutter_svg_icons
Once the package is installed, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use an SVG icon:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_svg_icons/flutter_svg_icons.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('SVG Icons Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: SvgIcon(
            icon: SvgIcons.home, // Using a predefined SVG icon
            size: 100.0, // Setting the size of the icon
            color: Colors.blue, // Changing the color of the icon
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we import the necessary packages, create a simple app with an AppBar, and display an SVG icon in the center of the screen. You can customize the size and color of the icon as needed.

# Complete Example of flutter_svg_icons

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_svg_icons/flutter_svg_icons.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('SVG Icons Example'), // Title of the app
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center, // Centering the column
            children: <Widget>[
              SvgIcon(
                icon: SvgIcons.home, // Using a predefined SVG icon
                size: 100.0, // Setting the size of the icon
                color: Colors.blue, // Changing the color of the icon
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              SvgIcon(
                icon: SvgIcons.settings, // Another SVG icon
                size: 100.0, // Setting the size of the icon
                color: Colors.green, // Changing the color of the icon
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the RealFlutter app
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'SVG Icons Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered using a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to stack the SVG icons vertically.
// 6. The first SvgIcon displays a home icon in blue color, sized at 100.0.
// 7. A SizedBox is used to add space between the two icons.
// 8. The second SvgIcon displays a settings icon in green color, also sized at 100.0.
// 9. The app is responsive and the icons maintain their quality across different screen sizes.
