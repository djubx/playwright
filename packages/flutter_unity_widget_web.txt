// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user launches the app, and the `RealFlutter` widget is created.
// 2. The `_initUnity` method is called, which creates a `UnityWidget` instance and initializes the Unity content.
// 3. The `UnityWidget` instance is added to the widget tree, and the Unity content is rendered.
// 4. The user interacts with the Unity content, and the `onUnityMessage` callback is triggered.
// 5. The `onUnitySceneLoaded` callback is triggered when the Unity scene is loaded.
// 6. The app continues to run, and the user can interact with the Unity content.
