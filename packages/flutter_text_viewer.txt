# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `flutter_text_viewer`

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_text_viewer` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_text_viewer` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_text_viewer: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that the package is set up, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `flutter_text_viewer` package in your app.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_text_viewer/flutter_text_viewer.dart';
```

2. Create a simple Flutter app that uses the `TextViewer` widget:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Text Viewer Example',
      home: TextViewerExample(),
    );
  }
}

class TextViewerExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Text Viewer Example'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: TextViewer(
          text: 'This is an example of using the flutter_text_viewer package. '
              'You can display long text content easily with this package.',
          textStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 16, color: Colors.black),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays a text viewer with some sample text. The `TextViewer` widget is used to render the text, and we customize its appearance using the `textStyle` property.

Now you can run your application, and you should see the text displayed in a scrollable view.

# Complete Example of `flutter_text_viewer`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_text_viewer/flutter_text_viewer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Text Viewer Example',
      home: TextViewerExample(),
    );
  }
}

class TextViewerExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Text Viewer Example'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: TextViewer(
          text: 'This is an example of using the flutter_text_viewer package. '
              'You can display long text content easily with this package.',
          textStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 16, color: Colors.black),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a title and a home property that points to the TextViewerExample widget.
// 4. The TextViewerExample class builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 5. The body contains a Padding widget that adds space around the TextViewer.
// 6. The TextViewer widget displays the provided text with the specified text style.
// 7. When the app runs, it shows the text in a scrollable view, allowing users to read long content easily.
