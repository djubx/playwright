# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Super Keyboard Layout

## Installation
To add the `super_keyboard_layout` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  super_keyboard_layout: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
- Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` has the necessary permissions if you are using features that require them.
- No additional setup is typically required for basic usage.

### iOS
- For iOS, ensure that your app's deployment target is set to a version that supports the package features.
- You may need to adjust your app's Info.plist for specific functionalities.

## Basic Usage
To use the `super_keyboard_layout`, you need to create an instance of the keyboard layout in your widget tree. Here’s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:super_keyboard_layout/super_keyboard_layout.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Super Keyboard Layout Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: SuperKeyboardLayout(
            layout: CustomKeyboardLayout(), // Define your custom layout here
            onKeyPressed: (key) {
              // Handle key press events
              print('Key pressed: $key');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that uses the `SuperKeyboardLayout` widget. The `onKeyPressed` callback allows you to handle key events as needed.

# Complete Example of Super Keyboard Layout

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:super_keyboard_layout/super_keyboard_layout.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Super Keyboard Layout Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: SuperKeyboardLayout(
            layout: CustomKeyboardLayout(), // Define your custom keyboard layout
            onKeyPressed: (key) {
              // Handle key press events
              print('Key pressed: $key'); // Log the key pressed
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// CustomKeyboardLayout is a placeholder for your actual keyboard layout definition
class CustomKeyboardLayout extends KeyboardLayout {
  @override
  List<KeyboardKey> get keys => [
        KeyboardKey(label: 'A', onPressed: () => print('A pressed')),
        KeyboardKey(label: 'B', onPressed: () => print('B pressed')),
        // Add more keys as needed
      ];
}

// The main function is the entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main function, which calls runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
3. Inside the Center widget, the SuperKeyboardLayout is instantiated with a custom layout and an onKeyPressed callback.
4. When a key is pressed on the custom keyboard, the corresponding onPressed function is executed, logging the key pressed to the console.
5. The CustomKeyboardLayout class defines the keys available on the keyboard, allowing for easy customization of the keyboard's functionality.
