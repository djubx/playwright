# Fadable App Bar: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the `fadable_app_bar` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  fadable_app_bar: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/fadable_app_bar).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `fadable_app_bar`, you will typically wrap your scrollable content with the `FadableAppBar` widget. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fadable_app_bar/fadable_app_bar.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: FadableAppBar(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Fadable App Bar Example'),
        ),
        body: ListView.builder(
          itemCount: 100,
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            return ListTile(
              title: Text('Item $index'),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `FadableAppBar` widget wraps around a `ListView`, allowing the app bar to fade in and out as the user scrolls through the list.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the `fadable_app_bar` package into your Flutter application seamlessly.

# Complete Example of Fadable App Bar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fadable_app_bar/fadable_app_bar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Fadable App Bar Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      // Using FadableAppBar to create a dynamic app bar
      body: FadableAppBar(
        // Defining the app bar with a title
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Fadable App Bar Example'),
        ),
        // The body of the app, which is a scrollable ListView
        body: ListView.builder(
          itemCount: 100, // Number of items in the list
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            // Each item in the list is a ListTile
            return ListTile(
              title: Text('Item $index'), // Displaying item number
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget is the main screen of the app.
// 4. Inside RealFlutter, a Scaffold is created with a FadableAppBar.
// 5. The FadableAppBar contains an AppBar with a title and a ListView as its body.
// 6. The ListView.builder creates a scrollable list of 100 items.
// 7. As the user scrolls down, the app bar fades out, and it fades back in when scrolling up.
