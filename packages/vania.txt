# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Vania

## Step 1: Adding Vania to Your Project

To get started with the Vania package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and include the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  vania: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # Ensure this is set to at least 10.0
```

## Step 3: Using Vania in Your Application

Now that you have set up the Vania package, you can start using its features in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a basic app using Vania widgets.

1. Import the Vania package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:vania/vania.dart';
```

2. Use Vania widgets in your widget tree. For example, you can create a simple app with a Vania button and a text display.

```dart
class RealFlutterApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Vania Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: VaniaButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Action when button is pressed
            },
            child: Text('Click Me'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

With these steps, you are now ready to leverage the Vania package in your Flutter applications!

# Complete Example of Vania in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:vania/vania.dart'; // Importing the Vania package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutterApp()); // Running the main application
}

class RealFlutterApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Vania Flutter Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue, // Setting the primary color
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(), // Setting the home screen
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Screen'), // Title of the app bar
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: VaniaButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Action when the button is pressed
            showDialog(
              context: context,
              builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                title: Text('Button Pressed!'), // Dialog title
                content: Text('You have pressed the Vania button.'), // Dialog content
                actions: [
                  TextButton(
                    onPressed: () {
                      Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                    },
                    child: Text('OK'), // Button to close the dialog
                  ),
                ],
              ),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Press Me'), // Button text
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with RealFlutterApp.
// 2. RealFlutterApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is displayed as the home screen of the app.
// 4. The HomeScreen contains a VaniaButton in the center of the screen.
// 5. When the button is pressed, an AlertDialog is shown with a message.
// 6. The user can dismiss the dialog by pressing the 'OK' button.
```
