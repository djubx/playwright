# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Simple Speed Dial

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the **simple_speed_dial** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  simple_speed_dial: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:simple_speed_dial/simple_speed_dial.dart';
```

## Step 4: Basic Setup
You can now use the `SimpleSpeedDial` widget in your application. Below is a basic example of how to implement it:

### Android Configuration
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions if you are using features that require them (like internet access).

### iOS Configuration
For iOS, ensure that your `Info.plist` file is configured correctly for any permissions you might need.

## Step 5: Customizing the Speed Dial
You can customize the speed dial by providing a list of actions, each with its own icon and label. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
SimpleSpeedDial(
  child: Icon(Icons.add),
  children: [
    SpeedDialChild(
      child: Icon(Icons.accessibility),
      label: 'Accessibility',
      onTap: () => print('Accessibility tapped'),
    ),
    SpeedDialChild(
      child: Icon(Icons.settings),
      label: 'Settings',
      onTap: () => print('Settings tapped'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

This code creates a speed dial with two options: Accessibility and Settings.

# Complete Example of Simple Speed Dial

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simple_speed_dial/simple_speed_dial.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Simple Speed Dial Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Speed Dial Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Press the button below to see the speed dial!'),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: SimpleSpeedDial(
        child: Icon(Icons.add), // Main button icon
        children: [
          SpeedDialChild(
            child: Icon(Icons.accessibility), // Child button icon
            label: 'Accessibility', // Child button label
            onTap: () {
              // Action for Accessibility button
              print('Accessibility tapped');
            },
          ),
          SpeedDialChild(
            child: Icon(Icons.settings), // Child button icon
            label: 'Settings', // Child button label
            onTap: () {
              // Action for Settings button
              print('Settings tapped');
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. HomeScreen contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget displaying a message.
// 4. The floatingActionButton is a SimpleSpeedDial widget.
// 5. The SimpleSpeedDial has a main button (with a '+' icon) and two child buttons (Accessibility and Settings).
// 6. Tapping on a child button triggers the onTap function, which currently prints a message to the console.
