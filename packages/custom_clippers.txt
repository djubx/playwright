<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Custom Clippers Flutter Package

The **custom_clippers** Flutter package is a powerful tool that allows developers to create custom-shaped widgets in their Flutter applications. This package provides a variety of clipper classes that can be used to create unique UI designs by clipping the widget's shape. 

## When to Use This Package
You might want to use the **custom_clippers** package when:
- You need to create non-rectangular shapes for your widgets, such as circles, triangles, or complex polygons.
- You want to enhance the visual appeal of your application with custom designs.
- You are building a UI that requires specific shapes for images, buttons, or containers.

## Features
- **Multiple Clipper Classes**: The package includes several predefined clipper classes, such as `DiagonalClipper`, `WaveClipper`, and `ArcClipper`, which can be easily integrated into your widgets.
- **Custom Clipping**: You can create your own custom clipper by extending the `CustomClipper` class, allowing for complete control over the shape of your widgets.
- **Easy Integration**: The package is designed to be easily integrated into existing Flutter projects with minimal setup.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Custom Clippers

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the **custom_clippers** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  custom_clippers: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:custom_clippers/custom_clippers.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using Predefined Clippers
You can use the predefined clippers directly in your widget tree. Here’s an example of how to use the `DiagonalClipper`:

```dart
ClipPath(
  clipper: DiagonalClipper(),
  child: Container(
    height: 200,
    color: Colors.blue,
  ),
)
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 9.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
```

## Step 4: Creating Custom Clippers
To create a custom clipper, extend the `CustomClipper` class and override the `getClip` method. Here’s a simple example:

```dart
class MyCustomClipper extends CustomClipper<Path> {
  @override
  Path getClip(Size size) {
    var path = Path();
    path.lineTo(size.width, 0);
    path.lineTo(size.width, size.height);
    path.close();
    return path;
  }

  @override
  bool shouldReclip(CustomClipper<Path> oldClipper) {
    return false;
  }
}
```

You can then use this custom clipper in your widget tree just like the predefined ones.

# Complete Example of Using Custom Clippers

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:custom_clippers/custom_clippers.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Custom Clippers Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Custom Clippers Example'),
        ),
        body: Column(
          children: [
            // Using a predefined DiagonalClipper
            ClipPath(
              clipper: DiagonalClipper(),
              child: Container(
                height: 200,
                color: Colors.blue,
                child: Center(
                  child: Text(
                    'Diagonal Clipper',
                    style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24),
                  ),
                ),
              ),
            ),
            // Using a custom clipper
            ClipPath(
              clipper: MyCustomClipper(),
              child: Container(
                height: 200,
                color: Colors.red,
                child: Center(
                  child: Text(
                    'Custom Clipper',
                    style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24),
                  ),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a body with a Column widget.
// 4. The first child of the Column is a ClipPath widget using the DiagonalClipper.
//    - This creates a blue container with a diagonal cut.
// 5. The second child is another ClipPath widget using MyCustomClipper.
//    - This creates a red container with a custom shape defined in MyCustomClipper.
// 6. Each container has centered text to indicate which clipper is being used.
```
