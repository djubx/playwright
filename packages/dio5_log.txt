// The app starts by initializing Dio and adding the DioLogInterceptor to log network requests and responses.
// A RealFlutter class instance is created with the Dio instance.
// The app uses the RealFlutter instance to make GET and POST requests to the specified URLs.
// The responses are printed to the console.
// The app also handles errors and exceptions that may occur during the requests.
// The DioLogInterceptor logs the network requests and responses, making it easier to debug and optimize the app.
