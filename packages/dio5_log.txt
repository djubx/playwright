# dio5_log: A Comprehensive Overview

The `dio5_log` package is a powerful logging tool designed to enhance the capabilities of the Dio HTTP client in Flutter applications. It provides a simple way to log HTTP requests and responses, making it easier for developers to debug and monitor network activity. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to track API calls, analyze performance, or troubleshoot issues in your Flutter applications.

## When to Use dio5_log
- **Debugging Network Requests**: When you need to inspect the details of HTTP requests and responses.
- **Performance Monitoring**: To log the time taken for requests, helping identify bottlenecks.
- **Error Tracking**: To capture and log errors that occur during network operations.

## Key Features
- **Request and Response Logging**: Automatically logs all HTTP requests and responses.
- **Customizable Log Format**: Allows customization of the log output format to suit your needs.
- **Integration with Dio**: Seamlessly integrates with the Dio HTTP client, making it easy to implement in existing projects.
- **Support for Interceptors**: Works with Dio's interceptor system, enabling advanced logging capabilities.

Overall, `dio5_log` is an essential tool for any Flutter developer looking to improve their application's network handling and debugging capabilities.

# Setting Up dio5_log in Your Flutter Project

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `dio5_log` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Installation

To add `dio5_log` to your Flutter project, follow these steps:

1. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file.
2. Add the following dependency:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     dio: ^5.0.0
     dio5_log: ^1.0.0
   ```

3. Run `flutter pub get` to install the new packages.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable network logging in your `Info.plist` file by adding the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Using dio5_log

To use `dio5_log`, you need to set up Dio with the logging interceptor. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

1. Import the necessary packages:

   ```dart
   import 'package:dio/dio.dart';
   import 'package:dio5_log/dio5_log.dart';
   ```

2. Create an instance of Dio and add the logging interceptor:

   ```dart
   void setupDio() {
     final dio = Dio();
     dio.interceptors.add(Dio5LogInterceptor());
   }
   ```

3. Now, you can make HTTP requests using this configured Dio instance, and all requests and responses will be logged automatically.

With this setup, you are ready to start logging your HTTP requests and responses in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of dio5_log in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dio/dio.dart';
import 'package:dio5_log/dio5_log.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dio5 Log Example',
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  final Dio _dio = Dio();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Adding the logging interceptor to Dio
    _dio.interceptors.add(Dio5LogInterceptor());
  }

  Future<void> _makeRequest() async {
    try {
      // Making a GET request to a sample API
      final response = await _dio.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
      // Displaying the response in a dialog
      showDialog(
        context: context,
        builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
          title: Text('Response'),
          content: Text(response.data.toString()),
          actions: [
            TextButton(
              onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
              child: Text('Close'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      );
    } catch (e) {
      // Handling errors and displaying them
      showDialog(
        context: context,
        builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
          title: Text('Error'),
          content: Text(e.toString()),
          actions: [
            TextButton(
              onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
              child: Text('Close'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      );
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Dio5 Log Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _makeRequest,
          child: Text('Make API Request'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home page (MyHomePage).
// 3. In MyHomePage, we initialize Dio and add the Dio5LogInterceptor in initState.
// 4. When the user presses the "Make API Request" button, the _makeRequest method is called.
// 5. This method makes a GET request to a sample API and logs the request and response.
// 6. If the request is successful, the response data is displayed in a dialog.
// 7. If an error occurs, it is caught and displayed in a separate dialog.
