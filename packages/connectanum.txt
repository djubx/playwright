# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Connectanum

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the Connectanum package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the Connectanum package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  connectanum: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using Connectanum in Your Application

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your Flutter application.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:connectanum/connectanum.dart';
```

2. Initialize the Connectanum instance and set up the connection:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late Connectanum connectanum;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    connectanum = Connectanum();
    connectanum.connect('your_connection_string'); // Replace with your connection string
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    connectanum.disconnect();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Connectanum Example')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Connected to Connectanum!')),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize the Connectanum instance in the `initState` method and connect to a specified connection string. We also ensure to disconnect when the widget is disposed.

# Complete Example of Connectanum in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:connectanum/connectanum.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// MyApp is the root widget of the application
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: RealFlutter(), // Set RealFlutter as the home widget
    );
  }
}

// RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that manages the connection
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late Connectanum connectanum; // Declare Connectanum instance

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    connectanum = Connectanum(); // Initialize Connectanum
    connectanum.connect('your_connection_string'); // Connect using a connection string
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    connectanum.disconnect(); // Disconnect when the widget is disposed
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Connectanum Example')), // AppBar with title
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Connected to Connectanum!'), // Display connection status
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds the MaterialApp and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter initializes the Connectanum instance in initState.
// 4. The connect method is called with a connection string to establish a connection.
// 5. When the widget is disposed, the disconnect method is called to clean up the connection.
// 6. The UI displays a simple message indicating the connection status.
```
