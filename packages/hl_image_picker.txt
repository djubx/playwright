# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using hl_image_picker

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `hl_image_picker` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `hl_image_picker` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  hl_image_picker: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/hl_image_picker).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the required permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request permission for camera and photo library access:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to take photos.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to select images.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using hl_image_picker

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your Flutter application.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:hl_image_picker/hl_image_picker.dart';
```

2. Create a function to pick an image:

```dart
Future<void> pickImage() async {
  final result = await HLPImagePicker.pickImage();
  if (result != null) {
    // Handle the selected image
  }
}
```

3. Call this function from a button or any other widget in your UI.

With these steps, you can easily integrate the `hl_image_picker` package into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of hl_image_picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:hl_image_picker/hl_image_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Image Picker Example',
      home: ImagePickerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ImagePickerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ImagePickerScreenState createState() => _ImagePickerScreenState();
}

class _ImagePickerScreenState extends State<ImagePickerScreen> {
  // Variable to hold the selected image
  String? _imagePath;

  // Function to pick an image
  Future<void> _pickImage() async {
    // Call the image picker to select an image
    final result = await HLPImagePicker.pickImage();
    if (result != null) {
      // Update the state with the selected image path
      setState(() {
        _imagePath = result.path;
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Image Picker Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the selected image if available
            _imagePath != null
                ? Image.file(File(_imagePath!))
                : Text('No image selected.'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _pickImage, // Call the pick image function
              child: Text('Pick Image'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets ImagePickerScreen as the home.
// 3. ImagePickerScreen is a stateful widget that manages the selected image state.
// 4. The _pickImage function is defined to handle image selection using hl_image_picker.
// 5. When the user presses the "Pick Image" button, _pickImage is called.
// 6. If an image is selected, the state is updated, and the image is displayed on the screen.
// 7. If no image is selected, a message is shown indicating that no image is available.
```
