# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Dice Bear in Flutter

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started with the Dice Bear package, add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dice_bear: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install Packages

Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your `ios/Podfile` has the platform set to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the Dice Bear package:

```dart
import 'package:dice_bear/dice_bear.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using Dice Bear

You can now use the Dice Bear package to generate avatars. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create an avatar:

```dart
// Create an instance of the DiceBear class
final diceBear = DiceBear();
```

You can customize the avatar by specifying different styles and options. For example:

```dart
// Generate an avatar with specific options
final avatarUrl = diceBear.generateAvatar(
  style: 'avataaars', // Choose a style
  options: {
    'topType': 'LongHairBun',
    'facialHairType': 'BeardMedium',
    'clotheType': 'Hoodie',
  },
);
```

## Step 6: Displaying the Avatar

You can display the generated avatar in your Flutter widget tree using an `Image.network` widget:

```dart
Image.network(avatarUrl);
```

With these steps, you can easily integrate the Dice Bear package into your Flutter application and start generating unique avatars for your users.

# Complete Example: Dice Bear Avatar Generation

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dice_bear/dice_bear.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dice Bear Avatar Example',
      home: AvatarPage(),
    );
  }
}

class AvatarPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create an instance of the DiceBear class
    final diceBear = DiceBear();

    // Generate an avatar with specific options
    final avatarUrl = diceBear.generateAvatar(
      style: 'avataaars', // Choose a style
      options: {
        'topType': 'LongHairBun',
        'facialHairType': 'BeardMedium',
        'clotheType': 'Hoodie',
      },
    );

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Dice Bear Avatar Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        // Display the generated avatar
        child: Image.network(avatarUrl),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and home page.
// 3. AvatarPage is another StatelessWidget that generates an avatar using the DiceBear package.
// 4. Inside AvatarPage, an instance of DiceBear is created.
// 5. The generateAvatar method is called with specific style options to create a unique avatar URL.
// 6. The avatar is displayed in the center of the screen using an Image.network widget, which fetches the avatar from the generated URL.
