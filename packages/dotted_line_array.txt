# Tutorial: Using the Dotted Line Array Flutter Package
=====================================================

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up and using the `dotted_line_array` Flutter package in your project.

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

To add the `dotted_line_array` package to your project, you will need to add the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  dotted_line_array: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` in your terminal to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

To use the `dotted_line_array` package, you will need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:dotted_line_array/dotted_line_array.dart';
```

### Step 3: Create a Dotted Line Array

To create a dotted line array, you can use the `DottedLineArray` widget:

```dart
DottedLineArray(
  length: 10,
  spacing: 5,
  color: Colors.black,
)
```

This will create a horizontal dotted line array with 10 dots, spaced 5 pixels apart, and colored black.

### Platform-Specific Details

The `dotted_line_array` package works on both Android and iOS platforms. However, you may need to adjust the `length` and `spacing` properties to achieve the desired appearance on each platform.

### Required Configurations or Optimizations

There are no required configurations or optimizations for using the `dotted_line_array` package. However, you may want to consider adjusting the `length` and `spacing` properties to achieve the desired appearance in your application.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dotted_line_array/dotted_line_array.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dotted Line Array Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Dotted Line Array Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Create a horizontal dotted line array
            DottedLineArray(
              length: 10,
              spacing: 5,
              color: Colors.black,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Create a vertical dotted line array
            DottedLineArray(
              length: 10,
              spacing: 5,
              color: Colors.black,
              direction: Axis.vertical,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the application and is presented with a Material app.
// 2. The app displays a home page with an app bar and a body.
// 3. The body contains a column with two dotted line arrays.
// 4. The first dotted line array is horizontal and has 10 dots, spaced 5 pixels apart.
// 5. The second dotted line array is vertical and has 10 dots, spaced 5 pixels apart.
// 6. The user can view the dotted line arrays and adjust the length and spacing properties as needed.

// In summary, this code creates a Material app with a home page that displays two dotted line arrays.
// The user can view and adjust the dotted line arrays as needed.
