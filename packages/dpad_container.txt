# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using dpad_container

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `dpad_container` package, add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dpad_container: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:dpad_container/dpad_container.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Setup

To use the `dpad_container`, wrap your widget with `DpadContainer`. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
DpadContainer(
  onDpadDirection: (direction) {
    // Handle D-Pad direction input
    print('D-Pad direction: $direction');
  },
  child: YourChildWidget(),
);
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions for keyboard input. Typically, no additional configuration is required, but you may want to test on various devices to ensure compatibility.

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your app supports keyboard input. You may need to adjust your app's settings in Xcode to allow for external keyboard navigation.

## Step 4: Customizing the DpadContainer

You can customize the appearance and behavior of the `DpadContainer` by using various properties:

```dart
DpadContainer(
  onDpadDirection: (direction) {
    // Handle D-Pad direction input
  },
  child: YourChildWidget(),
  borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(10),
  padding: EdgeInsets.all(16),
);
```

### Example of Customization

```dart
DpadContainer(
  onDpadDirection: (direction) {
    // Handle D-Pad direction input
    print('D-Pad direction: $direction');
  },
  borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(20),
  padding: EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 20, vertical: 10),
  child: Container(
    color: Colors.blue,
    child: Center(child: Text('Press D-Pad Here')),
  ),
);
```

This example shows how to customize the `DpadContainer` with padding and rounded corners.

# Complete Example of dpad_container

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dpad_container/dpad_container.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dpad Container Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Dpad Container Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: DpadContainer(
            onDpadDirection: (direction) {
              // Handle D-Pad direction input
              print('D-Pad direction: $direction');
            },
            borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(20),
            padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
            child: Container(
              color: Colors.blue,
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'Press D-Pad Here',
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Dpad Container Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers a DpadContainer widget.
// 5. The DpadContainer listens for D-Pad direction inputs and prints the direction to the console.
// 6. The DpadContainer has a blue background and rounded corners, with a centered text widget that prompts the user to press the D-Pad.
// 7. When the user interacts with the DpadContainer, the onDpadDirection callback is triggered, allowing for custom navigation logic.
```
