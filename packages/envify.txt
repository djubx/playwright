# Overview of the envify Flutter Package

The `envify` package is a powerful tool for managing environment variables in Flutter applications. It allows developers to define and access environment-specific configurations easily, making it ideal for managing different settings for development, staging, and production environments. 

## When to Use `envify`
- **Environment Management**: When you need to switch between different configurations based on the environment (e.g., API endpoints, feature flags).
- **Sensitive Information**: To manage sensitive data like API keys without hardcoding them into your source code.
- **Build Configurations**: When you want to customize your app's behavior based on the build type.

## Key Features
- **Environment Variable Management**: Easily define and access environment variables.
- **Type Safety**: Provides type-safe access to environment variables.
- **Build-Time Configuration**: Variables are resolved at build time, ensuring that the correct values are used in the final build.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.

# Setting Up and Using the envify Package

## Installation
To get started with `envify`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  envify: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Configuration
1. **Create an Environment File**: Create a file named `.env` in the root of your Flutter project. This file will contain your environment variables. For example:

```
API_URL=https://api.example.com
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

2. **Generate the Environment Variables**: Run the following command in your terminal to generate the Dart code from your `.env` file:

```bash
flutter pub run envify
```

This command will create a file named `env.dart` in your `lib` directory, which contains the environment variables defined in your `.env` file.

## Platform-Specific Details
- **Android**: Ensure that your `.env` file is included in your `.gitignore` to prevent sensitive information from being pushed to version control.
- **iOS**: Similar to Android, make sure to manage your `.env` file carefully to avoid exposing sensitive data.

## Using the Package
To access the environment variables in your Flutter application, import the generated `env.dart` file:

```dart
import 'env.dart';
```

You can then access your variables like this:

```dart
String apiUrl = Env.API_URL;
String apiKey = Env.API_KEY;
```

# Complete Example of Using envify in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'env.dart'; // Import the generated environment variables

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Start the application with the RealFlutter widget
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Envify Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Envify Example App'), // Set the title of the app
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text('API URL: ${Env.API_URL}'), // Display the API URL
              Text('API Key: ${Env.API_KEY}'), // Display the API Key
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is returned, which sets up the app's title and home screen.
// 4. The home screen contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. The Center widget contains a Column that displays the API URL and API Key retrieved from the Env class.
// 6. The application will show the values defined in the .env file when run, demonstrating how to access environment variables.
```

In summary, the `envify` package provides a straightforward way to manage environment variables in Flutter applications. By following the setup and usage instructions, developers can easily switch between different configurations, ensuring that sensitive information is handled securely and efficiently.
