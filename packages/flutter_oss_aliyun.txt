# Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To use the `flutter_oss_aliyun` package, add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_oss_aliyun: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and add the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to upload images.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to take photos.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for video uploads.</string>
```

## Step 3: Initialize the Package

In your Dart code, import the package and initialize it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_oss_aliyun/flutter_oss_aliyun.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
  // Initialize the OSS client with your credentials
  RealFlutter.initializeOSS(
    accessKeyId: 'your_access_key_id',
    accessKeySecret: 'your_access_key_secret',
    endpoint: 'your_endpoint',
  );
}
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the package to upload and download files. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to upload a file:

```dart
void uploadFile(String filePath) async {
  try {
    String result = await RealFlutter.uploadFile(
      bucketName: 'your_bucket_name',
      filePath: filePath,
      objectKey: 'uploads/${DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch}.jpg',
    );
    print('File uploaded successfully: $result');
  } catch (e) {
    print('Error uploading file: $e');
  }
}
```

This function uploads a file to the specified bucket and prints the result.

# Complete Example of Using flutter_oss_aliyun

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_oss_aliyun/flutter_oss_aliyun.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
  // Initialize the OSS client with your credentials
  RealFlutter.initializeOSS(
    accessKeyId: 'your_access_key_id',
    accessKeySecret: 'your_access_key_secret',
    endpoint: 'your_endpoint',
  );
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'OSS Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  String _uploadResult = '';

  // Function to upload a file
  void uploadFile(String filePath) async {
    try {
      String result = await RealFlutter.uploadFile(
        bucketName: 'your_bucket_name',
        filePath: filePath,
        objectKey: 'uploads/${DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch}.jpg',
      );
      setState(() {
        _uploadResult = 'File uploaded successfully: $result';
      });
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        _uploadResult = 'Error uploading file: $e';
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('OSS Upload Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Call the upload function with a sample file path
                uploadFile('/path/to/your/file.jpg');
              },
              child: Text('Upload File'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(_uploadResult),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts by initializing the OSS client with the provided credentials.
// 2. The HomeScreen widget is displayed, which contains a button to upload a file.
// 3. When the button is pressed, the uploadFile function is called with a sample file path.
// 4. The uploadFile function attempts to upload the specified file to the OSS bucket.
// 5. If the upload is successful, the result is displayed on the screen; otherwise, an error message is shown.
