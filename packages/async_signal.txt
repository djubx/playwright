// This is the main entry point of the app.
// We create a `RealFlutter` widget and run it as the main app.

// Inside the `RealFlutter` widget, we create a signal and listen to it.
// When the signal is triggered, we update the UI with the received data.

// We use the `Signal` constructor to create a new signal.
// We then listen to the signal using the `listen` method.

// When the signal is triggered, we receive the data and update the UI.
// We use the `setState` method to update the UI.

// We create a button that triggers the signal when pressed.
// We use the `trigger` method to trigger the signal.

// This is the end of the main file example.

// In summary, this code creates a signal and listens to it.
// When the signal is triggered, it updates the UI with the received data.
// The signal can be triggered from anywhere in the code.
