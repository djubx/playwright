# Overview of the flutter_vap Package

The `flutter_vap` package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who need to implement video and audio processing capabilities in their applications. This package is particularly useful for applications that require real-time audio and video processing, such as video conferencing apps, live streaming platforms, or any multimedia applications.

## When to Use flutter_vap

- **Real-time Communication**: If you're building applications that require real-time audio and video communication, such as chat applications or video conferencing tools.
- **Media Processing**: For applications that need to process audio and video streams, such as filters, effects, or transformations.
- **Streaming Services**: If you're developing a streaming service that requires low-latency audio and video playback.

## Key Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Real-time Processing**: Capable of processing audio and video streams in real-time.
- **Customizable**: Offers a range of customizable options for audio and video settings.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that allows for easy integration into existing Flutter applications.

# Setting Up and Using flutter_vap

## Installation

To add the `flutter_vap` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_vap: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_vap).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys for microphone and camera usage:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio processing.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera for video processing.</string>
```

## Basic Usage

To use the `flutter_vap` package, you can start by initializing the `RealFlutter` class and setting up the audio and video streams. Below is a simple example of how to do this.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_vap/flutter_vap.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late VideoProcessor videoProcessor;
  late AudioProcessor audioProcessor;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize video and audio processors
    videoProcessor = VideoProcessor();
    audioProcessor = AudioProcessor();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the processors when the widget is removed
    videoProcessor.dispose();
    audioProcessor.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter VAP Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Start video processing
                videoProcessor.start();
              },
              child: Text('Start Video Processing'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Start audio processing
                audioProcessor.start();
              },
              child: Text('Start Audio Processing'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of flutter_vap

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_vap/flutter_vap.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late VideoProcessor videoProcessor; // Declare a VideoProcessor
  late AudioProcessor audioProcessor; // Declare an AudioProcessor

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize video and audio processors
    videoProcessor = VideoProcessor();
    audioProcessor = AudioProcessor();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the processors when the widget is removed
    videoProcessor.dispose();
    audioProcessor.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter VAP Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Start video processing
                videoProcessor.start();
              },
              child: Text('Start Video Processing'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Start audio processing
                audioProcessor.start();
              },
              child: Text('Start Audio Processing'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The RealFlutter widget is created, which initializes the video and audio processors.
// 2. When the widget is built, it displays two buttons: one for starting video processing and another for audio processing.
// 3. When the "Start Video Processing" button is pressed, the videoProcessor's start method is called, initiating video processing.
// 4. Similarly, pressing the "Start Audio Processing" button calls the audioProcessor's start method, initiating audio processing.
// 5. When the widget is disposed, both processors are properly disposed of to free up resources.
