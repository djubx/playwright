<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_notch_bottom_bar/animated_notch_bottom_bar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animated Notch Bottom Bar Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  // Current index of the selected item
  int _currentIndex = 0;

  // List of screens to navigate to
  final List<Widget> _screens = [
    Center(child: Text('Home Screen')),
    Center(child: Text('Search Screen')),
    Center(child: Text('Profile Screen')),
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: _screens[_currentIndex], // Display the selected screen
      bottomNavigationBar: AnimatedNotchBottomBar(
        // Define the items in the bottom navigation bar
        items: [
          BottomNavigationBarItem(
            icon: Icon(Icons.home),
            label: 'Home',
          ),
          BottomNavigationBarItem(
            icon: Icon(Icons.search),
            label: 'Search',
          ),
          BottomNavigationBarItem(
            icon: Icon(Icons.person),
            label: 'Profile',
          ),
        ],
        // Set the current index
        currentIndex: _currentIndex,
        // Handle item taps
        onTap: (index) {
          setState(() {
            _currentIndex = index; // Update the current index
          });
        },
        // Customize the notch
        notchColor: Colors.blue, // Color of the notch
        backgroundColor: Colors.white, // Background color of the bar
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code defines a simple Flutter application using the animated_notch_bottom_bar package.
// The main function initializes the app and sets the home screen to HomeScreen.
// The HomeScreen widget maintains the current index of the selected bottom navigation item.
// It uses a Scaffold to display the selected screen and the AnimatedNotchBottomBar at the bottom.
// The bottom navigation bar contains three items: Home, Search, and Profile.
// When an item is tapped, the current index is updated, and the corresponding screen is displayed.
// The notch color and background color of the bottom bar are customizable.
