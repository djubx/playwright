For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` if your app requires access to location services or other features that might be relevant to lunar date calculations.

## Usage
To use the `flutter_lunar_datetime_picker`, you can create a simple widget that invokes the date picker. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_lunar_datetime_picker/flutter_lunar_datetime_picker.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Lunar Date Picker Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              showLunarDatePicker(context);
            },
            child: Text('Select Lunar Date'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void showLunarDatePicker(BuildContext context) {
    showDialog(
      context: context,
      builder: (BuildContext context) {
        return LunarDatePicker(
          onDateSelected: (lunarDate) {
            // Handle the selected lunar date
            print('Selected Lunar Date: $lunarDate');
          },
        );
      },
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application with a button that opens the lunar date picker when pressed. The selected date is printed to the console.

With this setup, you can easily integrate the lunar date picker into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of flutter_lunar_datetime_picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_lunar_datetime_picker/flutter_lunar_datetime_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Lunar Date Picker Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // When the button is pressed, show the lunar date picker
              showLunarDatePicker(context);
            },
            child: Text('Select Lunar Date'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void showLunarDatePicker(BuildContext context) {
    // Show the lunar date picker dialog
    showDialog(
      context: context,
      builder: (BuildContext context) {
        return LunarDatePicker(
          onDateSelected: (lunarDate) {
            // Handle the selected lunar date
            print('Selected Lunar Date: $lunarDate');
            // You can also update the UI or state here based on the selected date
          },
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget with an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the showLunarDatePicker method is called.
// 5. This method displays a LunarDatePicker dialog.
// 6. When a date is selected, the onDateSelected callback is triggered, printing the selected lunar date to the console.
// 7. You can further enhance the app by updating the UI or storing the selected date for later use.
