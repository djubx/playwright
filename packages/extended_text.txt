# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Extended Text Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **extended_text** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  extended_text: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/extended_text).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the package as follows:

```dart
import 'package:extended_text/extended_text.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Extended Text Widget

You can now use the `ExtendedText` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
ExtendedText(
  'This is an example of extended text.',
  specialTextSpanBuilder: MySpecialTextSpanBuilder(),
)
```

In this example, `MySpecialTextSpanBuilder` is a custom class that you would define to handle special text formatting.

## Conclusion

With these steps, you should be able to set up and start using the **extended_text** package in your Flutter application. The package provides a robust solution for handling rich text, making it an excellent choice for developers looking to enhance their text rendering capabilities.

# Complete Example of Using the Extended Text Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:extended_text/extended_text.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Extended Text Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Extended Text Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ExtendedText(
            'This is an example of using the extended text package. '
            'You can select this text and copy it!',
            specialTextSpanBuilder: MySpecialTextSpanBuilder(),
            // The specialTextSpanBuilder allows for custom text formatting.
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Custom class to handle special text formatting
class MySpecialTextSpanBuilder extends SpecialTextSpanBuilder {
  @override
  SpecialTextSpan build(String text, {TextStyle? textStyle}) {
    // Here you can define how to handle special text spans
    return SpecialTextSpan(
      text: text,
      style: textStyle,
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, we use the ExtendedText widget to display text.
// 5. The ExtendedText widget allows for text selection and custom formatting through the specialTextSpanBuilder.
// 6. MySpecialTextSpanBuilder is a custom class that extends SpecialTextSpanBuilder, allowing for further customization of text rendering.
