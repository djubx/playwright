## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage

To use the widgets from the "my_widgets" package, import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:my_widgets/my_widgets.dart';
```

You can then start using the widgets in your Flutter application. For example, to use a custom button widget:

```dart
MyCustomButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // Handle button press
  },
  label: 'Click Me',
);
```

# Complete Example of Using "my_widgets"

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:my_widgets/my_widgets.dart'; // Importing the my_widgets package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the RealFlutter app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'My Widgets Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue, // Setting the primary color
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(), // Setting the home page
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('My Widgets Demo'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Using a custom button from my_widgets
            MyCustomButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action when button is pressed
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Button Pressed!')),
                );
              },
              label: 'Press Me', // Button label
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between widgets
            // Using a custom card widget from my_widgets
            MyCustomCard(
              title: 'Card Title',
              content: 'This is a custom card from my_widgets.',
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. MyHomePage is set as the home page of the app.
// 4. MyHomePage contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the button and card vertically.
// 6. MyCustomButton is displayed, which shows a SnackBar when pressed.
// 7. Below the button, a MyCustomCard is displayed with a title and content.
```
<!-- END_MAIN -->
```

### Summary of Application Flow
The application starts with the `main` function, which initializes the `RealFlutter` widget. This widget sets up a `MaterialApp` with a defined theme and a home page. The `MyHomePage` widget contains a `Scaffold` with an `AppBar` and a centered column layout. Inside this column, a custom button and a custom card are displayed. When the button is pressed, a SnackBar notification appears, demonstrating interactivity. This example showcases the ease of integrating and using the "my_widgets" package to create a functional and visually appealing Flutter application.
