# Complete Example of Using the Order Tracker Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:order_tracker/order_tracker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Order Tracker Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: OrderTrackerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class OrderTrackerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _OrderTrackerScreenState createState() => _OrderTrackerScreenState();
}

class _OrderTrackerScreenState extends State<OrderTrackerScreen> {
  // Sample order data
  final Order order = Order(
    id: '12345',
    status: OrderStatus.processing,
    history: [
      OrderHistory(status: OrderStatus.processing, timestamp: DateTime.now().subtract(Duration(hours: 2))),
      OrderHistory(status: OrderStatus.shipped, timestamp: DateTime.now().subtract(Duration(hours: 1))),
      OrderHistory(status: OrderStatus.delivered, timestamp: DateTime.now()),
    ],
  );

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Order Tracker'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: OrderTracker(
          order: order,
          onStatusChanged: (status) {
            // Handle status change
            print('Order status changed to: $status');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme, and sets OrderTrackerScreen as the home widget.
// 3. OrderTrackerScreen is a stateful widget that holds the order data.
// 4. The order data includes an ID, current status, and a history of status changes.
// 5. The build method of OrderTrackerScreen creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a centered OrderTracker widget.
// 6. The OrderTracker widget displays the order status and history, and triggers onStatusChanged when the status updates.
```
