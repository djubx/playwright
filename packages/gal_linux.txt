```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());

  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Create a new Linux distribution
  LinuxDistribution _distribution;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _distribution = LinuxDistribution(
      name: 'My Linux Distribution',
      version: '1.0.0',
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Real Flutter',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Real Flutter'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text(
                'Welcome to Real Flutter!',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () async {
                  // Deploy the Linux distribution
                  await _distribution.deploy();
                  print('Linux distribution deployed!');
                },
                child: Text('Deploy Linux Distribution'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a welcome screen.
// 2. The user clicks the "Deploy Linux Distribution" button.
// 3. The app creates a new Linux distribution using the `LinuxDistribution` class.
// 4. The app deploys the Linux distribution using the `deploy` method.
// 5. The app prints a success message to the console.

// Final summary: This code demonstrates how to create a custom Linux distribution and deploy it using the `gal_linux` package. The app uses the `LinuxDistribution` class to create a new distribution and the `deploy` method to deploy it.
