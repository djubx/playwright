# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using bs_flutter_alert

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `bs_flutter_alert` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  bs_flutter_alert: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:bs_flutter_alert/bs_flutter_alert.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

### Basic Usage

You can create a simple alert dialog using the `showAlert` method provided by the package. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

```dart
void showSimpleAlert(BuildContext context) {
  showAlert(
    context: context,
    title: 'Alert Title',
    message: 'This is a simple alert message.',
    buttonText: 'OK',
  );
}
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions if you are using features that require them. Typically, alerts do not require special permissions, but it's good to check for any additional features you might implement.

#### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your app's Info.plist file is configured correctly. Again, alerts generally do not require special configurations, but if you are using any media or location features, make sure to include the necessary keys.

## Step 4: Customizing Alerts

You can customize the alerts further by adding more parameters, such as custom buttons or styles. For example:

```dart
void showCustomAlert(BuildContext context) {
  showAlert(
    context: context,
    title: 'Custom Alert',
    message: 'This alert has custom buttons.',
    buttons: [
      AlertButton(
        text: 'Cancel',
        onPressed: () {
          Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the alert
        },
      ),
      AlertButton(
        text: 'Confirm',
        onPressed: () {
          // Handle confirmation action
          Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the alert
        },
      ),
    ],
  );
}
```

With these steps, you can easily set up and use the `bs_flutter_alert` package in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of bs_flutter_alert

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bs_flutter_alert/bs_flutter_alert.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'bs_flutter_alert Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('bs_flutter_alert Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Show a simple alert when the button is pressed
              showSimpleAlert(context);
            },
            child: Text('Show Alert'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void showSimpleAlert(BuildContext context) {
    // Display a simple alert dialog
    showAlert(
      context: context,
      title: 'Alert Title',
      message: 'This is a simple alert message.',
      buttonText: 'OK',
    );
  }

  void showCustomAlert(BuildContext context) {
    // Display a custom alert dialog with multiple buttons
    showAlert(
      context: context,
      title: 'Custom Alert',
      message: 'This alert has custom buttons.',
      buttons: [
        AlertButton(
          text: 'Cancel',
          onPressed: () {
            Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the alert
          },
        ),
        AlertButton(
          text: 'Confirm',
          onPressed: () {
            // Handle confirmation action
            Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the alert
          },
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'bs_flutter_alert Example'.
// 4. The body contains a Center widget with an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the showSimpleAlert method is called.
// 6. The showSimpleAlert method displays a simple alert dialog with a title, message, and an OK button.
// 7. The user can dismiss the alert by pressing the OK button, which closes the dialog.
```
