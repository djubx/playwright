# win_toast Flutter Package

The `win_toast` package is a Flutter plugin that allows developers to display toast notifications on Windows applications. Toast notifications are a great way to provide feedback to users without interrupting their workflow. This package is particularly useful for desktop applications built with Flutter, where user experience can be enhanced through non-intrusive notifications.

## When to Use

You might want to use the `win_toast` package in scenarios such as:
- Providing feedback after a user action (e.g., saving a file).
- Alerting users about background processes (e.g., downloads or uploads).
- Displaying notifications for events that require user attention without blocking the UI.

## Features

- **Customizable Toast Notifications**: You can customize the title, message, and duration of the toast notifications.
- **Rich Notifications**: Support for images and buttons to create more interactive notifications.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that integrates seamlessly with Flutter applications.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: While primarily designed for Windows, it can be adapted for use in other platforms with similar notification systems.

Overall, `win_toast` is a powerful tool for enhancing user interaction in Flutter desktop applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up win_toast

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `win_toast` package and how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To use the `win_toast` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  win_toast: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install the Package

Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Windows Configuration

1. Ensure that your Flutter project is set up for Windows development. You can check this by running:
   ```bash
   flutter config --enable-windows-desktop
   ```

2. You may need to enable toast notifications in your Windows application settings. This can usually be done in the `AppManifest.xml` file located in the `windows/runner` directory. Ensure that the `Toast` capability is enabled.

### iOS Configuration

Currently, the `win_toast` package is specifically designed for Windows applications. For iOS, you may want to look into other packages like `flutter_local_notifications` for similar functionality.

## Step 4: Using win_toast

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to display a toast notification.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:win_toast/win_toast.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Win Toast Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Win Toast Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Create a toast notification
              WinToast.showToast(
                title: 'Hello!',
                message: 'This is a toast notification.',
                duration: ToastDuration.short,
              );
            },
            child: Text('Show Toast'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, a toast notification will appear with a title and message.

Now you are ready to use the `win_toast` package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of win_toast

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:win_toast/win_toast.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Win Toast Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Win Toast Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Create a toast notification
              WinToast.showToast(
                title: 'Hello!',
                message: 'This is a toast notification.',
                duration: ToastDuration.short,
              );
            },
            child: Text('Show Toast'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Win Toast Example'.
// 4. In the body of the Scaffold, a Center widget is used to center the content.
// 5. An ElevatedButton is created, which, when pressed, triggers the onPressed callback.
// 6. Inside the onPressed callback, the WinToast.showToast() method is called to display a toast notification.
// 7. The toast notification has a title 'Hello!' and a message 'This is a toast notification.' with a short duration.
// 8. When the button is clicked, the toast appears, providing feedback to the user without interrupting their workflow.
