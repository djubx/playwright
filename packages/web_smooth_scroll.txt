# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `web_smooth_scroll`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `web_smooth_scroll` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  web_smooth_scroll: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/web_smooth_scroll).

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:web_smooth_scroll/web_smooth_scroll.dart';
```

## Step 3: Configuring for Android and iOS

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to enable certain settings in your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file to ensure smooth scrolling works correctly. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>UIRequiresPersistentWiFi</key>
<true/>
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

To implement smooth scrolling in your application, wrap your scrollable widget (like `ListView` or `SingleChildScrollView`) with `SmoothScroll` widget provided by the package. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
SmoothScroll(
  child: ListView.builder(
    itemCount: 100,
    itemBuilder: (context, index) {
      return ListTile(
        title: Text('Item $index'),
      );
    },
  ),
);
```

This will enable smooth scrolling for the `ListView` containing 100 items.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can easily integrate the `web_smooth_scroll` package into your Flutter web application, enhancing the user experience with smooth scrolling capabilities.

# Complete Example of Using `web_smooth_scroll`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:web_smooth_scroll/web_smooth_scroll.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Smooth Scroll Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Smooth Scroll Example'),
        ),
        body: SmoothScroll(
          // Wrapping the ListView with SmoothScroll for smooth scrolling
          child: ListView.builder(
            itemCount: 100, // Number of items in the list
            itemBuilder: (context, index) {
              return ListTile(
                title: Text('Item $index'), // Displaying item index
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Smooth Scroll Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is wrapped in a SmoothScroll widget, enabling smooth scrolling.
// 5. Inside the SmoothScroll, a ListView.builder is created to generate a list of 100 items.
// 6. Each item in the list is represented by a ListTile displaying its index.
// 7. When the user scrolls through the list, the smooth scrolling effect is applied, enhancing the user experience.
