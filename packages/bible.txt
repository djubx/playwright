# Setting Up the "bible" Flutter Package

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the "bible" package and how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Installation

To add the "bible" package to your Flutter project, follow these steps:

1. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file.
2. Add the following dependency:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     bible: ^latest_version
   ```

   Replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/bible).

3. Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
- Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS
- For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

## Using the Package

Once the package is installed, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to fetch and display a Bible verse.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

   ```dart
   import 'package:bible/bible.dart';
   ```

2. Initialize the package and fetch a verse:

   ```dart
   void fetchVerse() async {
       final bible = Bible();
       String verse = await bible.getVerse('John 3:16');
       print(verse);
   }
   ```

This setup will allow you to access Bible verses and display them in your application. Make sure to handle any exceptions or errors that may arise during the fetching process.

# Complete Example of Using the "bible" Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bible/bible.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Bible App',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: BibleHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class BibleHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _BibleHomePageState createState() => _BibleHomePageState();
}

class _BibleHomePageState extends State<BibleHomePage> {
  String _verse = "Press the button to fetch a verse";

  // Function to fetch a verse from the Bible
  void _fetchVerse() async {
    final bible = Bible(); // Initialize the Bible instance
    String verse = await bible.getVerse('John 3:16'); // Fetch the verse
    setState(() {
      _verse = verse; // Update the state with the fetched verse
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Bible Verse Fetcher'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              _verse, // Display the fetched verse
              textAlign: TextAlign.center,
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _fetchVerse, // Call the fetch function on button press
              child: Text('Get Verse'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme, and sets BibleHomePage as the home widget.
// 3. BibleHomePage is a stateful widget that maintains the current verse in its state.
// 4. The _fetchVerse function is defined to fetch a verse from the Bible when called.
// 5. When the button is pressed, _fetchVerse is triggered, fetching the verse and updating the state.
// 6. The fetched verse is displayed in the center of the screen, and the user can press the button to fetch a new verse.
```
