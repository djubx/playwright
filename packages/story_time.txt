# Complete Example of Using the Story Time Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:story_time/story_time.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Story Time Example',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: StoryPage(),
    );
  }
}

class StoryPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Story Time')),
      body: StoryTime(
        // Define the story segments
        stories: [
          StorySegment(
            title: 'Welcome to Story Time',
            content: 'This is the first segment of our story.',
            backgroundColor: Colors.blueAccent,
          ),
          StorySegment(
            title: 'The Journey Begins',
            content: 'Here we start our adventure!',
            backgroundColor: Colors.greenAccent,
          ),
          StorySegment(
            title: 'The End',
            content: 'Thank you for joining us!',
            backgroundColor: Colors.redAccent,
          ),
        ],
        // Customize navigation controls
        onNext: () {
          print('Next segment');
        },
        onPrevious: () {
          print('Previous segment');
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home of the MaterialApp is set to StoryPage, which contains the story content.
// 4. In StoryPage, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a body that uses the StoryTime widget.
// 5. The StoryTime widget takes a list of StorySegment objects, each representing a part of the story.
// 6. Each StorySegment has a title, content, and background color, which are displayed in the app.
// 7. Navigation controls are provided to move between story segments, with print statements for debugging.
