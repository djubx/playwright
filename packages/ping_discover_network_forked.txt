Here's a detailed technical blog on the "ping_discover_network_forked" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Description

The `ping_discover_network_forked` Flutter package is a powerful tool for network discovery and pinging devices on a local network. It allows developers to identify devices connected to the same network by sending ICMP echo requests (pings) and receiving responses. This package is particularly useful in applications that require network scanning, such as IoT applications, network management tools, or any app that needs to interact with devices on a local network.

## When to Use This Package

- **IoT Applications**: When building applications that need to discover and interact with IoT devices on a local network.
- **Network Management Tools**: For applications that monitor or manage network devices, this package can help identify active devices.
- **Local Network Utilities**: Any app that requires scanning the local network for available devices can benefit from this package.

## Features

- **Network Scanning**: Discover devices on the local network by sending ping requests.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: The package supports asynchronous operations, making it suitable for Flutter's reactive programming model.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS, allowing for a wide range of applications.

# Tutorial

## Setup Process

To use the `ping_discover_network_forked` package in your Flutter application, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     ping_discover_network_forked: ^latest_version
   ```

   Replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/ping_discover_network_forked).

2. **Install the Package**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to access the internet and network state. Add the following lines inside the `<manifest>` tag:

     ```xml
     <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
     <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
     ```

   - **iOS**: For iOS, you need to add the following permissions in your `Info.plist` file:

     ```xml
     <key>NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription</key>
     <string>This app requires access to the local network to discover devices.</string>
     ```

## Using the Package

Once the package is set up, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Here’s a simple example of how to use the `ping_discover_network_forked` package to discover devices on the local network.

1. **Import the Package**:

   ```dart
   import 'package:ping_discover_network_forked/ping_discover_network_forked.dart';
   ```

2. **Discover Devices**: You can create a method to discover devices on the network. Here’s a simple implementation:

   ```dart
   Future<void> discoverDevices() async {
     // Define the subnet to scan
     String subnet = '192.168.1'; // Change this to your local subnet
     List<NetworkAddress> devices = await NetworkUtils.discover(subnet);
     // Print discovered devices
     devices.forEach((device) {
       print('Discovered device: ${device.address}');
     });
   }
   ```

3. **Call the Method**: You can call this method from your UI, for example, in a button's `onPressed` callback.

By following these steps, you can successfully set up and use the `ping_discover_network_forked` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ping_discover_network_forked/ping_discover_network_forked.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Network Discovery',
      home: NetworkDiscoveryScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class NetworkDiscoveryScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _NetworkDiscoveryScreenState createState() => _NetworkDiscoveryScreenState();
}

class _NetworkDiscoveryScreenState extends State<NetworkDiscoveryScreen> {
  List<NetworkAddress> devices = []; // List to hold discovered devices

  // Method to discover devices on the local network
  Future<void> discoverDevices() async {
    String subnet = '192.168.1'; // Change this to your local subnet
    List<NetworkAddress> discoveredDevices = await NetworkUtils.discover(subnet);
    setState(() {
      devices = discoveredDevices; // Update the state with discovered devices
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Network Discovery'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: discoverDevices, // Call discoverDevices on button press
            child: Text('Discover Devices'),
          ),
          Expanded(
            child: ListView.builder(
              itemCount: devices.length, // Number of discovered devices
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text(devices[index].address), // Display device address
                );
              },
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (NetworkDiscoveryScreen).
// 3. NetworkDiscoveryScreen is a stateful widget that maintains a list of discovered devices.
// 4. When the "Discover Devices" button is pressed, the discoverDevices method is called.
// 5. discoverDevices sends ping requests to the specified subnet and updates the devices list.
// 6. The ListView displays the addresses of the discovered devices in real-time.
```
