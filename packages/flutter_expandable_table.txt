# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Flutter Expandable Table Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_expandable_table` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_expandable_table: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `flutter_expandable_table` in your app.

# Complete Example of Using Flutter Expandable Table

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_expandable_table/flutter_expandable_table.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Expandable Table Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Expandable Table Example'),
        ),
        body: ExpandableTableDemo(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class ExpandableTableDemo extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample data for the expandable table
    final List<Map<String, dynamic>> data = [
      {
        'name': 'Item 1',
        'details': 'Details about Item 1',
      },
      {
        'name': 'Item 2',
        'details': 'Details about Item 2',
      },
      {
        'name': 'Item 3',
        'details': 'Details about Item 3',
      },
    ];

    return ExpandableTable(
      columns: [
        // Define the columns of the table
        TableColumn(label: Text('Name')),
      ],
      rows: data.map((item) {
        return ExpandableTableRow(
          // Each row can be expanded
          header: Text(item['name']),
          expandedContent: Text(item['details']),
        );
      }).toList(),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold containing an AppBar and body.
// 3. The body contains the ExpandableTableDemo widget, which is responsible for displaying the expandable table.
// 4. Inside ExpandableTableDemo, we define a list of sample data with names and details.
// 5. The ExpandableTable widget is created with defined columns and rows.
// 6. Each row is represented by an ExpandableTableRow, which has a header and expandable content.
// 7. When a user taps on a row, it expands to show more details about the item.
```

// The above code demonstrates how to create a simple Flutter application using the `flutter_expandable_table` package. The application consists of an expandable table that displays a list of items. Each item can be expanded to reveal additional details, providing a clean and organized way to present data to users.
