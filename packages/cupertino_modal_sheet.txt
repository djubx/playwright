# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Cupertino Modal Sheet

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `cupertino_modal_sheet` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cupertino_modal_sheet: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:cupertino_modal_sheet/cupertino_modal_sheet.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Modal Sheet

You can use the `showCupertinoModalBottomSheet` function to display the modal sheet. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
void _showModalSheet(BuildContext context) {
  showCupertinoModalBottomSheet(
    context: context,
    builder: (context) => Container(
      height: 300,
      color: Colors.white,
      child: Center(
        child: Text('This is a Cupertino Modal Sheet'),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### iOS

On iOS, the modal sheet will slide up from the bottom of the screen, providing a smooth transition. Ensure that your app's UI follows the iOS design guidelines for a consistent user experience.

### Android

While the package is primarily designed for iOS, it can also be used on Android. However, consider using the standard `showModalBottomSheet` for Android to maintain platform consistency.

## Step 4: Configuration and Optimizations

- **Customizing the Modal Sheet**: You can customize the modal sheet's appearance by modifying the `Container` widget inside the builder function. Change the height, color, and add more widgets as needed.
- **Dismiss Behavior**: The modal sheet can be dismissed by swiping down, which is the default behavior. You can also programmatically dismiss it using the `Navigator.pop(context)` method.

By following these steps, you can successfully integrate the `cupertino_modal_sheet` package into your Flutter application and create a beautiful, functional modal sheet.

# Complete Example of Cupertino Modal Sheet

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cupertino_modal_sheet/cupertino_modal_sheet.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Cupertino Modal Sheet Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Cupertino Modal Sheet Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Call the function to show the modal sheet
            _showModalSheet(context);
          },
          child: Text('Show Modal Sheet'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void _showModalSheet(BuildContext context) {
    // Display the Cupertino modal bottom sheet
    showCupertinoModalBottomSheet(
      context: context,
      builder: (context) => Container(
        height: 300, // Set the height of the modal sheet
        color: Colors.white, // Background color of the modal sheet
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text(
              'This is a Cupertino Modal Sheet',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Dismiss the modal sheet when the button is pressed
                Navigator.pop(context);
              },
              child: Text('Close'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. HomeScreen contains a button that, when pressed, calls the _showModalSheet function.
// 4. The _showModalSheet function uses showCupertinoModalBottomSheet to display the modal.
// 5. The modal sheet contains a message and a button to close it.
// 6. Pressing the close button dismisses the modal sheet, returning the user to the HomeScreen.
