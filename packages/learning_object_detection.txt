# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Learning Object Detection Package

## Installation
To get started with the `learning_object_detection` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  learning_object_detection: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. **Permissions**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

2. **Minimum SDK Version**: Update your `build.gradle` file to set the minimum SDK version to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
1. **Permissions**: Add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file to request camera access:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the camera for object detection.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the photo library for object detection.</string>
```

2. **Deployment Target**: Ensure your deployment target is set to at least iOS 11.0 in your `Podfile`.

## Using the Package
Once the package is installed and configured, you can start using it in your Flutter application. The following sections will guide you through the implementation process.

# Complete Example of Using Learning Object Detection

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:learning_object_detection/learning_object_detection.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Object Detection Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: ObjectDetectionScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ObjectDetectionScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ObjectDetectionScreenState createState() => _ObjectDetectionScreenState();
}

class _ObjectDetectionScreenState extends State<ObjectDetectionScreen> {
  // Initialize the object detection model
  late ObjectDetector _objectDetector;
  List<DetectedObject> _detectedObjects = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Load the object detection model
    _objectDetector = ObjectDetector();
    _startDetection();
  }

  void _startDetection() async {
    // Start the camera stream and listen for frames
    await _objectDetector.startCamera();
    _objectDetector.detectObjects().listen((objects) {
      setState(() {
        _detectedObjects = objects; // Update the detected objects
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _objectDetector.stopCamera(); // Stop the camera when the widget is disposed
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Object Detection'),
      ),
      body: Stack(
        children: [
          // Display the camera preview
          CameraPreview(_objectDetector.cameraController),
          // Overlay detected objects
          ..._detectedObjects.map((object) {
            return Positioned(
              left: object.boundingBox.left,
              top: object.boundingBox.top,
              width: object.boundingBox.width,
              height: object.boundingBox.height,
              child: Container(
                decoration: BoxDecoration(
                  border: Border.all(color: Colors.red, width: 2),
                ),
                child: Text(object.label, style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white)),
              ),
            );
          }).toList(),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home screen as ObjectDetectionScreen.
// 3. In ObjectDetectionScreen, the object detection model is initialized in initState.
// 4. The _startDetection method starts the camera and listens for detected objects.
// 5. Detected objects are displayed on the screen with bounding boxes and labels.
// 6. When the widget is disposed, the camera is stopped to free up resources.
```
