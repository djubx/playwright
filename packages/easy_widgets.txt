class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Easy Widgets Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: EasyButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Action when button is pressed
          },
          child: Text('Press Me'),
        ),
      ),

# Complete Example of Easy Widgets in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:easy_widgets/easy_widgets.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Easy Widgets Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Easy Widgets Example'),
        ),
        body: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Using EasyButton from easy_widgets
            EasyButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action when button is pressed
                print('Button Pressed!');
              },
              child: Text('Press Me'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between widgets
            // Using EasyCard to create a card layout
            EasyCard(
              child: Padding(
                padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
                child: Text(
                  'This is an EasyCard widget.',
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body consists of a Column that centers its children vertically.
// 5. The first child is an EasyButton that prints a message when pressed.
// 6. The second child is an EasyCard that displays some text.
// 7. The EasyCard is padded for better visual spacing.
// 8. The layout is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
