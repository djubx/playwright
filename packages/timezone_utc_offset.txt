```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:timezone_utc_offset/timezone_utc_offset.dart';

void main() async {
  // Get the UTC offset
  final offset = await TimezoneUtcOffset.getUtcOffset();

  // Create a new Flutter app
  runApp(RealFlutter(offset));
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  final int offset;

  RealFlutter(this.offset);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Timezone UTC Offset Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Timezone UTC Offset Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(
            'Your timezone UTC offset is: $offset',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The main function is called, which gets the UTC offset using the TimezoneUtcOffset.getUtcOffset method.
// 2. The main function then creates a new Flutter app using the runApp method.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget is created, which takes the UTC offset as a parameter.
// 4. The RealFlutter widget builds a new MaterialApp, which displays the UTC offset in the center of the screen.
// 5. The user can then view the UTC offset, which is updated in real-time.

// In summary, this code flows by first getting the UTC offset, then creating a new Flutter app, and finally displaying the UTC offset in the center of the screen.
