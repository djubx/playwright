# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:form_builder_cupertino_fields/form_builder_cupertino_fields.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Cupertino Form Example',
      home: FormExample(),
    );
  }
}

class FormExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _FormExampleState createState() => _FormExampleState();
}

class _FormExampleState extends State<FormExample> {
  // Create a GlobalKey to manage the form state
  final _formKey = GlobalKey<FormBuilderState>();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Cupertino Form Example'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: FormBuilder(
          key: _formKey,
          child: Column(
            children: [
              // Cupertino Text Field
              FormBuilderCupertinoTextField(
                name: 'name',
                decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Name'),
                validator: FormBuilderValidators.compose([
                  FormBuilderValidators.required(context),
                  FormBuilderValidators.minLength(context, 3),
                ]),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 16.0),

              // Cupertino Email Field
              FormBuilderCupertinoTextField(
                name: 'email',
                decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Email'),
                validator: FormBuilderValidators.compose([
                  FormBuilderValidators.required(context),
                  FormBuilderValidators.email(context),
                ]),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 16.0),

              // Cupertino Dropdown Field
              FormBuilderCupertinoDropdown(
                name: 'gender',
                decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Gender'),
                items: ['Male', 'Female', 'Other']
                    .map((gender) => DropdownMenuItem(
                          value: gender,
                          child: Text(gender),
                        ))
                    .toList(),
                validator: FormBuilderValidators.required(context),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 16.0),

              // Submit Button
              CupertinoButton(
                color: CupertinoColors.activeBlue,
                child: Text('Submit'),
                onPressed: () {
                  // Validate the form
                  if (_formKey.currentState?.saveAndValidate() ?? false) {
                    // If the form is valid, display the values
                    final formData = _formKey.currentState?.value;
                    print('Form Data: $formData');
                  } else {
                    // If the form is invalid, show an error message
                    print('Validation failed');
                  }
                },
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets MyApp as the home widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a FormExample widget as the home.
// 3. FormExample is a StatefulWidget that manages the form state using a GlobalKey.
// 4. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a FormBuilder widget.
// 5. Inside the FormBuilder, various Cupertino form fields are created:
//    - A text field for the user's name with validation for required and minimum length.
//    - A text field for the user's email with validation for required and email format.
//    - A dropdown field for selecting gender with required validation.
// 6. A Cupertino button is provided to submit the form. When pressed, it validates the form.
// 7. If the form is valid, the form data is printed to the console; otherwise, an error message is shown.
