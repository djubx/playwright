## Setup Process

To use the `radio_group_v2` package in your Flutter project, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `radio_group_v2` dependency:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     radio_group_v2: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21.
   - **iOS**: No additional configuration is required for iOS, but ensure you have the latest version of Xcode.

## Using the Package

To use the `radio_group_v2` package, you can follow this simple example:

1. **Import the Package**:

   ```dart
   import 'package:radio_group_v2/radio_group_v2.dart';
   ```

2. **Create a Stateful Widget**: This allows you to manage the state of the selected radio button.

   ```dart
   class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
     @override
     _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
   }

   class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
     String? selectedValue;

     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return Scaffold(
         appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Radio Group Example')),
         body: RadioGroup<String>.builder(
           groupValue: selectedValue,
           onChanged: (value) => setState(() => selectedValue = value),
           items: ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3'],
           itemBuilder: (item) => RadioButtonBuilder(
             item,
           ),
         ),
       );
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Run Your App**: Use `flutter run` to start your application and see the radio buttons in action.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:radio_group_v2/radio_group_v2.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Radio Group Example',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to hold the selected radio button value
  String? selectedValue;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Radio Group Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: RadioGroup<String>.builder(
          // Set the current selected value
          groupValue: selectedValue,
          // Update the state when a radio button is selected
          onChanged: (value) => setState(() => selectedValue = value),
          // List of options for the radio buttons
          items: ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3'],
          // Builder for each radio button
          itemBuilder: (item) => RadioButtonBuilder(
            item,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme, and specifies RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the selected radio button.
// 4. In the build method, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a body containing a RadioGroup.
// 5. The RadioGroup is configured with a list of options and a callback to update the selected value.
// 6. When a user selects a radio button, the onChanged callback updates the selectedValue state, causing the UI to rebuild and reflect the new selection.
