### Tutorial

#### Installation

To get started with the `remove_background` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  remove_background: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/remove_background).

#### Platform-Specific Configuration

**For Android:**
1. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

**For iOS:**
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following permissions to allow access to the photo library:
   ```xml
   <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your photo library to remove backgrounds from images.</string>
   ```

#### Basic Usage

To use the `remove_background` package, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:
   ```dart
   import 'package:remove_background/remove_background.dart';
   ```

2. Use the `RemoveBackground` class to remove the background from an image. Hereâ€™s a simple example:
   ```dart
   final result = await RemoveBackground.removeBackground(
       image: yourImageFile,
       apiKey: 'your_api_key',
   );
   ```

Make sure to replace `yourImageFile` with the image you want to process and `your_api_key` with your API key from the service provider.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:remove_background/remove_background.dart';
import 'dart:io';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Remove Background Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomePageState createState() => _HomePageState();
}

class _HomePageState extends State<HomePage> {
  File? _image; // Variable to hold the selected image
  File? _resultImage; // Variable to hold the processed image

  // Function to pick an image from the gallery
  Future<void> _pickImage() async {
    // Code to pick an image from the gallery
    // This is where you would implement image picking logic
  }

  // Function to remove the background from the selected image
  Future<void> _removeBackground() async {
    if (_image != null) {
      // Call the removeBackground method from the package
      final result = await RemoveBackground.removeBackground(
        image: _image!,
        apiKey: 'your_api_key', // Replace with your actual API key
      );

      // Save the result image
      setState(() {
        _resultImage = result; // Update the state with the processed image
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Remove Background Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the original image if available
            _image != null
                ? Image.file(_image!)
                : Text('No image selected.'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Display the processed image if available
            _resultImage != null
                ? Image.file(_resultImage!)
                : Text('No background removed.'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _pickImage, // Trigger image picking
              child: Text('Pick Image'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _removeBackground, // Trigger background removal
              child: Text('Remove Background'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a HomePage as its home.
// 3. The HomePage contains state management to handle image selection and background removal.
// 4. The user can pick an image from the gallery, which updates the _image variable.
// 5. When the user clicks the "Remove Background" button, the _removeBackground function is called.
// 6. This function uses the removeBackground method from the package to process the image.
// 7. The processed image is then displayed on the screen if available.
```
