# Tutorial: Setting Up flutter_stripe_web

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_stripe_web` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter web application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

First, add the `flutter_stripe_web` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_stripe_web: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Configure Stripe

You need to set up your Stripe account and obtain your API keys. Follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register) and create an account.
2. Navigate to the Developers section to find your API keys.
3. Use the **Publishable Key** in your application.

## Step 3: Initialize Stripe

In your main application file, initialize Stripe with your publishable key:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_stripe_web/flutter_stripe_web.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  Stripe.publishableKey = 'your_publishable_key';
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 4: Create Payment Method

You can create a payment method using the `Stripe` class. Here’s an example of how to create a payment method:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_stripe_web/flutter_stripe_web.dart';

Future<void> createPaymentMethod() async {
  try {
    final paymentMethod = await Stripe.instance.createPaymentMethod(
      PaymentMethodParams.card(
        billingDetails: BillingDetails(
          email: 'email@example.com',
          phone: '+1234567890',
        ),
      ),
    );
    // Handle the payment method
  } catch (e) {
    // Handle error
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Handle Payments

To handle payments, you can use the `confirmPayment` method. Here’s how you can do it:

```dart
Future<void> confirmPayment(String paymentMethodId) async {
  try {
    final paymentIntent = await Stripe.instance.confirmPayment(
      paymentIntentClientSecret: 'your_payment_intent_client_secret',
      data: PaymentIntentParams(
        paymentMethodId: paymentMethodId,
      ),
    );
    // Handle successful payment
  } catch (e) {
    // Handle error
  }
}
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### For Web

- Ensure that your web application is served over HTTPS, as Stripe requires secure connections for payment processing.

### For Android and iOS

- While this package is primarily for web, if you plan to support mobile platforms, you should also include the `flutter_stripe` package for native payment processing.

## Conclusion

You have now set up the `flutter_stripe_web` package in your Flutter web application. You can create payment methods and handle payments securely using Stripe's API.

# Complete Example of flutter_stripe_web

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_stripe_web/flutter_stripe_web.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  // Initialize Stripe with your publishable key
  Stripe.publishableKey = 'your_publishable_key';
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Stripe Web Example',
      home: PaymentPage(),
    );
  }
}

class PaymentPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PaymentPageState createState() => _PaymentPageState();
}

class _PaymentPageState extends State<PaymentPage> {
  String? _paymentMethodId;

  // Function to create a payment method
  Future<void> _createPaymentMethod() async {
    try {
      final paymentMethod = await Stripe.instance.createPaymentMethod(
        PaymentMethodParams.card(
          billingDetails: BillingDetails(
            email: 'email@example.com',
            phone: '+1234567890',
          ),
        ),
      );
      setState(() {
        _paymentMethodId = paymentMethod.id; // Store the payment method ID
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle error
      print('Error creating payment method: $e');
    }
  }

  // Function to confirm the payment
  Future<void> _confirmPayment() async {
    if (_paymentMethodId == null) return; // Ensure payment method is created
    try {
      final paymentIntent = await Stripe.instance.confirmPayment(
        paymentIntentClientSecret: 'your_payment_intent_client_secret',
        data: PaymentIntentParams(
          paymentMethodId: _paymentMethodId!,
        ),
      );
      // Handle successful payment
      print('Payment successful: ${paymentIntent.id}');
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle error
      print('Error confirming payment: $e');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Stripe Payment')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _createPaymentMethod,
              child: Text('Create Payment Method'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _confirmPayment,
              child: Text('Confirm Payment'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts by initializing Stripe with the publishable key.
// 2. The main widget is `RealFlutter`, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. The `PaymentPage` widget contains two buttons: one for creating a payment method and another for confirming the payment.
// 4. When the "Create Payment Method" button is pressed, it calls `_createPaymentMethod`, which creates a payment method and stores its ID.
// 5. When the "Confirm Payment" button is pressed, it calls `_confirmPayment`, which confirms the payment using the stored payment method ID.
// 6. The app handles errors gracefully and prints messages to the console for debugging.
```
