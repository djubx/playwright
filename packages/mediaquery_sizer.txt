# MediaQuery Sizer Flutter Package

The **mediaquery_sizer** package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that simplifies responsive design by providing a way to size widgets based on the screen dimensions. This package allows developers to create layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the **mediaquery_sizer** package when:
- You are developing applications that need to support multiple screen sizes, such as tablets and smartphones.
- You want to create a responsive UI that adjusts dynamically to changes in screen orientation.
- You need a straightforward way to manage sizes and paddings without hardcoding values.

## Features

- **Responsive Sizing**: Easily set widget sizes based on the screen width and height.
- **Orientation Awareness**: Automatically adjust layouts based on the device's orientation (portrait or landscape).
- **Customizable Breakpoints**: Define your own breakpoints for different screen sizes to fine-tune the responsiveness of your app.

By leveraging the **mediaquery_sizer** package, developers can enhance the usability and aesthetics of their Flutter applications, making them more adaptable to various devices.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using MediaQuery Sizer

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **mediaquery_sizer** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  mediaquery_sizer: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:mediaquery_sizer/mediaquery_sizer.dart';
```

## Step 3: Wrapping Your App

To use the features of **mediaquery_sizer**, wrap your main application widget with `MediaQuerySizer`. This will allow you to access the responsive sizing features throughout your app.

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(
    MediaQuerySizer(
      child: MyApp(),
    ),
  );
}
```

## Step 4: Using MediaQuery Sizer in Your Widgets

You can now use the `MediaQuerySizer` methods to set sizes for your widgets. Hereâ€™s an example of how to use it:

```dart
Container(
  width: MediaQuerySizer.width(50), // 50% of the screen width
  height: MediaQuerySizer.height(30), // 30% of the screen height
  child: Text('Responsive Text'),
);
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Optimizations

- Use the `MediaQuerySizer` methods judiciously to avoid performance issues.
- Test your application on various devices to ensure that the responsive design works as expected.

With these steps, you are now ready to implement responsive designs in your Flutter applications using the **mediaquery_sizer** package.

# Complete Example of MediaQuery Sizer

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mediaquery_sizer/mediaquery_sizer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    MediaQuerySizer(
      child: MyApp(),
    ),
  );
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'MediaQuery Sizer Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('MediaQuery Sizer Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Using MediaQuerySizer to set width and height
            Container(
              width: MediaQuerySizer.width(80), // 80% of screen width
              height: MediaQuerySizer.height(20), // 20% of screen height
              color: Colors.blue,
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  '80% Width, 20% Height',
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
                ),
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between widgets
            // Another example with different sizing
            Container(
              width: MediaQuerySizer.width(60), // 60% of screen width
              height: MediaQuerySizer.height(15), // 15% of screen height
              color: Colors.green,
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  '60% Width, 15% Height',
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and wraps it with MediaQuerySizer.
// 2. MyApp is the root widget that sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. HomeScreen is the main screen of the app, containing a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to stack two containers vertically.
// 5. Each container uses MediaQuerySizer to set its width and height based on the screen size, ensuring responsiveness.
// 6. The first container takes 80% of the screen width and 20% of the height, while the second takes 60% width and 15% height.
// 7. The text inside each container is centered and styled for visibility.
```
