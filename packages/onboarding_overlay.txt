# Tutorial: Setting Up the Onboarding Overlay Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `onboarding_overlay` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `onboarding_overlay` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  onboarding_overlay: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to configure your app's Info.plist file. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add any required permissions or configurations specific to your app's needs.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's implement it in our Flutter application. The following steps outline how to create an onboarding overlay.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:onboarding_overlay/onboarding_overlay.dart';
```

2. Create a list of onboarding steps, each containing a title, description, and target widget.

3. Initialize the onboarding overlay in your main widget.

4. Trigger the onboarding overlay when the app starts or when a specific action occurs.

By following these steps, you can effectively implement the onboarding overlay in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Onboarding Overlay

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:onboarding_overlay/onboarding_overlay.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Onboarding Overlay Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Trigger the onboarding overlay when the button is pressed
            showOnboarding(context);
          },
          child: Text('Start Onboarding'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void showOnboarding(BuildContext context) {
    // Define the onboarding steps
    final onboardingSteps = [
      OnboardingStep(
        title: 'Welcome to RealFlutter!',
        description: 'This is your first step in the app.',
        targetWidget: Container(), // Target widget can be any widget
      ),
      OnboardingStep(
        title: 'Explore Features',
        description: 'Discover the amazing features we offer.',
        targetWidget: Container(), // Target widget can be any widget
      ),
      OnboardingStep(
        title: 'Get Started',
        description: 'Let\'s get started with your journey!',
        targetWidget: Container(), // Target widget can be any widget
      ),
    ];

    // Show the onboarding overlay
    OnboardingOverlay(
      steps: onboardingSteps,
      onFinish: () {
        // Action to perform when onboarding is finished
        Navigator.of(context).pop();
      },
    ).show(context);
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds the MaterialApp with a HomeScreen.
// 3. The HomeScreen contains a button that, when pressed, triggers the onboarding overlay.
// 4. The showOnboarding method defines the onboarding steps and displays the overlay.
// 5. Each onboarding step includes a title, description, and a target widget.
// 6. When the onboarding is finished, the onFinish callback is executed, allowing for any final actions.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the `onboarding_overlay` package. The application consists of a home screen with a button that triggers the onboarding overlay. Each step of the onboarding process is defined in the `showOnboarding` method, showcasing how to guide users through the app's features effectively.

### Summary of Application Flow
- The app starts with the `main` function, which initializes the `RealFlutter` widget.
- The `RealFlutter` widget sets up a `MaterialApp` with a `HomeScreen`.
- The `HomeScreen` displays a button that, when pressed, calls the `showOnboarding` method.
- The `showOnboarding` method creates a list of onboarding steps and displays the onboarding overlay.
- Each step provides a title and description, guiding the user through the app.
- Upon completion of the onboarding, the `onFinish` callback is executed, allowing for any necessary actions.

This structured approach ensures that users have a clear understanding of the app's functionalities, enhancing their overall experience.
