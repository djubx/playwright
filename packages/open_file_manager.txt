# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Open File Manager

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **open_file_manager** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **open_file_manager** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  open_file_manager: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/open_file_manager).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file. Add the following lines inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file to request permission for accessing files:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to open files.</string>
<key>NSDocumentsFolderUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your documents to open files.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to open a file using the **open_file_manager** package.

# Complete Example: Flutter Application Using Open File Manager

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:open_file_manager/open_file_manager.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Open File Manager Example',
      home: FileManagerHome(),
    );
  }
}

class FileManagerHome extends StatelessWidget {
  // Function to open a file
  void _openFile(String filePath) async {
    // Use the open_file_manager package to open the file
    final result = await OpenFileManager.open(filePath);
    // Check the result of the file opening
    if (result != null) {
      // Display a message if the file could not be opened
      print('Could not open file: $result');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Open File Manager Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Specify the path of the file to be opened
            String filePath = '/path/to/your/file.pdf'; // Change this to a valid file path
            _openFile(filePath); // Call the function to open the file
          },
          child: Text('Open File'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home page (FileManagerHome).
// 3. The FileManagerHome widget contains a button that, when pressed, triggers the _openFile function.
// 4. The _openFile function attempts to open a specified file using the OpenFileManager package.
// 5. If the file cannot be opened, an error message is printed to the console.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application that demonstrates how to use the **open_file_manager** package. The application consists of a button that, when pressed, attempts to open a specified file. The flow of the application is straightforward, allowing users to easily manage and open files on their devices.

### Final Summary

The **open_file_manager** package provides a robust solution for file management in Flutter applications. By following the setup and usage instructions outlined in this blog, developers can integrate file opening capabilities into their apps, enhancing user experience and functionality. The provided example serves as a foundation for building more complex file management features in your Flutter applications.
