# Timer Builder Flutter Package

The `timer_builder` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that simplifies the process of creating and managing timers in your applications. It provides a widget that rebuilds itself at specified intervals, allowing you to create dynamic and responsive UIs that react to time changes without the need for manual state management.

## When to Use `timer_builder`

You might consider using the `timer_builder` package in scenarios such as:
- **Countdown Timers**: For applications that require countdowns, such as quizzes or auctions.
- **Real-time Updates**: For displaying real-time data, like stock prices or sports scores, where the UI needs to refresh at regular intervals.
- **Animations**: To create animations that depend on time, such as fading effects or moving objects.

## Features
- **Customizable Intervals**: You can specify how often the widget should rebuild.
- **Flexible Builder**: The builder function allows you to define how the widget should look based on the current timer state.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate into existing Flutter applications with minimal setup.

Overall, the `timer_builder` package is an excellent choice for any Flutter application that requires time-based updates or animations.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Timer Builder

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `timer_builder` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  timer_builder: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the `timer_builder` package:

```dart
import 'package:timer_builder/timer_builder.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using Timer Builder

You can now use the `TimerBuilder` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a countdown timer:

```dart
TimerBuilder.periodic(
  Duration(seconds: 1), // Rebuild every second
  builder: (context, time) {
    return Text(
      '${time.second}', // Display the current second
      style: TextStyle(fontSize: 48),
    );
  },
);
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid compatibility issues.

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

#### iOS
For iOS, make sure your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Optimizations

- **Performance**: Use `TimerBuilder` judiciously, as frequent rebuilds can impact performance. Consider using longer intervals for less frequent updates.
- **State Management**: If your timer affects other parts of your UI, consider using state management solutions like Provider or Riverpod to manage the state more effectively.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the `timer_builder` package into your Flutter application seamlessly.

# Complete Example of Timer Builder

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:timer_builder/timer_builder.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Timer Builder Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Timer Builder Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: TimerBuilder.periodic(
            Duration(seconds: 1), // Set the timer to rebuild every second
            builder: (context, time) {
              // This function is called every second
              return Column(
                mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
                children: [
                  Text(
                    'Current Second:',
                    style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
                  ),
                  Text(
                    '${time.second}', // Display the current second
                    style: TextStyle(fontSize: 48),
                  ),
                ],
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'Timer Builder Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 5. The TimerBuilder widget is used to rebuild its child every second.
// 6. The builder function receives the current time and updates the UI to display the current second.
// 7. The Text widgets display static text and the dynamic current second, updating every second.
