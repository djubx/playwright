# Auto Resize Image Flutter Package

The `auto_resize_image` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to manage image sizes dynamically. This package automatically resizes images to fit within specified dimensions while maintaining their aspect ratio. It is particularly useful in scenarios where images need to adapt to different screen sizes or orientations, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing user interface.

## When to Use This Package
- **Responsive Design**: When building applications that need to look good on various screen sizes.
- **Dynamic Content**: For apps that display images from user-generated content or external sources where image sizes may vary.
- **Performance Optimization**: To reduce the memory footprint by loading appropriately sized images.

## Features
- **Automatic Resizing**: Automatically adjusts the image size based on the container dimensions.
- **Aspect Ratio Maintenance**: Preserves the original aspect ratio of images during resizing.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that integrates seamlessly with existing Flutter widgets.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Auto Resize Image

## Installation
To use the `auto_resize_image` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  auto_resize_image: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if you are loading images from the network. You may need to add:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Using the Package
To use the `auto_resize_image` package, you can wrap your image widget with `AutoResizeImage`. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:auto_resize_image/auto_resize_image.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Auto Resize Image Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: AutoResizeImage(
          image: NetworkImage('https://example.com/image.jpg'),
          width: 300, // Desired width
          height: 200, // Desired height
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `AutoResizeImage` widget takes a `NetworkImage` and resizes it to fit within the specified width and height while maintaining the aspect ratio.

# Complete Example of Auto Resize Image

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:auto_resize_image/auto_resize_image.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Auto Resize Image Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Auto Resize Image Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        // Centering the AutoResizeImage widget
        child: AutoResizeImage(
          image: NetworkImage('https://example.com/image.jpg'), // Image from the network
          width: 300, // Setting the desired width
          height: 200, // Setting the desired height
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, AutoResizeImage is used to display an image from the network.
// 5. The image is resized to fit within the specified width and height while maintaining its aspect ratio.
