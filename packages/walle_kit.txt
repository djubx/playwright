// The app starts by creating a `MaterialApp` widget with a `MyHomePage` widget as its home page.
// The `MyHomePage` widget creates a `Walle` object with an animation that animates the opacity of a `Text` widget.
// The `Walle` object is then passed to a `WalleKit` widget, which is used to animate the `Text` widget.
// The `WalleKit` widget is then placed inside a `Scaffold` widget with an `AppBar` and a `Center` widget.
// The `Center` widget is used to center the `WalleKit` widget horizontally and vertically.
