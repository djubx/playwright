# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Google My Business Package

## Installation
To use the `google_my_business` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  google_my_business: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/google_my_business).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. **Add Permissions**: Open `AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

2. **Google API Key**: Ensure you have a valid Google API key with access to the Google My Business API. You can obtain this from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

### iOS
1. **Add Permissions**: Open `Info.plist` and add the following:
   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. **Google API Key**: Similar to Android, ensure you have a valid Google API key.

## Usage
After setting up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to authenticate and fetch business locations.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:google_my_business/google_my_business.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Google My Business Example')),
        body: BusinessManagement(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class BusinessManagement extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _BusinessManagementState createState() => _BusinessManagementState();
}

class _BusinessManagementState extends State<BusinessManagement> {
  List<Location> locations = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _fetchLocations();
  }

  Future<void> _fetchLocations() async {
    // Authenticate the user
    final auth = await GoogleMyBusiness.authenticate();
    if (auth != null) {
      // Fetch business locations
      final fetchedLocations = await GoogleMyBusiness.getLocations(auth);
      setState(() {
        locations = fetchedLocations;
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ListView.builder(
      itemCount: locations.length,
      itemBuilder: (context, index) {
        return ListTile(
          title: Text(locations[index].name),
          subtitle: Text(locations[index].address),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Google My Business Integration

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:google_my_business/google_my_business.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Google My Business Example')),
        body: BusinessManagement(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class BusinessManagement extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _BusinessManagementState createState() => _BusinessManagementState();
}

class _BusinessManagementState extends State<BusinessManagement> {
  List<Location> locations = []; // List to hold business locations

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _fetchLocations(); // Fetch locations when the widget is initialized
  }

  Future<void> _fetchLocations() async {
    // Authenticate the user with Google My Business
    final auth = await GoogleMyBusiness.authenticate();
    if (auth != null) {
      // Fetch business locations using the authenticated user
      final fetchedLocations = await GoogleMyBusiness.getLocations(auth);
      setState(() {
        locations = fetchedLocations; // Update the state with fetched locations
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ListView.builder(
      itemCount: locations.length, // Number of locations to display
      itemBuilder: (context, index) {
        return ListTile(
          title: Text(locations[index].name), // Display location name
          subtitle: Text(locations[index].address), // Display location address
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The BusinessManagement widget is created, which is responsible for managing business locations.
// 3. In the initState method, _fetchLocations is called to retrieve the business locations.
// 4. The _fetchLocations method authenticates the user and fetches the locations using the Google My Business API.
// 5. The fetched locations are stored in the locations list, and the UI is updated using setState.
// 6. The build method constructs a ListView to display the names and addresses of the business locations.
