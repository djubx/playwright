# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `led_bulb_indicator`

## Installation
To use the `led_bulb_indicator` package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  led_bulb_indicator: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package, which you can find on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/led_bulb_indicator).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, no additional configuration is typically required. Just ensure that your project is set up to support the latest iOS versions.

## Using the Package
To use the `led_bulb_indicator` in your Flutter application, you can import the package and create an instance of the LED bulb indicator widget. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:led_bulb_indicator/led_bulb_indicator.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('LED Bulb Indicator Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: LedBulbIndicator(
            size: 100.0, // Size of the LED bulb
            color: Colors.green, // Color of the LED bulb
            isOn: true, // State of the LED bulb
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays a green LED bulb indicator in the center of the screen. The `isOn` property controls whether the bulb is lit or not.

With these steps, you can easily integrate the `led_bulb_indicator` package into your Flutter application and customize it to fit your needs.

# Complete Example of `led_bulb_indicator`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:led_bulb_indicator/led_bulb_indicator.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // State variable to control the LED bulb
  bool _isBulbOn = false;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('LED Bulb Indicator Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // LED Bulb Indicator
              LedBulbIndicator(
                size: 100.0, // Size of the LED bulb
                color: _isBulbOn ? Colors.green : Colors.red, // Change color based on state
                isOn: _isBulbOn, // Control the state of the LED bulb
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between the bulb and button
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Toggle the state of the LED bulb
                  setState(() {
                    _isBulbOn = !_isBulbOn; // Switch the state
                  });
                },
                child: Text(_isBulbOn ? 'Turn Off' : 'Turn On'), // Button text based on state
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the LED bulb.
// 3. The _isBulbOn variable determines whether the LED bulb is on or off.
// 4. The build method constructs the UI, including the LED bulb indicator and a button.
// 5. The LED bulb's color changes based on the _isBulbOn state (green if on, red if off).
// 6. When the button is pressed, the state is toggled, and the UI updates accordingly.
