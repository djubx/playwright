# Setting Up and Using `flutter_settings_ui`

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up and using the `flutter_settings_ui` package in a Flutter application. We will cover platform-specific configurations for both Android and iOS.

## Setup

1. **Add Dependency**

   Add the `flutter_settings_ui` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     flutter_settings_ui: ^0.7.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**

   Run the following command to install the new package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

- Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

  ```gradle
  android {
      defaultConfig {
          minSdkVersion 21
      }
  }
  ```

### iOS

- Make sure your iOS deployment target is set to 11.0 or higher in your `ios/Podfile`:

  ```ruby
  platform :ios, '11.0'
  ```

## Using the Package

To use the `flutter_settings_ui` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_settings_ui/flutter_settings_ui.dart';
```

You can then create a settings screen using the `SettingsList` widget, which contains `SettingsSection` and `SettingsTile` widgets to define individual settings.

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Settings UI Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: SettingsScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class SettingsScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Settings'),
      ),
      body: SettingsList(
        sections: [
          SettingsSection(
            title: Text('General'),
            tiles: <SettingsTile>[
              SettingsTile.navigation(

                title: Text('Language'),
                value: Text('English'),
                onPressed: (context) {
                  // Handle language change
                },
              ),
              SettingsTile.switchTile(
                onToggle: (value) {
                  // Handle dark mode toggle
                },
                initialValue: false,
                leading: Icon(Icons.dark_mode),
                title: Text('Dark Mode'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
          SettingsSection(
            title: Text('Account'),
            tiles: <SettingsTile>[
              SettingsTile.navigation(
                leading: Icon(Icons.lock),
                title: Text('Change Password'),
                onPressed: (context) {
                  // Handle password change
                },
              ),
              SettingsTile.navigation(
                leading: Icon(Icons.exit_to_app),
                title: Text('Sign Out'),
                onPressed: (context) {
                  // Handle sign out
                },
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The `main` function initializes the app by running `RealFlutter`, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. `RealFlutter` sets up a MaterialApp with a home screen of `SettingsScreen`.
// 3. `SettingsScreen` is a StatelessWidget that builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body containing a `SettingsList`.
// 4. `SettingsList` is composed of `SettingsSection` widgets, each containing multiple `SettingsTile` widgets.
// 5. `SettingsTile` can be a navigation tile or a switch tile, each with its own functionality defined in the `onPressed` or `onToggle` callbacks.
// 6. The app provides a basic settings interface with options for language selection, dark mode toggle, password change, and sign out.
