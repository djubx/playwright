# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Humanize Duration Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `humanize_duration` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  humanize_duration: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:humanize_duration/humanize_duration.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the `humanize_duration` package to convert durations. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
Duration duration = Duration(hours: 2, minutes: 30);
String humanized = humanizeDuration(duration);
print(humanized); // Output: "2 hours and 30 minutes"
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set appropriately in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Optimizations

- **Performance**: The package is lightweight and optimized for performance, but always test on lower-end devices to ensure smooth operation.
- **Localization**: If your app supports multiple languages, consider using the localization features of the package to enhance user experience.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the `humanize_duration` package in your Flutter application effectively.

# Complete Example of Using the Humanize Duration Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:humanize_duration/humanize_duration.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Humanize Duration Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Humanize Duration Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: DurationDisplay(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DurationDisplay extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Define a duration of 2 hours and 30 minutes
    Duration duration = Duration(hours: 2, minutes: 30);
    
    // Convert the duration to a human-readable format
    String humanized = humanizeDuration(duration);
    
    return Text(
      'Duration: $humanized', // Display the humanized duration
      style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds the DurationDisplay widget.
// 4. The DurationDisplay widget defines a Duration of 2 hours and 30 minutes.
// 5. It then converts this duration into a human-readable format using the humanizeDuration function.
// 6. Finally, it displays the humanized duration in a Text widget with a font size of 24.
```
