// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The RealFlutter class is instantiated and the build method is called.
// 2. A sample escaped string is created and stored in the escapedString variable.
// 3. The unescape function from the string_unescape package is called to unescape the string.
// 4. The unescaped string is stored in the unescapedString variable and printed to the console.
// 5. A MaterialApp is returned with a single Text widget that displays the unescaped string.
// 6. The app is rendered on the screen, displaying the unescaped string.

// In summary, this code demonstrates how to use the string_unescape package to unescape a string in a Flutter app.
// The unescaped string is then displayed on the screen using a Text widget.
