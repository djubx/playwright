## Step 5: Using the Package

You can now use the **term_glyph** package in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to display text with glyphs:

```dart
Text(
  'Hello, World! ${TermGlyph.heart}',
  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),

# Complete Example of Term Glyph in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:term_glyph/term_glyph.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Term Glyph Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Term Glyph Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying a simple text with a glyph
              Text(
                'Welcome to Term Glyph! ${TermGlyph.smile}',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between texts
              // Displaying another text with a different glyph
              Text(
                'Enjoy coding! ${TermGlyph.star}',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Term Glyph Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Column widget.
// 5. Inside the Column, two Text widgets are displayed:
//    - The first Text widget shows a welcome message with a smile glyph.
//    - The second Text widget encourages coding with a star glyph.
// 6. A SizedBox is used to add space between the two Text widgets for better visual separation.
```
