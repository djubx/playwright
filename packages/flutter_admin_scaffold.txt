```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_admin_scaffold/flutter_admin_scaffold.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Admin Dashboard',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return AdminScaffold(
      // Step 1: Create a new app bar
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Admin Dashboard'),
      ),
      // Step 2: Create a new sidebar
      sideBar: SideBar(
        items: [
          SideBarItem(
            icon: Icons.dashboard,
            label: 'Dashboard',
          ),
          SideBarItem(
            icon: Icons.settings,
            label: 'Settings',
          ),
        ],
      ),
      // Step 3: Create a new body
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to the admin dashboard'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user opens the app and is presented with the admin dashboard.
// 2. The user can navigate to different pages using the sidebar.
// 3. The user can view the dashboard and settings pages.
// 4. The user can interact with the dashboard and settings pages.
```

// In summary, the code flows as follows:
// 1. The `MyApp` widget is created and returns a `MaterialApp` widget.
// 2. The `MaterialApp` widget returns a `RealFlutter` widget.
// 3. The `RealFlutter` widget returns an `AdminScaffold` widget.
// 4. The `AdminScaffold` widget returns an app bar, sidebar, and body.
// 5. The user can interact with the app bar, sidebar, and body.
