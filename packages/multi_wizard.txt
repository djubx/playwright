# Exploring the multi_wizard Flutter Package

The `multi_wizard` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to implement multi-step forms or wizards in their applications. This package simplifies the process of creating a user-friendly interface for collecting information across multiple steps, making it ideal for scenarios such as onboarding processes, surveys, or complex data entry forms.

## When to Use `multi_wizard`
- **Onboarding Flows**: When you need to guide users through a series of steps to set up their profiles or preferences.
- **Surveys and Forms**: For applications that require extensive user input, breaking the form into manageable steps can enhance user experience.
- **Checkout Processes**: In e-commerce applications, a multi-step checkout can help users feel less overwhelmed.

## Key Features
- **Step Management**: Easily manage the current step and navigate between steps.
- **Customizable UI**: Offers flexibility in designing the wizard's appearance to match your app's theme.
- **Validation Support**: Built-in support for validating user input at each step.
- **State Management**: Keeps track of user input across steps, allowing for easy data retrieval.

The `multi_wizard` package is a great choice for developers looking to enhance user experience through structured data collection.

# Setting Up and Using the multi_wizard Package

## Installation
To get started with the `multi_wizard` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  multi_wizard: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No specific configurations are required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your wizard requires any specific capabilities (like camera access).

## Basic Usage
To use the `multi_wizard` package, you need to create a `Wizard` widget and define your steps. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:multi_wizard/multi_wizard.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Wizard(
        steps: [
          Step(
            title: 'Step 1',
            content: Text('This is the first step.'),
          ),
          Step(
            title: 'Step 2',
            content: Text('This is the second step.'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic wizard with two steps. You can customize each step with forms, buttons, and other widgets as needed.

# Complete Example of multi_wizard in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:multi_wizard/multi_wizard.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Multi Wizard Example',
      home: Wizard(
        steps: [
          Step(
            title: 'Step 1: User Information',
            content: Column(
              children: [
                TextField(
                  decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Name'),
                ),
                TextField(
                  decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Email'),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ),
          Step(
            title: 'Step 2: Preferences',
            content: Column(
              children: [
                Text('Select your preferences:'),
                CheckboxListTile(
                  title: Text('Option 1'),
                  value: false,
                  onChanged: (bool? value) {},
                ),
                CheckboxListTile(
                  title: Text('Option 2'),
                  value: false,
                  onChanged: (bool? value) {},
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ),
          Step(
            title: 'Step 3: Confirmation',
            content: Column(
              children: [
                Text('Please confirm your information.'),
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () {
                    // Handle confirmation logic here
                  },
                  child: Text('Confirm'),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which initializes the MaterialApp.
// 2. Inside the MaterialApp, a Wizard widget is created with three steps.
// 3. Each step contains a title and content, which can be any widget.
// 4. The first step collects user information through text fields.
// 5. The second step allows users to select preferences using checkboxes.
// 6. The final step presents a confirmation button for users to finalize their input.
// 7. The Wizard handles navigation between steps and maintains the state of user inputs.
