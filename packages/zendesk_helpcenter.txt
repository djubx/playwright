# Tutorial: Setting Up the Zendesk Help Center Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `zendesk_helpcenter` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `zendesk_helpcenter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  zendesk_helpcenter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/zendesk_helpcenter).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version required
    }
}
```

2. Add the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<manifest>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
    <application>
        ...
    </application>
</manifest>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. Ensure your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Initialize the Package

In your main Dart file, you need to initialize the package with your Zendesk credentials. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:zendesk_helpcenter/zendesk_helpcenter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Zendesk Help Center Demo',
      home: HelpCenterScreen(),
    );
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Create the Help Center Screen

Now, create a screen that will display the Help Center:

```dart
class HelpCenterScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Help Center'),
      ),
      body: ZendeskHelpCenter(
        accountKey: 'YOUR_ZENDESK_ACCOUNT_KEY',
        onArticleSelected: (article) {
          // Handle article selection
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Replace `YOUR_ZENDESK_ACCOUNT_KEY` with your actual Zendesk account key.

## Step 5: Run Your Application

Now that everything is set up, you can run your application. You should see the Help Center integrated into your app, allowing users to browse articles and access support resources.

}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Zendesk Help Center Demo',
      home: HelpCenterScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HelpCenterScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Help Center'),
      ),
      body: ZendeskHelpCenter(
        accountKey: 'YOUR_ZENDESK_ACCOUNT_KEY', // Your Zendesk account key
        onArticleSelected: (article) {
          // Handle article selection
          // You can navigate to a detailed view of the article here
          Navigator.push(
            context,
            MaterialPageRoute(
              builder: (context) => ArticleDetailScreen(article: article),
            ),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// A simple screen to display article details
class ArticleDetailScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final Article article;

  ArticleDetailScreen({required this.article});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text(article.title), // Display the article title
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Text(article.body), // Display the article content
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with HelpCenterScreen as the home.
// 3. HelpCenterScreen displays the Zendesk Help Center.
// 4. When an article is selected, it navigates to ArticleDetailScreen.
// 5. ArticleDetailScreen shows the selected article's title and body.
