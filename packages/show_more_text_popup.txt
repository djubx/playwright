```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:show_more_text_popup/show_more_text_popup.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Show More Text Popup Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Show More Text Popup Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ShowMoreTextPopup(
          text: 'This is a short text.',
          moreText: 'This is a longer text that will be displayed in the popup.',
          backgroundColor: Colors.white,
          textColor: Colors.black,
          fontSize: 16,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a screen containing a short text.
// 2. When the user clicks on the short text, a popup is displayed with more text.
// 3. The popup is customized with a white background, black text, and a font size of 16.
// 4. The user can dismiss the popup by clicking outside of it or by pressing the back button.
// 5. The app returns to the original screen with the short text.

// In summary, this code creates a simple app that demonstrates the use of the show_more_text_popup package.
// The app displays a short text that, when clicked, displays a popup with more text.
