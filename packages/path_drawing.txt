# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Path Drawing Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started with the **path_drawing** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and include the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  path_drawing: ^<latest_version>
```
Replace `<latest_version>` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/path_drawing).

## Step 2: Installing the Package
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package to start using it:

```dart
import 'package:path_drawing/path_drawing.dart';
```

## Step 5: Basic Usage
You can now use the **path_drawing** package to create and draw paths. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a custom path and display it in a Flutter widget.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:path_drawing/path_drawing.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Path Drawing Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: CustomPaint(
            size: Size(300, 300),
            painter: PathPainter(),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class PathPainter extends CustomPainter {
  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    final paint = Paint()
      ..color = Colors.blue
      ..style = PaintingStyle.stroke
      ..strokeWidth = 5;

    // Create a path
    final path = Path()
      ..moveTo(50, 50) // Move to the starting point
      ..lineTo(250, 50) // Draw a line to the right
      ..lineTo(250, 250) // Draw a line down
      ..lineTo(50, 250) // Draw a line to the left
      ..close(); // Close the path

    // Draw the path on the canvas
    canvas.drawPath(path, paint);
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(covariant CustomPainter oldDelegate) {
    return false; // No need to repaint
  }
}
```

This code sets up a simple Flutter application that draws a square using the **path_drawing** package.

# Complete Example of Path Drawing in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:path_drawing/path_drawing.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Path Drawing Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: CustomPaint(
            size: Size(300, 300), // Set the size of the CustomPaint widget
            painter: PathPainter(), // Use the PathPainter to draw
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class PathPainter extends CustomPainter {
  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    final paint = Paint()
      ..color = Colors.blue // Set the color of the path
      ..style = PaintingStyle.stroke // Set the style to stroke
      ..strokeWidth = 5; // Set the stroke width

    // Create a path
    final path = Path()
      ..moveTo(50, 50) // Move to the starting point (50, 50)
      ..lineTo(250, 50) // Draw a line to the right (250, 50)
      ..lineTo(250, 250) // Draw a line down to (250, 250)
      ..lineTo(50, 250) // Draw a line to the left (50, 250)
      ..close(); // Close the path to form a square

    // Draw the path on the canvas
    canvas.drawPath(path, paint); // Render the path with the specified paint
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(covariant CustomPainter oldDelegate) {
    return false; // No need to repaint since the path is static
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a CustomPaint widget.
// 3. The CustomPaint widget uses PathPainter to draw on the canvas.
// 4. PathPainter's paint method creates a blue square by defining a path and drawing it on the canvas.
// 5. The application does not require repainting since the drawn path is static.
```

In this blog, we explored the **path_drawing** Flutter package, detailing its features, setup process, and providing a complete example. The application flow is straightforward: it initializes a Flutter app, sets up a custom painter, and draws a simple path on the screen. This package is a valuable addition for developers looking to enhance their Flutter applications with custom graphics and animations.
