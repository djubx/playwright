// The app starts with the `RealFlutter` widget, which creates a `MaterialApp` instance with a `RouteAnimationHelper` child.
// The `RouteAnimationHelper` instance is used to create a route animation for the app's navigation flow.
// When the user presses the "Go to Second Page" button, the app navigates to the `SecondPage` widget using a fade animation.
// When the user presses the "Go Back" button, the app navigates back to the `MyHomePage` widget using a fade animation.
// The animation durations and curves are customized to achieve a smooth and seamless transition between pages.
