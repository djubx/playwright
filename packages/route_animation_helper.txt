# Setting Up and Using route_animation_helper

## Installation
To get started with the `route_animation_helper` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  route_animation_helper: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `route_animation_helper`, you will typically wrap your navigation calls with the provided animation methods. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to navigate between two screens with a fade animation:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:route_animation_helper/route_animation_helper.dart';

class FirstScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('First Screen')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Using the fade animation for navigation
            Navigator.of(context).push(
              RouteAnimationHelper.fade(SecondScreen()),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Go to Second Screen'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SecondScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Second Screen')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Welcome to the Second Screen!')),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, the app navigates to the `SecondScreen` with a fade animation.

With this setup, you can easily implement various animations provided by the `route_animation_helper` package in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of route_animation_helper

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:route_animation_helper/route_animation_helper.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Route Animation Helper Demo',
      home: FirstScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class FirstScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('First Screen')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate to SecondScreen with a fade animation
            Navigator.of(context).push(
              RouteAnimationHelper.fade(SecondScreen()),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Go to Second Screen'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SecondScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Second Screen')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate back to FirstScreen with a slide animation
            Navigator.of(context).pop();
          },
          child: Text('Back to First Screen'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The home screen is set to FirstScreen, which contains a button.
// 3. When the button is pressed, it triggers navigation to SecondScreen using a fade animation.
// 4. SecondScreen displays a button to go back to FirstScreen.
// 5. Pressing the back button pops the current route, returning to FirstScreen.
