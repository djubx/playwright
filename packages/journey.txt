# Journey Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To add the Journey package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  journey: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run the following command to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the Journey package, you need to create a `RealFlutter` widget that will serve as the main entry point for your onboarding experience. Here’s a simple example of how to set it up:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:journey/journey.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Journey(
        pages: [
          JourneyPage(
            title: 'Welcome',
            description: 'Welcome to our amazing app!',
            image: AssetImage('assets/welcome.png'),
          ),
          JourneyPage(
            title: 'Features',
            description: 'Discover the features we offer.',
            image: AssetImage('assets/features.png'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple onboarding flow with two pages. Each page has a title, description, and an image.

### Customization
You can customize the appearance of the onboarding pages by modifying the `JourneyPage` properties, such as background color, text style, and button styles.

Now you are ready to implement the Journey package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Journey Flutter Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:journey/journey.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Journey(
        // Define the pages for the onboarding experience
        pages: [
          JourneyPage(
            title: 'Welcome',
            description: 'Welcome to our amazing app!',
            image: AssetImage('assets/welcome.png'),
          ),
          JourneyPage(
            title: 'Features',
            description: 'Discover the features we offer.',
            image: AssetImage('assets/features.png'),
          ),
          JourneyPage(
            title: 'Get Started',
            description: 'Let’s get started with your journey!',
            image: AssetImage('assets/get_started.png'),
          ),
        ],
        // Customize the skip and next buttons
        skipButton: Text('Skip'),
        nextButton: Text('Next'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The main function serves as the entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The `main` function is the entry point of the Flutter application.
2. The `RealFlutter` class is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
3. Inside the MaterialApp, we use the `Journey` widget to create the onboarding experience.
4. The `pages` property of the Journey widget contains a list of `JourneyPage` widgets, each representing a step in the onboarding process.
5. Each `JourneyPage` has a title, description, and an image to visually represent the content.
6. The `skipButton` and `nextButton` properties allow customization of the navigation buttons.
7. When the app runs, users will see the onboarding pages sequentially, with options to skip or proceed to the next page.
