# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the SFMC Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **sfmc** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  sfmc: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. Ensure your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the SFMC Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initialize the package and send a marketing email.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sfmc/sfmc.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'SFMC Example',
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomePageState createState() => _HomePageState();
}

class _HomePageState extends State<HomePage> {
  final sfmc = SFMC();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize SFMC with your credentials
    sfmc.initialize(apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY', secret: 'YOUR_SECRET');
  }

  void sendEmail() async {
    // Send a marketing email
    final response = await sfmc.sendEmail(
      to: 'user@example.com',
      subject: 'Welcome to Our Service!',
      body: 'Thank you for joining us!',
    );

    if (response.success) {
      print('Email sent successfully!');
    } else {
      print('Failed to send email: ${response.error}');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('SFMC Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: sendEmail,
          child: Text('Send Marketing Email'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example: SFMC Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sfmc/sfmc.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'SFMC Example',
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomePageState createState() => _HomePageState();
}

class _HomePageState extends State<HomePage> {
  final sfmc = SFMC(); // Create an instance of the SFMC class

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize SFMC with your credentials
    sfmc.initialize(apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY', secret: 'YOUR_SECRET');
  }

  void sendEmail() async {
    // Send a marketing email
    final response = await sfmc.sendEmail(
      to: 'user@example.com', // Recipient's email address
      subject: 'Welcome to Our Service!', // Subject of the email
      body: 'Thank you for joining us!', // Body content of the email
    );

    if (response.success) {
      print('Email sent successfully!'); // Log success message
    } else {
      print('Failed to send email: ${response.error}'); // Log error message
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('SFMC Example'), // Title of the app
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: sendEmail, // Trigger sendEmail function on button press
          child: Text('Send Marketing Email'), // Button label
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home page.
// 3. HomePage is a StatefulWidget that initializes the SFMC instance.
// 4. In initState, the SFMC is initialized with API credentials.
// 5. The sendEmail function is defined to send a marketing email when called.
// 6. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a button.
// 7. When the button is pressed, the sendEmail function is executed, sending an email and logging the result.
```
