# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Diagonal Decoration Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the **diagonal_decoration** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  diagonal_decoration: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a diagonal decoration in a container.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:diagonal_decoration/diagonal_decoration.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Diagonal Decoration Example')),
      body: Container(
        decoration: DiagonalDecoration(
          color: Colors.blue,
          angle: 45, // Set the angle of the diagonal
          gradient: LinearGradient(
            colors: [Colors.blue, Colors.green],
            begin: Alignment.topLeft,
            end: Alignment.bottomRight,
          ),
        ),
        child: Center(
          child: Text(
            'Hello, Diagonal Decoration!',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.white),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple app with a diagonal background using the **diagonal_decoration** package. The `DiagonalDecoration` widget allows us to set the color and angle of the diagonal, as well as apply a gradient.

# Complete Example of Diagonal Decoration

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:diagonal_decoration/diagonal_decoration.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Diagonal Decoration Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Diagonal Decoration Example')),
        body: Container(
          // Applying diagonal decoration to the container
          decoration: DiagonalDecoration(
            color: Colors.blue, // Base color for the diagonal
            angle: 45, // Angle of the diagonal
            gradient: LinearGradient(
              colors: [Colors.blue, Colors.green], // Gradient colors
              begin: Alignment.topLeft, // Start of the gradient
              end: Alignment.bottomRight, // End of the gradient
            ),
          ),
          child: Center(
            child: Text(
              'Hello, Diagonal Decoration!',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.white), // Text style
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body is a Container that uses DiagonalDecoration for its background.
// 5. The DiagonalDecoration is configured with a blue color, a 45-degree angle, and a gradient from blue to green.
// 6. Inside the Container, a Center widget is used to center the text "Hello, Diagonal Decoration!".
// 7. The text is styled with a font size of 24 and white color for visibility against the background.
```
