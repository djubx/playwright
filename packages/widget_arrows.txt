# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Widget Arrows

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `widget_arrows` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  widget_arrows: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:widget_arrows/widget_arrows.dart';
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` if your arrows interact with device features. However, for basic usage, no additional configuration is required.

## Step 4: Using Widget Arrows

You can now use the `WidgetArrow` class to create arrows pointing to your desired widgets. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
WidgetArrow(
  target: yourWidget, // The widget you want to point to
  arrowDirection: ArrowDirection.right, // Direction of the arrow
  arrowColor: Colors.red, // Color of the arrow
  arrowSize: 20.0, // Size of the arrow
),
```

This will create an arrow pointing to `yourWidget` with the specified properties.

# Complete Example of Using Widget Arrows

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:widget_arrows/widget_arrows.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Widget Arrows Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Widget Arrows Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // This is the widget we want to point to
              Container(
                key: ValueKey('targetWidget'), // Key for targeting
                padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
                color: Colors.blue,
                child: Text(
                  'Target Widget',
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
                ),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 50), // Space between widgets
              // Adding the arrow pointing to the target widget
              WidgetArrow(
                target: ValueKey('targetWidget'), // Targeting the above widget
                arrowDirection: ArrowDirection.down, // Arrow pointing down
                arrowColor: Colors.red, // Arrow color
                arrowSize: 20.0, // Arrow size
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'Widget Arrows Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its children.
// 5. A Column widget is used to arrange the target widget and the arrow vertically.
// 6. The target widget is a blue container with text 'Target Widget', which is given a key for identification.
// 7. A SizedBox is added for spacing between the target widget and the arrow.
// 8. The WidgetArrow is created, pointing to the target widget with specified properties like direction, color, and size.
// 9. The arrow visually indicates the target widget, enhancing user interaction and understanding.
