<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# alt_sms_autofill Flutter Package

The `alt_sms_autofill` package is a Flutter plugin designed to simplify the process of autofilling SMS codes in mobile applications. This package is particularly useful for applications that require user verification via SMS, such as two-factor authentication (2FA) or account verification processes. By leveraging this package, developers can enhance user experience by automatically detecting and filling in the SMS verification codes sent to users.

## When to Use This Package

- **SMS Verification**: When your application requires users to verify their phone numbers via SMS.
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: For applications that implement 2FA, this package can streamline the process of entering verification codes.
- **User Experience Enhancement**: To reduce user friction by automatically filling in codes, making the login or verification process faster and more efficient.

## Features

- **Automatic SMS Code Detection**: The package listens for incoming SMS messages and extracts the verification code.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Customizable**: Developers can customize the behavior and appearance of the autofill feature to fit their application's design.

By integrating the `alt_sms_autofill` package, developers can significantly improve the user experience in applications that rely on SMS-based verification.

# Tutorial: Setting Up alt_sms_autofill

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `alt_sms_autofill` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `alt_sms_autofill` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  alt_sms_autofill: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_SMS"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_SMS"/>
   ```

2. **SMS Retriever API**: To ensure that your app can receive SMS messages, you may want to implement the SMS Retriever API. This allows your app to receive SMS messages without requiring the user to grant SMS permissions.

### iOS Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

   ```xml
   <key>NSContactsUsageDescription</key>
   <string>This app requires access to your contacts.</string>
   ```

2. **SMS Handling**: iOS does not allow apps to read SMS messages directly. Instead, you can use the `alt_sms_autofill` package to listen for incoming SMS messages that contain a specific format.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your Flutter application.

1. **Import the Package**:

   ```dart
   import 'package:alt_sms_autofill/alt_sms_autofill.dart';
   ```

2. **Initialize the Autofill**:

   You can initialize the autofill in your main widget or wherever appropriate in your application.

   ```dart
   @override
   void initState() {
     super.initState();
     AltSmsAutofill().listenForCode;
   }
   ```

3. **Create a TextField for Code Input**:

   Create a `TextField` to display the SMS code and listen for autofill events.

   ```dart
   TextField(
     onChanged: (value) {
       // Handle the input value
     },
     decoration: InputDecoration(
       hintText: 'Enter SMS Code',
     ),
   );
   ```

4. **Handle Incoming SMS Codes**:

   You can listen for incoming SMS codes and automatically fill the `TextField`.

   ```dart
   AltSmsAutofill().listenForCode;
   ```

By following these steps, you can successfully integrate the `alt_sms_autofill` package into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of alt_sms_autofill

Here is a complete example of a Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the `alt_sms_autofill` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:alt_sms_autofill/alt_sms_autofill.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _smsCode = ""; // Variable to hold the SMS code

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Start listening for incoming SMS codes
    AltSmsAutofill().listenForCode;
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('SMS Autofill Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // TextField to display the SMS code
              TextField(
                onChanged: (value) {
                  setState(() {
                    _smsCode = value; // Update the SMS code variable
                  });
                },
                decoration: InputDecoration(
                  hintText: 'Enter SMS Code',
                ),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Display the received SMS code
              Text('Received SMS Code: $_smsCode'),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget, we initialize a variable to hold the SMS code.
// 3. In the initState method, we start listening for incoming SMS codes using AltSmsAutofill().listenForCode.
// 4. The build method creates a simple UI with a TextField for the user to enter the SMS code.
// 5. As the user types in the TextField, the _smsCode variable is updated.
// 6. The received SMS code is displayed below the TextField, allowing the user to see what they have entered.
```
