# Tutorial

## Setup Process

To get started with the **crossword** package, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     crossword: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the new package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

     ```groovy
     android {
         ...
         defaultConfig {
             ...
             minSdkVersion 21
         }
     }
     ```

   - **iOS**: Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and ensure you have the necessary permissions if your app requires internet access or other features.

4. **Import the Package**: In your Dart files, import the package:

   ```dart
   import 'package:crossword/crossword.dart';
   ```

## Using the Package

To create a simple crossword puzzle, follow these steps:

1. **Initialize the Crossword**: Create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class, which will manage the crossword logic.

2. **Define the Puzzle**: Set up the crossword grid and clues.

3. **Display the Puzzle**: Use the provided widgets to display the crossword in your Flutter app.

4. **Handle User Input**: Implement logic to handle user interactions, such as filling in words and checking answers.

By following these steps, you can effectively integrate the **crossword** package into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:crossword/crossword.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Crossword Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Define the crossword grid and clues
  final List<List<String>> grid = [
    ['C', 'A', 'T', ' '],
    [' ', ' ', ' ', ' '],
    ['D', 'O', 'G', ' '],
    [' ', ' ', ' ', ' '],
    ['F', 'I', 'S', 'H'],
  ];

  final List<String> clues = [
    '1. A small domesticated carnivorous mammal',
    '2. A common pet that barks',
    '3. A creature that swims',
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Crossword Puzzle'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Display the crossword grid
          Crossword(
            grid: grid,
            onWordCompleted: (word) {
              // Handle word completion
              print('Completed word: $word');
            },
          ),
          // Display clues
          Expanded(
            child: ListView.builder(
              itemCount: clues.length,
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text(clues[index]),
                );
              },
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app and sets MyApp as the home widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme, and sets RealFlutter as the home screen.
// 3. RealFlutter is a stateful widget that manages the crossword puzzle state.
// 4. The crossword grid and clues are defined as lists.
// 5. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Column layout.
// 6. The Crossword widget displays the grid, and a ListView shows the clues.
// 7. When a word is completed, the onWordCompleted callback is triggered, allowing for further actions.
