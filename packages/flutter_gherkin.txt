# Flutter Gherkin Package Overview
=====================================

The `flutter_gherkin` package is a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) testing framework for Flutter applications. It allows you to write tests in a natural language style, making it easier to understand and maintain your test suite.

### When to Use This Package

This package is ideal for teams who want to adopt BDD testing for their Flutter applications. It's particularly useful when you want to ensure that your app's behavior is correct and aligns with the business requirements.

### Features

*   Write tests in a natural language style using Gherkin syntax
*   Support for step definitions in Dart
*   Integration with Flutter's test framework
*   Support for multiple platforms (Android and iOS)

# Setting Up Flutter Gherkin
==========================

To use the `flutter_gherkin` package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your `pubspec.yaml` File

```yml
dependencies:
  flutter_gherkin: ^1.1.1
```

### Step 2: Create a Test File

Create a new file called `features/example.feature` with the following content:

```gherkin
Feature: Example
  Scenario: Example scenario
    Given the app is running
    When I tap the button
    Then I should see the result
```

### Step 3: Create Step Definitions

Create a new file called `step_definitions/example_steps.dart` with the following content:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_gherkin/flutter_gherkin.dart';

class ExampleSteps {
  @Given('the app is running')
  Future<void> theAppIsRunning() async {
    // Code to verify the app is running
  }

  @When('I tap the button')
  Future<void> iTapTheButton() async {
    // Code to tap the button
  }

  @Then('I should see the result')
  Future<void> iShouldSeeTheResult() async {
    // Code to verify the result
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Run the Tests

Run the tests using the following command:

```bash
flutter test --no-sound-null-safety
```

### Platform-Specific Details

For Android, you need to add the following configuration to your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
  testOptions {
    unitTests.includeAndroidResources = true
  }
}
```

For iOS, you need to add the following configuration to your `ios/Podfile` file:

```ruby
target 'Runner' do
  use_frameworks!
  use_modular_headers!
end
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_gherkin/flutter_gherkin.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a Material app with a single page
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Real Flutter',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Real Flutter'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // When the button is pressed, show a snackbar
              ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                SnackBar(content: Text('Button pressed')),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Press me'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The following comments explain the flow of the application
// 
// 1. The user runs the app and sees the Material app with a single page
// 2. The user presses the button and sees a snackbar with the text "Button pressed"
// 3. The user can press the button multiple times to see the snackbar again
// 
// The code uses the `MaterialApp` widget to create a Material app with a single page
// The page has an `AppBar` with a title and a `Scaffold` with a body
// The body has a `Center` widget with an `ElevatedButton`
// When the button is pressed, it shows a snackbar using the `ScaffoldMessenger`
// 
// The code is a simple example of a Material app with a single page and a button
// It demonstrates how to create a Material app and show a snackbar when a button is pressed

// Created/Modified files during execution:
// None
