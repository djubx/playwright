# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Ternav Icons

## Installation
To add the **ternav_icons** package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ternav_icons: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if you are using any icons that require specific permissions (e.g., location icons).

## Using Ternav Icons
To use the icons in your Flutter application, import the package at the top of your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:ternav_icons/ternav_icons.dart';
```

You can then use the icons in your widgets. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use an icon in a `IconButton`:

```dart
IconButton(
  icon: Icon(TernavIcons.home), // Using the home icon from the package
  onPressed: () {
    // Action when the button is pressed
  },
)
```

You can customize the icon's size and color as follows:

```dart
Icon(
  TernavIcons.settings,
  size: 30.0, // Custom size
  color: Colors.blue, // Custom color
)
```

# Complete Example of Ternav Icons in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ternav_icons/ternav_icons.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Ternav Icons Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Ternav Icons Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying a home icon
              Icon(
                TernavIcons.home,
                size: 50.0, // Setting the size of the icon
                color: Colors.green, // Setting the color of the icon
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              // Displaying a settings icon
              Icon(
                TernavIcons.settings,
                size: 50.0, // Setting the size of the icon
                color: Colors.blue, // Setting the color of the icon
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              // IconButton to navigate to another screen
              IconButton(
                icon: Icon(TernavIcons.arrow_forward), // Using the arrow icon
                iconSize: 50.0, // Setting the size of the icon button
                color: Colors.red, // Setting the color of the icon button
                onPressed: () {
                  // Action when the button is pressed
                  Navigator.push(
                    context,
                    MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => SecondScreen()),
                  );
                },
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Second screen to navigate to
class SecondScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Second Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to the second screen!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter class builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget with a Column.
// 4. Inside the Column, three widgets are displayed: a home icon, a settings icon, and an IconButton.
// 5. The home and settings icons are displayed with specified sizes and colors.
// 6. The IconButton uses the arrow icon and navigates to a second screen when pressed.
// 7. The SecondScreen class displays a simple message when navigated to.
