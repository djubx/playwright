# Setting Up and Using the Glyphicon Package in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up the `glyphicon` package in a Flutter project and demonstrate how to use it effectively.

## Setup Process

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `glyphicon` package under dependencies.

    ```yaml
    dependencies:
      flutter:
        sdk: flutter
      glyphicon: ^1.0.0
    ```

2. **Install Package**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the package.

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3. **Import Package**: In your Dart file, import the package to start using it.

    ```dart
    import 'package:glyphicon/glyphicon.dart';
    ```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

- Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to support all features of the package.

    ```gradle
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
    ```

### iOS

- Make sure your iOS deployment target is set to 11.0 or higher in your `ios/Podfile`.

    ```ruby
    platform :ios, '11.0'
    ```

## Using the Package

To use an icon from the `glyphicon` package, simply use the `Glyphicon` widget and specify the icon you want to display.

```dart
Glyphicon(
  icon: GlyphiconIcons.home,
  size: 24.0,
  color: Colors.blue,
)
```

            // Display a user icon
            Glyphicon(
              icon: GlyphiconIcons.user,
              size: 50.0,
              color: Colors.red,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Display a settings icon
            Glyphicon(
              icon: GlyphiconIcons.cog,
              size: 50.0,
              color: Colors.blue,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp.
// The MaterialApp uses IconDemoPage as its home, which is another StatelessWidget.
// IconDemoPage builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body containing a Column.
// The Column centers three Glyphicon widgets, each displaying a different icon.
// Each icon is customized with a specific size and color.
// The app demonstrates the use of the glyphicon package to display icons.
