# Setting Up flutter_widgetz: A Step-by-Step Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with flutter_widgetz, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_widgetz: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_widgetz).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using flutter_widgetz
Once the package is installed, you can start using its widgets in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use a customizable button from the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_widgetz/flutter_widgetz.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Widgetz Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: CustomButton(
            text: 'Click Me',
            onPressed: () {
              // Action to perform on button press
              print('Button Pressed!');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we import the necessary packages and create a simple app with a customizable button. The `CustomButton` widget from flutter_widgetz allows us to easily create a button with a specified action.

With these steps, you are now ready to integrate flutter_widgetz into your Flutter applications!

# Complete Example of flutter_widgetz in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_widgetz/flutter_widgetz.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Widgetz Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Using a CustomButton from flutter_widgetz
          child: CustomButton(
            text: 'Click Me',
            onPressed: () {
              // Action to perform on button press
              print('Button Pressed!');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The runApp function initializes the app and takes the RealFlutter widget as the root.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 4. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Flutter Widgetz Example'.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold is centered, containing a CustomButton widget.
// 6. The CustomButton displays the text 'Click Me' and has an onPressed callback.
// 7. When the button is pressed, it triggers the print statement, logging 'Button Pressed!' to the console.
// 8. This simple flow demonstrates how to integrate and use a widget from the flutter_widgetz package effectively.
