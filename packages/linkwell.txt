# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Linkwell

## Step 1: Adding Dependency

To get started with Linkwell, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  linkwell: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to open links. You may need to add the following intent filter to your activity:

```xml
<activity android:name=".MainActivity">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
        <data android:scheme="http" />
        <data android:scheme="https" />
    </intent-filter>
</activity>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` to allow your app to open URLs. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
    <string>http</string>
    <string>https</string>
</array>
```

## Step 4: Using Linkwell in Your Application

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement Linkwell in your app.

# Complete Example of Linkwell in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:linkwell/linkwell.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Linkwell Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Linkwell Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
            child: LinkWell(
              // The text that contains links
              text: 'Check out Flutter at https://flutter.dev and email us at example@example.com!',
              // Customizing the link style
              linkStyle: TextStyle(
                color: Colors.blue,
                fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
              ),
              // Callback for link tap
              onTap: (link) {
                // Handle the link tap
                print('Tapped on link: $link');
                // You can use url_launcher to open the link
              },
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, we use the LinkWell widget to display text with clickable links.
// 5. The text contains a URL and an email address, which Linkwell automatically detects and makes clickable.
// 6. The linkStyle property customizes the appearance of the links.
// 7. The onTap callback is triggered when a link is tapped, allowing you to handle the action (e.g., opening the link).
// 8. The app is structured to provide a clean and interactive experience for users, showcasing the capabilities of the Linkwell package.
```

In summary, the Linkwell package provides a simple yet effective way to manage links in Flutter applications. By following the setup and implementation steps outlined above, you can enhance your app's interactivity and user experience. The complete example demonstrates how to integrate Linkwell seamlessly, allowing for clickable links within your text.
