// Final summary:
// The code flows by first creating a Material app with a home page.
// The home page contains a button that, when pressed, shows an admonition using the `showAdmonition` function.
// The `showAdmonition` function takes an `Admonition` widget as an argument, which is displayed on the screen with the specified duration.
// After the duration, the `Admonition` widget is automatically dismissed.
