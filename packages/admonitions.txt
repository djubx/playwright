# Setting Up and Using the Admonitions Package

## Installation
To get started with the Admonitions package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  admonitions: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the Admonitions package, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:admonitions/admonitions.dart';
```

You can then create admonitions in your widget tree. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
Admonition(
  title: 'Information',
  content: 'This is an informational message.',
  type: AdmonitionType.info,
)
```

This will create an informational admonition that can be placed anywhere in your widget tree.

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Admonitions Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(

        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Column(
            children: [
              // Displaying an informational admonition
              Admonition(
                title: 'Information',
                content: 'This is an informational message.',
                type: AdmonitionType.info,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between admonitions
              
              // Displaying a warning admonition
              Admonition(
                title: 'Warning',
                content: 'This is a warning message.',
                type: AdmonitionType.warning,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between admonitions
              
              // Displaying an error admonition
              Admonition(
                title: 'Error',
                content: 'This is an error message.',
                type: AdmonitionType.error,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between admonitions
              
              // Displaying a success admonition
              Admonition(
                title: 'Success',
                content: 'This is a success message.',
                type: AdmonitionType.success,
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// Inside the Scaffold, we have an AppBar and a body containing a column of admonitions.
// Each admonition is created using the Admonition widget, specifying the title, content, and type.
// The types include info, warning, error, and success, demonstrating the versatility of the package.
// SizedBox widgets are used to add spacing between the admonitions for better visual separation.
