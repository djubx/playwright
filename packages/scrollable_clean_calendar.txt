## Step 5: Using the Calendar Widget

You can now use the `ScrollableCleanCalendar` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

  },
  events: {
    DateTime(2024, 9, 10): ['Event 1', 'Event 2'],

# Complete Example of Scrollable Clean Calendar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:scrollable_clean_calendar/scrollable_clean_calendar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Scrollable Clean Calendar Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  DateTime selectedDate = DateTime.now(); // Variable to hold the selected date
  Map<DateTime, List<String>> events = {
    DateTime(2024, 9, 10): ['Event 1', 'Event 2'], // Events for specific dates
    DateTime(2024, 9, 15): ['Event 3'],
  };

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Scrollable Clean Calendar'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Display the calendar widget
          ScrollableCleanCalendar(
            onDateSelected: (DateTime date) {
              setState(() {
                selectedDate = date; // Update the selected date
              });
              print("Selected date: $date"); // Log the selected date
            },
            events: events, // Pass the events to the calendar
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20),
          // Display the selected date
          Text(
            'Selected Date: ${selectedDate.toLocal()}'.split(' ')[0], // Show the selected date
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home as RealFlutter.
// 3. RealFlutter is a stateful widget that maintains the selected date and events.
// 4. The ScrollableCleanCalendar widget is displayed, allowing users to select dates.
// 5. When a date is selected, the onDateSelected callback updates the selected date and logs it.
// 6. The selected date is displayed below the calendar.
