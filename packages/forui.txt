# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Forui

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the Forui package and demonstrate how to use its features effectively.

## Step 1: Adding Forui to Your Project

To get started, you need to add the Forui package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  forui: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # Ensure this is set to at least 10.0
```

## Step 3: Using Forui in Your Application

Now that you have set up the Forui package, you can start using its widgets in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a responsive layout using Forui.

1. Import the Forui package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:forui/forui.dart';
```

2. Use Forui widgets in your widget tree. For example, you can create a responsive card layout:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Forui Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ForuiCard(
          title: 'Hello Forui',
          content: 'This is a responsive card using Forui.',
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

With these steps, you are now ready to leverage the power of the Forui package in your Flutter applications!

# Complete Example of Forui in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:forui/forui.dart'; // Importing the Forui package

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp()); // Entry point of the application
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Forui Example',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: RealFlutter(), // Setting the home widget
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Forui Example')), // AppBar with title
      body: Center(
        child: ForuiCard(
          title: 'Hello Forui', // Title of the card
          content: 'This is a responsive card using Forui.', // Content of the card
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application, which calls runApp().
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to RealFlutter, which is the main screen of the app.
// 4. RealFlutter builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a ForuiCard is created with a title and content.
// 6. The ForuiCard widget is a customizable card that displays the provided title and content.
// 7. The app is now ready to run, showcasing the Forui package's capabilities in creating a responsive UI.
