# fwfh_svg Flutter Package

The `fwfh_svg` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to incorporate scalable vector graphics (SVG) into their applications. SVGs are widely used for their scalability and resolution independence, making them ideal for responsive designs. This package simplifies the process of rendering SVG images in Flutter, allowing developers to create visually appealing applications without compromising on performance.

## When to Use `fwfh_svg`

You should consider using the `fwfh_svg` package in scenarios such as:

- **Iconography**: When you need to use icons that scale well across different screen sizes and resolutions.
- **Illustrations**: For applications that require detailed illustrations that maintain quality regardless of scaling.
- **Animations**: When you want to create animated graphics that are lightweight and responsive.

## Features

- **Easy Integration**: Simple API for loading and displaying SVG images.
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient rendering of SVGs to ensure smooth performance.
- **Customizable**: Options to customize the appearance of SVGs, including color and size adjustments.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

By leveraging the `fwfh_svg` package, developers can enhance their Flutter applications with high-quality graphics that are both flexible and efficient.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `fwfh_svg`

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `fwfh_svg` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `fwfh_svg` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  fwfh_svg: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable the use of SVGs by adding the following to your `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>fetch</string>
</array>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that the package is set up, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to display an SVG image.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fwfh_svg/fwfh_svg.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('fwfh_svg Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: SvgPicture.asset(
            'assets/images/example.svg', // Path to your SVG file
            width: 100.0, // Set the width of the SVG
            height: 100.0, // Set the height of the SVG
            color: Colors.blue, // Optional: Change the color of the SVG
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we import the necessary packages, create a simple Flutter application, and display an SVG image in the center of the screen. You can customize the width, height, and color of the SVG as needed.

# Complete Example of `fwfh_svg`

Below is a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the `fwfh_svg` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fwfh_svg/fwfh_svg.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'fwfh_svg Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('fwfh_svg Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying the SVG image
              SvgPicture.asset(
                'assets/images/example.svg', // Path to your SVG file
                width: 100.0, // Set the width of the SVG
                height: 100.0, // Set the height of the SVG
                color: Colors.blue, // Optional: Change the color of the SVG
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Add space between the SVG and text
              Text(
                'This is an SVG image!', // Text below the SVG
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the main UI.
// 3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a title.
// 4. A Scaffold widget is used to provide the basic visual structure.
// 5. An AppBar is added with the title 'fwfh_svg Example'.
// 6. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget to center its child.
// 7. A Column widget is used to arrange the SVG image and text vertically.
// 8. The SvgPicture.asset method is called to load and display the SVG image.
// 9. The width, height, and color of the SVG can be customized.
// 10. A Text widget is added below the SVG to provide additional context.
// 11. Finally, the runApp function is called to launch the application.
```
