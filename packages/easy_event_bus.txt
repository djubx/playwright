# Easy Event Bus: A Flutter Package for Event Management

The `easy_event_bus` package is a lightweight and efficient event bus implementation for Flutter applications. It allows developers to create a publish-subscribe pattern, enabling different parts of an application to communicate with each other without tight coupling. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to decouple components, such as in large applications with multiple screens or modules.

## When to Use `easy_event_bus`
- **Decoupled Communication**: When you need to send messages between different parts of your app without direct references.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: For applications that follow an event-driven architecture, where components react to events rather than calling each other directly.
- **State Management**: As a complement to state management solutions, allowing for more granular control over events.

## Key Features
- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead, making it suitable for performance-sensitive applications.
- **Flexible**: Supports multiple event types and allows for easy subscription and unsubscription.
- **Thread-Safe**: Ensures that events are handled safely across different threads.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `easy_event_bus`

## Installation
To add `easy_event_bus` to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  easy_event_bus: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Basic Usage
### Importing the Package
In your Dart files, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:easy_event_bus/easy_event_bus.dart';
```

### Creating an Event Bus
You can create a global instance of the event bus:

```dart
final eventBus = EventBus();
```

### Defining Events
Define the events you want to listen for. For example:

```dart
class UserLoggedInEvent {
  final String username;
  UserLoggedInEvent(this.username);
}
```

### Subscribing to Events
You can subscribe to events using the `on` method:

```dart
eventBus.on<UserLoggedInEvent>().listen((event) {
  print('User logged in: ${event.username}');
});
```

### Publishing Events
To publish an event, use the `fire` method:

```dart
eventBus.fire(UserLoggedInEvent('JohnDoe'));
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 16 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 9.0 in your `ios/Podfile`.

## Optimizations
- Use `eventBus.on<T>()` to listen for specific event types to avoid unnecessary processing.
- Unsubscribe from events when they are no longer needed to prevent memory leaks.

# Complete Example of Using `easy_event_bus`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:easy_event_bus/easy_event_bus.dart';

// Create a global instance of the event bus
final eventBus = EventBus();

// Define an event class
class UserLoggedInEvent {
  final String username;
  UserLoggedInEvent(this.username);
}

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Easy Event Bus Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home Screen')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Publish a UserLoggedInEvent when the button is pressed
            eventBus.fire(UserLoggedInEvent('JohnDoe'));
          },
          child: Text('Log In'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class ListenerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ListenerScreenState createState() => _ListenerScreenState();
}

class _ListenerScreenState extends State<ListenerScreen> {
  String _username = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Subscribe to UserLoggedInEvent
    eventBus.on<UserLoggedInEvent>().listen((event) {
      setState(() {
        _username = event.username; // Update the username when the event is received
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Listener Screen')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Logged in user: $_username'), // Display the logged-in username
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The application starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// The HomeScreen widget contains a button that, when pressed, publishes a UserLoggedInEvent.
// The ListenerScreen widget listens for UserLoggedInEvent and updates its state when the event is received.
// The username is displayed on the ListenerScreen, showing the communication between the two screens via the event bus.
