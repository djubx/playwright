### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your app requires access to the camera or photo library for color selection.

## Using the Package
To use the `flutter_color_picker_wheel`, you can create a simple widget that incorporates the color picker. Below is a basic example of how to implement it in your Flutter application.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:
   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter_color_picker_wheel/flutter_color_picker_wheel.dart';
   ```

2. Create a stateful widget to manage the selected color:
   ```dart
   class ColorPickerExample extends StatefulWidget {
     @override
     _ColorPickerExampleState createState() => _ColorPickerExampleState();
   }

   class _ColorPickerExampleState extends State<ColorPickerExample> {
     Color selectedColor = Colors.red; // Default color

     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return Scaffold(
         appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Color Picker Wheel')),
         body: Center(
           child: Column(
             mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
             children: [
               // Display the selected color
               Container(
                 width: 100,
                 height: 100,
                 color: selectedColor,
               ),
               // Color picker wheel
               ColorPickerWheel(
                 onColorChanged: (color) {
                   setState(() {
                     selectedColor = color; // Update the selected color
                   });
                 },
               ),
             ],
           ),
         ),
       );
     }
   }
   ```

This example sets up a basic color picker that updates a container's color based on user selection.

# Complete Example of flutter_color_picker_wheel

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_color_picker_wheel/flutter_color_picker_wheel.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Color Picker Wheel Example',
      home: ColorPickerExample(),
    );
  }
}

class ColorPickerExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ColorPickerExampleState createState() => _ColorPickerExampleState();
}

class _ColorPickerExampleState extends State<ColorPickerExample> {
  Color selectedColor = Colors.red; // Default color

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Color Picker Wheel')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the selected color in a square container
            Container(
              width: 100,
              height: 100,
              color: selectedColor, // Set the container color to the selected color
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Add some space between elements
            // Color picker wheel widget
            ColorPickerWheel(
              onColorChanged: (color) {
                setState(() {
                  selectedColor = color; // Update the selected color when the user picks a new color
                });
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and home set to ColorPickerExample.
// 3. ColorPickerExample is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the selected color.
// 4. In the _ColorPickerExampleState, a default color (red) is set.
// 5. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget containing a Column.
// 6. The Column displays a Container that shows the currently selected color and a ColorPickerWheel.
// 7. When the user selects a color from the wheel, the onColorChanged callback updates the selectedColor state, which in turn updates the Container's color.
