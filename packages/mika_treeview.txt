# Setting Up and Using mika_treeview

## Installation
To get started with `mika_treeview`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  mika_treeview: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/mika_treeview).

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No specific configurations are required for Android. Just ensure that your Flutter environment is set up correctly.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the latest version of Xcode installed. No additional configurations are necessary for using `mika_treeview`.

## Basic Usage
To use `mika_treeview`, you need to import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:mika_treeview/mika_treeview.dart';
```

You can then create a simple tree view by defining your data structure and passing it to the `MikaTreeView` widget.

### Example Structure
Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to set up a tree view:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Mika Tree View Example')),
      body: MikaTreeView(
        nodes: [
          TreeNode(
            label: 'Root',
            children: [
              TreeNode(label: 'Child 1'),
              TreeNode(label: 'Child 2', children: [
                TreeNode(label: 'Grandchild 1'),
                TreeNode(label: 'Grandchild 2'),
              ]),
            ],
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code creates a simple tree view with a root node and two child nodes, one of which has its own children.

With this setup, you can start building more complex tree structures as needed.

# Complete Example of mika_treeview

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mika_treeview/mika_treeview.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Mika Tree View Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Mika Tree View Example')),
        body: MikaTreeView(
          nodes: [
            // Creating the root node
            TreeNode(
              label: 'Root',
              children: [
                // Adding first child node
                TreeNode(label: 'Child 1'),
                // Adding second child node with its own children
                TreeNode(label: 'Child 2', children: [
                  TreeNode(label: 'Grandchild 1'),
                  TreeNode(label: 'Grandchild 2'),
                ]),
              ],
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Mika Tree View Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold includes a MikaTreeView widget.
// 5. The MikaTreeView is populated with a root TreeNode that has two children: 'Child 1' and 'Child 2'.
// 6. 'Child 2' further contains two grandchildren: 'Grandchild 1' and 'Grandchild 2'.
// 7. The tree view is displayed, allowing users to expand or collapse nodes to navigate through the hierarchy.
