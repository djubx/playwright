# Setting Up and Using flutter_map_math

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_map_math` package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter applications.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_map_math` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_map_math: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configurations

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file, especially if your application will access location services. Add the following keys:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your location.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your location.</string>
```

## Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_map/flutter_map.dart';
import 'package:flutter_map_math/flutter_map_math.dart';
```

## Step 4: Basic Usage

You can now use the functionalities provided by `flutter_map_math`. Here’s a simple example of how to calculate the distance between two geographical points:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_map/flutter_map.dart';
import 'package:flutter_map_math/flutter_map_math.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Define two geographical points
    final point1 = LatLng(37.7749, -122.4194); // San Francisco
    final point2 = LatLng(34.0522, -118.2437); // Los Angeles

    // Calculate the distance between the two points
    final distance = calculateDistance(point1, point2);
    
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Distance Calculation')),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Distance: ${distance.toStringAsFixed(2)} meters'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we define two geographical points and calculate the distance between them using the `calculateDistance` function from the `flutter_map_math` package.

# Complete Example of flutter_map_math

Here’s a complete Flutter application that demonstrates the key features of the `flutter_map_math` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_map/flutter_map.dart';
import 'package:flutter_map_math/flutter_map_math.dart';
import 'package:latlong2/latlong.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a map controller
    final MapController mapController = MapController();

    // Define geographical points for demonstration
    final LatLng point1 = LatLng(37.7749, -122.4194); // San Francisco
    final LatLng point2 = LatLng(34.0522, -118.2437); // Los Angeles

    // Calculate the distance between the two points
    final double distance = calculateDistance(point1, point2);

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('flutter_map_math Example')),
        body: FlutterMap(
          mapController: mapController,
          options: MapOptions(
            center: LatLng(36.7783, -119.4179), // Center of California
            zoom: 6.0,
          ),
          layers: [
            TileLayerOptions(
              urlTemplate: "https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",
              subdomains: ['a', 'b', 'c'],
            ),
            MarkerLayerOptions(
              markers: [
                Marker(
                  point: point1,
                  builder: (ctx) => Icon(Icons.location_on, color: Colors.red),
                ),
                Marker(
                  point: point2,
                  builder: (ctx) => Icon(Icons.location_on, color: Colors.blue),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ],
        ),
        floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Show the distance in a snackbar
            ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
              SnackBar(content: Text('Distance: ${distance.toStringAsFixed(2)} meters')),
            );
          },
          child: Icon(Icons.info),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation

// The application starts by importing necessary packages and defining the main class RealFlutter.
// Inside the build method, we create a MapController to manage the map's state.
// We define two geographical points: point1 (San Francisco) and point2 (Los Angeles).
// The distance between these two points is calculated using the calculateDistance function from flutter_map_math.
// The FlutterMap widget is set up with a TileLayer for OpenStreetMap tiles and two markers for the defined points.
// A FloatingActionButton is provided to show the calculated distance in a snackbar when pressed.
// Finally, the app is run using the runApp function, initializing the RealFlutter widget.

// This example demonstrates how to integrate the flutter_map_math package with Flutter Map,
// allowing for geographical calculations and visual representation on a map.
