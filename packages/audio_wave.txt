# Audio Wave Flutter Package
The `audio_wave` Flutter package is a powerful tool for visualizing and manipulating audio waveforms in Flutter applications. It provides a simple and efficient way to display audio waveforms, allowing developers to create visually appealing and interactive audio experiences.

## When to Use
The `audio_wave` package is ideal for applications that require audio visualization, such as:

* Music players
* Audio editors
* Podcast apps
* Voice recorders

## Features
The `audio_wave` package offers the following features:

* Real-time audio waveform visualization
* Customizable waveform colors and styles
* Support for various audio formats (e.g., MP3, WAV, AAC)
* Platform-specific optimizations for Android and iOS

# Setting Up the Audio Wave Package
To use the `audio_wave` package, follow these steps:

1. Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  audio_wave: ^1.0.0
```
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.
3. Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:audio_wave/audio_wave.dart';
```
### Platform-Specific Configurations
For Android, add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```
For iOS, add the following lines to your `Info.plist` file:
```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs access to the microphone to record audio.</string>
```
### Optimizations
To optimize performance, consider the following:

* Use a smaller waveform size for better performance.
* Use a lower sample rate for audio files.

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Create an instance of the AudioWave widget
  AudioWave _audioWave;

  // Load an audio file
  Future<void> _loadAudioFile() async {
    // Replace with your own audio file
    String audioFile = 'assets/audio_file.mp3';
    _audioWave = AudioWave(
      audioFile: audioFile,
      // Customize the waveform color and style
      waveColor: Colors.blue,
      waveStyle: WaveStyle.solid,
    );
  }

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _loadAudioFile();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Audio Wave Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: _audioWave,
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application flow:
// 1. The app loads an audio file using the _loadAudioFile method.
// 2. The AudioWave widget is created with the loaded audio file.
// 3. The waveform is customized with a blue color and solid style.
// 4. The AudioWave widget is displayed in the center of the screen.
// 5. The app updates the waveform in real-time as the audio plays.

// Final summary:
// The code flows by first loading an audio file, then creating an instance of the AudioWave widget with the loaded audio file. The waveform is customized and displayed in the center of the screen. The app updates the waveform in real-time as the audio plays.
