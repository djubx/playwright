## Complete Example

Here’s a complete example of a Flutter application using the `wrap_and_more` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:wrap_and_more/wrap_and_more.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Wrap and More Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Wrap and More Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: WrapAndMore(
            alignment: WrapAlignment.center, // Center the children
            spacing: 10.0, // Space between items
            runSpacing: 10.0, // Space between rows
            children: List.generate(10, (index) {
              return Container(
                width: 80,
                height: 80,
                color: Colors.blue[(index + 1) * 100], // Different shades of blue
                child: Center(
                  child: Text(
                    'Item $index',
                    style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
                  ),
                ),
              );
            }),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. In the body, we use the WrapAndMore widget to create a responsive layout.
// 5. The WrapAndMore widget centers its children and provides spacing between them.
// 6. We generate a list of 10 containers with different shades of blue, each labeled with its index.
// 7. The containers are displayed in a wrapped layout, adjusting based on the available screen space.
```

### Summary of Application Flow
// The application starts with the `main` function, which initializes the `RealFlutter` widget. 
// The `RealFlutter` widget builds a `MaterialApp` containing a `Scaffold` with an `AppBar` and a body. 
// The body features the `WrapAndMore` widget, which arranges its children in a responsive layout, 
// centering them and providing specified spacing. 
// A list of 10 containers is generated, each with a unique shade of blue and labeled with its index, 
// demonstrating the flexibility and responsiveness of the `wrap_and_more` package.
