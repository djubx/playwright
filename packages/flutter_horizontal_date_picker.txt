# Complete Example of flutter_horizontal_date_picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_horizontal_date_picker/flutter_horizontal_date_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Horizontal Date Picker Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  DateTime selectedDate = DateTime.now(); // Variable to hold the selected date

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Horizontal Date Picker')),
      body: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: [
          // Display the currently selected date
          Text(
            'Selected Date: ${selectedDate.toLocal()}'.split(' ')[0],
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20), // Add some spacing
          // Horizontal Date Picker widget
          HorizontalDatePicker(
            initialDate: selectedDate,
            onDateSelected: (date) {
              setState(() {
                selectedDate = date; // Update the selected date
              });
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home as RealFlutter.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains the selected date state.
// 4. In the build method, it displays the currently selected date and the HorizontalDatePicker.
// 5. When a date is selected from the picker, the onDateSelected callback updates the selectedDate state.
// 6. The UI rebuilds to reflect the newly selected date.
```
