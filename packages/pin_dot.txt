- **Flexible Input Handling**: The package supports various input types, making it suitable for different use cases.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate into existing Flutter applications with minimal setup.
- **Responsive Design**: The input field adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.

## When to Use
- When building authentication screens that require PIN or verification code input.
- In applications where a user needs to enter a short code, such as two-factor authentication.
- For creating a visually appealing and user-friendly input experience.

Overall, `pin_dot` enhances the user experience by providing a clean and modern interface for pin input.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using pin_dot

## Installation
To add the `pin_dot` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  pin_dot: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No specific configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your app requires any specific capabilities related to user input.

## Using the Package
To use the `pin_dot` package, you can create a simple pin input widget in your Flutter application. Below is a basic example of how to implement it.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pin_dot/pin_dot.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Pin Dot Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: PinDot(
            length: 4, // Number of dots
            onChanged: (value) {
              // Handle the input value
              print('Entered PIN: $value');
            },
            dotColor: Colors.blue, // Customize dot color
            activeDotColor: Colors.green, // Customize active dot color
            dotSize: 20.0, // Customize dot size
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application with a pin input field using the `pin_dot` package. The `onChanged` callback allows you to handle the input value as the user types.

# Complete Example of pin_dot in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pin_dot/pin_dot.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Pin Dot Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: PinDot(
            length: 4, // Set the number of dots for the PIN input
            onChanged: (value) {
              // This callback is triggered whenever the input changes
              print('Entered PIN: $value'); // Print the entered PIN to the console
            },
            dotColor: Colors.blue, // Set the color of the inactive dots
            activeDotColor: Colors.green, // Set the color of the active dot
            dotSize: 20.0, // Set the size of each dot
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the `RealFlutter` class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The `MaterialApp` widget is created, providing the basic structure of the app.
// 3. A `Scaffold` widget is used to create the app's visual layout, including an AppBar and a body.
// 4. In the body, a `Center` widget is used to center the `PinDot` widget on the screen.
// 5. The `PinDot` widget is configured with a length of 4, meaning it will display 4 dots for the PIN input.
// 6. The `onChanged` callback is defined to handle changes in the input, printing the entered PIN to the console.
// 7. The colors and size of the dots are customizable, enhancing the visual appeal of the input field.
