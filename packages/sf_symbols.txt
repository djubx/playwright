```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sf_symbols/sf_symbols.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'sf_symbols Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Centered Icon
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        // Set the title of the AppBar
        title: Text('sf_symbols Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        // Use the SFSymbols class to access the heart icon
        child: Icon(SFSymbols.heart),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The app starts by running the main function, which calls runApp with an instance of MyApp.
// MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title, theme, and home page.
// The home page is an instance of RealFlutter, which builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Centered Icon.
// The Icon is accessed using the SFSymbols class, which provides a set of icons designed by Apple.
```

// In summary, the code flows as follows:
// 1. The main function runs and calls runApp with an instance of MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title, theme, and home page.
// 3. The home page is an instance of RealFlutter, which builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Centered Icon.
// 4. The Icon is accessed using the SFSymbols class, which provides a set of icons designed by Apple.
