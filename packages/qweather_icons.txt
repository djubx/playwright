# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using qweather_icons

## Installation
To use the `qweather_icons` package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  qweather_icons: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your app requires internet access to fetch weather data. However, the `qweather_icons` package itself does not require any specific permissions.

## Using the Package
To use the icons in your Flutter application, you can import the package and utilize the icons as follows:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:qweather_icons/qweather_icons.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Weather Icons Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Display a sunny icon
              Icon(
                QWeatherIcons.sunny,
                size: 100,
                color: Colors.yellow,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Display a rainy icon
              Icon(
                QWeatherIcons.rainy,
                size: 100,
                color: Colors.blue,
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we import the `qweather_icons` package and use the `QWeatherIcons` class to display a sunny and a rainy icon. You can customize the size and color of the icons as needed.

              // Display a cloudy icon
              Icon(
                QWeatherIcons.cloudy, // Use the cloudy icon from qweather_icons
                size: 100, // Set the size of the icon
                color: Colors.grey, // Set the color of the icon
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}
```

// The application starts by running the RealFlutter widget.
// The MaterialApp widget provides the basic structure of the app.
// Inside the Scaffold, we have an AppBar with the title "Weather Icons Example".
// The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// A Column widget is used to arrange the icons vertically.
// Each Icon widget displays a different weather icon (sunny, rainy, cloudy) from the qweather_icons package.
// The size and color of each icon are customizable.
// The SizedBox widget is used to add space between the icons for better visual separation.
// Finally, the main function runs the RealFlutter app, displaying the weather icons on the screen.
