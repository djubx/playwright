# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Syncfusion Flutter Barcodes

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `syncfusion_flutter_barcodes` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  syncfusion_flutter_barcodes: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/syncfusion_flutter_barcodes).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:syncfusion_flutter_barcodes/barcodes.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Barcode Widget
You can now use the barcode widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a QR code:

```dart
SfBarcodeGenerator(
  value: 'https://www.example.com',
  symbology: QRCode(),
)
```

This widget generates a QR code that encodes the URL `https://www.example.com`.

## Step 5: Customizing the Barcode
You can customize the appearance of the barcode by modifying properties such as `background`, `foreground`, and `width`. For example:

```dart
SfBarcodeGenerator(
  value: '1234567890',
  symbology: Code128(),
  background: Colors.white,
  foreground: Colors.black,
  width: 2,
  height: 100,
)
```

This generates a Code 128 barcode with specified colors and dimensions.

With these steps, you can easily set up and start using the `syncfusion_flutter_barcodes` package in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Syncfusion Flutter Barcodes

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:syncfusion_flutter_barcodes/barcodes.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Syncfusion Barcodes Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Syncfusion Barcodes Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Generating a QR code
              SfBarcodeGenerator(
                value: 'https://www.example.com',
                symbology: QRCode(),
                // Customizing the QR code appearance
                background: Colors.white,
                foreground: Colors.black,
                width: 200,
                height: 200,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Generating a Code 128 barcode
              SfBarcodeGenerator(
                value: '1234567890',
                symbology: Code128(),
                // Customizing the Code 128 barcode appearance
                background: Colors.white,
                foreground: Colors.blue,
                width: 2,
                height: 100,
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The above code creates a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the Syncfusion Barcodes package.
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title "Syncfusion Barcodes Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child widgets.
// 5. A Column widget is used to arrange the QR code and Code 128 barcode vertically.
// 6. The first barcode generated is a QR code that encodes the URL "https://www.example.com".
// 7. The second barcode is a Code 128 barcode that encodes the value "1234567890".
// 8. Both barcodes are customized with background and foreground colors, as well as dimensions.
