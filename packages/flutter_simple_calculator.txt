# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_simple_calculator

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_simple_calculator` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_simple_calculator` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_simple_calculator: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the calculator in your app.

# Complete Example of flutter_simple_calculator

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_simple_calculator/flutter_simple_calculator.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyCalculatorApp());
}

class MyCalculatorApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Simple Calculator',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: CalculatorScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class CalculatorScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CalculatorScreenState createState() => _CalculatorScreenState();
}

class _CalculatorScreenState extends State<CalculatorScreen> {
  // Variable to hold the result of the calculation
  String result = "0";

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Simple Calculator'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: <Widget>[
          // Display the result
          Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(20.0),
            child: Text(
              result,
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 48, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
            ),
          ),
          // Calculator widget from the package
          Expanded(
            child: SimpleCalculator(
              onChanged: (value) {
                // Update the result when the calculator value changes
                setState(() {
                  result = value;
                });
              },
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp() with MyCalculatorApp.
// 2. MyCalculatorApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home screen is set to CalculatorScreen, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 4. In the CalculatorScreen, we maintain a state variable 'result' to display the calculation result.
// 5. The build method constructs the UI, including an AppBar and a display for the result.
// 6. The SimpleCalculator widget is included, which handles user input and calculations.
// 7. When the calculator value changes, the onChanged callback updates the 'result' state, triggering a UI refresh.
```
