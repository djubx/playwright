# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Text Gradiate

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the **text_gradiate** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  text_gradiate: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package
Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Package
You can now use the `TextGradiate` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:text_gradiate/text_gradiate.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Text Gradiate Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: TextGradiate(
            text: 'Gradient Text',
            gradient: LinearGradient(
              colors: [Colors.blue, Colors.purple],
              begin: Alignment.topLeft,
              end: Alignment.bottomRight,
            ),
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 40, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that displays gradient text in the center of the screen.

# Complete Example of Text Gradiate

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:text_gradiate/text_gradiate.dart';

// Main class of the Flutter application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      // Setting the title of the application
      title: 'Text Gradiate Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        // AppBar with a title
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Text Gradiate Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Centering the gradient text in the body
          child: TextGradiate(
            // The text to display
            text: 'Gradient Text',
            // Defining the gradient colors
            gradient: LinearGradient(
              colors: [Colors.blue, Colors.purple],
              begin: Alignment.topLeft,
              end: Alignment.bottomRight,
            ),
            // Text style configuration
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 40, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp, which is the root of the application.
3. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold widget is created, providing a structure for the app with an AppBar and a body.
4. The body contains a Center widget that centers its child, which is the TextGradiate widget.
5. The TextGradiate widget displays the text "Gradient Text" with a linear gradient from blue to purple.
6. The text is styled with a font size of 40 and bold weight, making it prominent on the screen.
