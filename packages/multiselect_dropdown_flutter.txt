# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Multiselect Dropdown Flutter

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `multiselect_dropdown_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  multiselect_dropdown_flutter: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:multiselect_dropdown_flutter/multiselect_dropdown_flutter.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

You can use the `MultiSelectDropdown` widget in your Flutter application as follows:

```dart
MultiSelectDropdown(
  items: [
    MultiSelectItem(value: 'Option 1', label: 'Option 1'),
    MultiSelectItem(value: 'Option 2', label: 'Option 2'),
    MultiSelectItem(value: 'Option 3', label: 'Option 3'),
  ],
  onChanged: (selectedItems) {
    // Handle the selected items
    print(selectedItems);
  },
)
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` if your dropdown interacts with location or other sensitive data. However, for basic usage, no additional configuration is required.

## Optimizations

- **Performance**: If you have a large number of items, consider implementing pagination or lazy loading to improve performance.
- **Styling**: Customize the dropdown to match your app's theme by using the available styling options in the package.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the `multiselect_dropdown_flutter` package effectively in your Flutter applications.

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Multiselect Dropdown Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Multiselect Dropdown Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: MultiSelectDropdownExample(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MultiSelectDropdownExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MultiSelectDropdownExampleState createState() => _MultiSelectDropdownExampleState();
}

class _MultiSelectDropdownExampleState extends State<MultiSelectDropdownExample> {
  // List to hold selected items
  List<String> selectedItems = [];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        // Display the selected items
        Text('Selected Items: ${selectedItems.join(', ')}'),
        SizedBox(height: 20),
        // MultiSelectDropdown widget
        MultiSelectDropdown(
          items: [
            MultiSelectItem(value: 'Option 1', label: 'Option 1'),
            MultiSelectItem(value: 'Option 2', label: 'Option 2'),
            MultiSelectItem(value: 'Option 3', label: 'Option 3'),
            MultiSelectItem(value: 'Option 4', label: 'Option 4'),
          ],
          onChanged: (List<String> items) {
            // Update the selected items state
            setState(() {
              selectedItems = items;
            });
          },
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds the MultiSelectDropdownExample.
// 4. MultiSelectDropdownExample is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of selected items.
// 5. The build method displays the selected items and the MultiSelectDropdown widget.
// 6. When the user selects or deselects options, the onChanged callback updates the selectedItems list.
// 7. The UI is rebuilt to reflect the current selection.
