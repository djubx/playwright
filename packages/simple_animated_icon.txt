# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Simple Animated Icon

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **simple_animated_icon** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  simple_animated_icon: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement an animated icon.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simple_animated_icon/simple_animated_icon.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Simple Animated Icon Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: SimpleAnimatedIcon(
            startIcon: Icons.play_arrow,
            endIcon: Icons.pause,
            size: 100.0,
            duration: Duration(milliseconds: 300),
            onTap: () {
              // Handle icon tap
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple app with a play/pause animated icon. The `SimpleAnimatedIcon` widget takes care of the animation when tapped.

# Complete Example of Simple Animated Icon

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simple_animated_icon/simple_animated_icon.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to track the state of the icon
  bool isPlaying = false;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Simple Animated Icon Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: GestureDetector(
            // Detects taps on the icon
            onTap: () {
              // Toggle the playing state
              setState(() {
                isPlaying = !isPlaying;
              });
            },
            child: SimpleAnimatedIcon(
              // Start icon when not playing
              startIcon: Icons.play_arrow,
              // End icon when playing
              endIcon: Icons.pause,
              // Size of the icon
              size: 100.0,
              // Duration of the animation
              duration: Duration(milliseconds: 300),
              // Color of the icon
              color: Colors.blue,
              // Animation will play when the state changes
              isPlaying: isPlaying,
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation

// The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` widget.
// The `RealFlutter` widget is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the icon (playing or paused).
// In the `build` method, we create a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// The Center widget holds a GestureDetector that listens for tap events.
// When the icon is tapped, the `onTap` callback toggles the `isPlaying` state.
// The `SimpleAnimatedIcon` widget displays either the play or pause icon based on the `isPlaying` state.
// The animation duration is set to 300 milliseconds, providing a smooth transition between icons.
// The icon size is set to 100.0, and the color is set to blue, making it visually appealing.
// This simple structure allows for easy integration of animated icons into any Flutter application.

In summary, the **simple_animated_icon** package provides a straightforward way to add animated icons to your Flutter applications. By following the setup and usage instructions, you can enhance your app's interactivity and user experience with minimal effort.
