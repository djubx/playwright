# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_sliding_up_panel

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_sliding_up_panel` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_sliding_up_panel` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_sliding_up_panel: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Basic Setup

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple application that demonstrates how to use the sliding panel.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_sliding_up_panel/flutter_sliding_up_panel.dart';
```

2. Create a StatefulWidget that will contain the sliding panel.

3. Use the `SlidingUpPanel` widget to create the panel and define its content.

### Example Code Structure

In the next section, we will provide a complete example of a Flutter application using the `flutter_sliding_up_panel` package.

# Complete Example of flutter_sliding_up_panel

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_sliding_up_panel/flutter_sliding_up_panel.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sliding Up Panel Demo',
      home: SlidingUpPanelDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class SlidingUpPanelDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SlidingUpPanelDemoState createState() => _SlidingUpPanelDemoState();
}

class _SlidingUpPanelDemoState extends State<SlidingUpPanelDemo> {
  // Create a PanelController to control the sliding panel
  final PanelController _panelController = PanelController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Sliding Up Panel Example'),
      ),
      body: Stack(
        children: <Widget>[
          // Main content of the app
          Center(
            child: ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Open the sliding panel when the button is pressed
                _panelController.open();
              },
              child: Text('Open Panel'),
            ),
          ),
          // SlidingUpPanel widget
          SlidingUpPanel(
            controller: _panelController,
            panel: _panelContent(), // Content of the sliding panel
            body: _mainContent(), // Main content of the app
            minHeight: 100, // Minimum height of the panel
            maxHeight: 400, // Maximum height of the panel
            border: Border(top: BorderSide(color: Colors.grey, width: 1)),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }

  // Widget for the main content
  Widget _mainContent() {
    return Center(
      child: Text(
        'Main Content Area',
        style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Widget for the sliding panel content
  Widget _panelContent() {
    return Center(
      child: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: <Widget>[
          Text(
            'Sliding Panel Content',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20),
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Close the sliding panel when the button is pressed
              _panelController.close();
            },
            child: Text('Close Panel'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and home set to SlidingUpPanelDemo.
// 3. SlidingUpPanelDemo is a StatefulWidget that manages the state of the sliding panel.
// 4. A PanelController is created to control the sliding panel's open and close actions.
// 5. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Stack containing the main content and the sliding panel.
// 6. The main content has a button that opens the sliding panel when pressed.
// 7. The SlidingUpPanel widget is configured with a minimum and maximum height, and it contains the main content and the panel content.
// 8. The panel content includes a button to close the panel, demonstrating the interaction with the PanelController.
```
