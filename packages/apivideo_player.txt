# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `apivideo_player`

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `apivideo_player` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `apivideo_player` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  apivideo_player: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. Ensure that your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in `ios/Podfile`:

   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in a Flutter application.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

   ```dart
   import 'package:apivideo_player/apivideo_player.dart';
   ```

2. Create a simple video player widget:

   ```dart
   class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return Scaffold(
         appBar: AppBar(title: Text('API Video Player')),
         body: Center(
           child: ApiVideoPlayer(
             videoId: 'your_video_id', // Replace with your video ID
             autoPlay: true,
           ),
         ),
       );
     }
   }
   ```

3. Run your application to see the video player in action.

By following these steps, you can successfully integrate the `apivideo_player` package into your Flutter application, enabling video playback capabilities with ease.

# Complete Example of `apivideo_player`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:apivideo_player/apivideo_player.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'API Video Player Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('API Video Player')),
      body: Center(
        child: ApiVideoPlayer(
          videoId: 'your_video_id', // Replace with your video ID
          autoPlay: true, // Automatically play the video
          onVideoEnded: () {
            // Callback when the video ends
            print('Video has ended');
          },
          onError: (error) {
            // Handle any errors during playback
            print('Error occurred: $error');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme, and specifies RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget containing the ApiVideoPlayer.
// 4. The ApiVideoPlayer is configured with a video ID and set to auto-play.
// 5. Callbacks for video end and error handling are provided to manage playback events.
// 6. When the app runs, the video player will display and start playing the specified video automatically.
```
