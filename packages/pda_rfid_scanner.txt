# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the `pda_rfid_scanner` Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `pda_rfid_scanner` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  pda_rfid_scanner: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
   ```

2. **Minimum SDK Version**: Ensure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

   ```xml
   <key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
   <string>This app requires Bluetooth access to scan RFID tags.</string>
   ```

2. **Deployment Target**: Ensure your deployment target is set to at least iOS 10.0 in `ios/Podfile`:

   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have configured your project, you can start using the `pda_rfid_scanner` package in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement RFID scanning.

# Complete Example of Using the `pda_rfid_scanner` Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pda_rfid_scanner/pda_rfid_scanner.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String scannedData = "No data scanned yet"; // Variable to hold scanned data

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the RFID scanner
    PdaRfidScanner.initScanner();
  }

  // Function to start scanning
  void startScanning() async {
    // Start the scanning process
    String result = await PdaRfidScanner.startScan();
    setState(() {
      scannedData = result; // Update the scanned data
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('RFID Scanner Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text(scannedData), // Display scanned data
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: startScanning, // Start scanning on button press
                child: Text('Scan RFID'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget, we initialize the RFID scanner in the initState method.
// 3. The startScanning function is called when the user presses the "Scan RFID" button.
// 4. This function invokes the startScan method from the pda_rfid_scanner package, which starts the scanning process.
// 5. Once a tag is scanned, the result is stored in the scannedData variable and displayed on the screen.
```

## Summary

In this blog, we explored the `pda_rfid_scanner` Flutter package, detailing its features and use cases. We walked through the setup process, including platform-specific configurations for Android and iOS. Finally, we provided a complete example of a Flutter application that demonstrates how to use the package effectively. The application initializes the RFID scanner, allows users to scan RFID tags, and displays the scanned data in real-time. This package is a valuable tool for developers looking to integrate RFID scanning capabilities into their Flutter applications.
