## Part 2: Tutorial

<!-- START_TUTORIAL -->
# Setting Up the Tencent Kit Flutter Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `tencent_kit` package and demonstrate how to use its features effectively.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `tencent_kit` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  tencent_kit: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.yourapp">

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
    
    <application
        ...
        android:usesCleartextTraffic="true">
        ...
    </application>
</manifest>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. Ensure your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your Flutter application. 

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:tencent_kit/tencent_kit.dart';
```

2. Initialize the Tencent Kit in your main application file:

```dart
void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  TencentKit.initialize(appId: 'YOUR_TENCENT_APP_ID');
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

3. Use the features provided by the package, such as user authentication or messaging.

This setup will allow you to leverage Tencent's services in your Flutter application effectively.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
# Complete Example of Using Tencent Kit

Below is a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the `tencent_kit` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tencent_kit/tencent_kit.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  // Initialize Tencent Kit with your app ID
  TencentKit.initialize(appId: 'YOUR_TENCENT_APP_ID');
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Tencent Kit Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomePageState createState() => _HomePageState();
}

class _HomePageState extends State<HomePage> {
  String _message = '';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Tencent Kit Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Message: $_message'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _sendMessage,
              child: Text('Send Message'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to send a message using Tencent Kit
  void _sendMessage() async {
    // Simulate sending a message
    String response = await TencentKit.sendMessage('Hello from Tencent Kit!');
    setState(() {
      _message = response; // Update the message state
    });
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, initializing Tencent Kit with the app ID.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. The HomePage widget is displayed as the home screen.
// 4. The HomePage contains a button to send a message.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the _sendMessage function is called.
// 6. This function uses TencentKit to send a message and updates the UI with the response.
```
