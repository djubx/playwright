# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `add_to_cart_animation`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `add_to_cart_animation` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  add_to_cart_animation: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # Ensure this is set to at least 10.0
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `add_to_cart_animation` in your app.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:add_to_cart_animation/add_to_cart_animation.dart';
```

2. Use the `AddToCartAnimation` widget in your widget tree. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
AddToCartAnimation(
  animationDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 500),
  child: IconButton(
    icon: Icon(Icons.add_shopping_cart),
    onPressed: () {
      // Trigger the add to cart animation
    },
  ),
);
```

This setup will allow you to trigger the animation when the user taps the button.

# Complete Example of `add_to_cart_animation`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:add_to_cart_animation/add_to_cart_animation.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Add to Cart Animation Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Add to Cart Animation'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: AddToCartAnimation(
          animationDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 500), // Duration of the animation
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Trigger the animation when the button is pressed
              // This is where you would typically add the item to the cart
              print('Item added to cart!');
            },
            child: Text('Add to Cart'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and runs MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. HomeScreen contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, the AddToCartAnimation widget wraps an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, it triggers the animation and prints a message to the console.
// 6. The animation provides visual feedback to the user, indicating that the item has been added to the cart.
