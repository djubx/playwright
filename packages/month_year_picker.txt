# Complete Example of Month Year Picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:month_year_picker/month_year_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Month Year Picker Example',
      home: MonthYearPickerExample(),
    );
  }
}

class MonthYearPickerExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MonthYearPickerExampleState createState() => _MonthYearPickerExampleState();
}

class _MonthYearPickerExampleState extends State<MonthYearPickerExample> {
  DateTime? selectedDate; // Variable to hold the selected date

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Month Year Picker Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the selected date or a prompt
            Text(
              selectedDate == null
                  ? 'No date selected'
                  : 'Selected Date: ${selectedDate!.month}/${selectedDate!.year}',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () async {
                // Show the Month Year Picker dialog
                final DateTime? pickedDate = await showMonthYearPicker(
                  context: context,
                  initialDate: DateTime.now(),
                  firstDate: DateTime(2000),
                  lastDate: DateTime(2100),
                );

                // Update the state with the selected date
                if (pickedDate != null) {
                  setState(() {
                    selectedDate = pickedDate;
                  });
                }
              },
              child: Text('Select Month and Year'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget.
// 3. The MonthYearPickerExample widget is a stateful widget that manages the selected date.
// 4. In the build method, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. The Center widget contains a Column that displays the selected date and a button.
// 6. When the button is pressed, the Month Year Picker dialog is shown.
// 7. If a date is selected, the state is updated, and the selected date is displayed on the screen.
