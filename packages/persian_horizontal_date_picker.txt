            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(
              'Selected Date: ${_selectedDate.toString()}',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the application and is presented with a horizontal date picker.
// 2. The user selects a date from the date picker.
// 3. The selected date is displayed below the date picker.
// 4. The user can select a different date from the date picker, and the displayed date will update accordingly.

// In summary, this code creates a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the Persian Horizontal Date Picker package.
// The application displays a horizontal date picker and allows the user to select a date.
// The selected date is then displayed below the date picker.
