# Exploring the Searchbase Flutter Package

The **Searchbase** package is a powerful tool designed to enhance search functionalities in Flutter applications. It provides a seamless way to integrate search capabilities, allowing developers to create intuitive and responsive search experiences for their users. 

## When to Use Searchbase
You might consider using Searchbase when:
- You need to implement a search feature in your app that can handle large datasets.
- You want to provide users with real-time search suggestions as they type.
- You require advanced filtering and sorting options for search results.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Search**: Searchbase allows for instant search results as users type, improving user experience.
- **Customizable UI**: The package provides flexibility in designing the search interface to match your app's theme.
- **Integration with APIs**: Easily connect to various data sources, including RESTful APIs, to fetch search results.
- **Filtering and Sorting**: Implement complex filtering and sorting mechanisms to refine search results based on user preferences.

Overall, Searchbase is an excellent choice for developers looking to implement robust search functionalities in their Flutter applications.

# Setting Up and Using the Searchbase Package

## Installation
To get started with the Searchbase package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and include the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  searchbase: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/searchbase).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file, depending on your app's requirements. For example, if you are accessing the internet, ensure you have:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
Once you have installed the package and configured your project, you can start using Searchbase in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a search feature:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:searchbase/searchbase.dart';
```

2. Create an instance of the `Searchbase` class and configure it with your data source.

3. Use the `Searchbase` widget to build your search interface.

This setup will allow you to create a functional search feature in your app. For more advanced configurations and options, refer to the official documentation.

# Complete Example of Using Searchbase

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:searchbase/searchbase.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Searchbase Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Create a Searchbase instance
  late Searchbase searchbase;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize Searchbase with your API endpoint
    searchbase = Searchbase(
      url: 'https://your-api-endpoint.com/search',
      // Additional configurations can be added here
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Searchbase Example'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Search input field
          Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
            child: TextField(
              onChanged: (query) {
                // Trigger search on text change
                searchbase.search(query);
              },
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Search',
                border: OutlineInputBorder(),
              ),
            ),
          ),
          // Display search results
          Expanded(
            child: StreamBuilder<List<SearchResult>>(
              stream: searchbase.resultsStream,
              builder: (context, snapshot) {
                if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                  return Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
                }
                if (!snapshot.hasData || snapshot.data!.isEmpty) {
                  return Center(child: Text('No results found.'));
                }
                // List of search results
                return ListView.builder(
                  itemCount: snapshot.data!.length,
                  itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                    final result = snapshot.data![index];
                    return ListTile(
                      title: Text(result.title), // Assuming result has a title property
                      subtitle: Text(result.description), // Assuming result has a description property
                    );
                  },
                );
              },
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home as RealFlutter.
// 3. In RealFlutter, we initialize a Searchbase instance with an API endpoint.
// 4. The UI consists of a TextField for user input and a ListView to display results.
// 5. As the user types in the TextField, the onChanged callback triggers a search query.
// 6. The StreamBuilder listens for search results and updates the ListView accordingly.
// 7. If there are no results, a message is displayed; otherwise, the results are shown in a list.
