# Geotypes Flutter Package: A Comprehensive Overview

The **geotypes** package is a powerful Flutter library designed to handle geographical data types, making it easier for developers to work with geographic coordinates, points, and polygons. This package is particularly useful in applications that require mapping, location services, or any functionality that involves geographical data manipulation.

## When to Use Geotypes
You might consider using the **geotypes** package in scenarios such as:
- Building mapping applications that require precise location data.
- Developing location-based services that need to calculate distances or areas.
- Handling geographical data in applications that involve GIS (Geographic Information Systems).

## Key Features
- **Support for Geographic Coordinates**: Easily manage latitude and longitude values.
- **Point and Polygon Handling**: Create and manipulate points and polygons for mapping purposes.
- **Distance Calculations**: Calculate distances between geographical points.
- **Area Calculations**: Compute the area of polygons defined by a series of points.

With these features, the **geotypes** package simplifies the process of working with geographical data in Flutter applications.

# Setting Up and Using the Geotypes Package

## Installation
To get started with the **geotypes** package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  geotypes: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/geotypes).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable location services in your `Info.plist` file by adding the following keys:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show nearby places.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to provide better services.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
Once the package is installed and configured, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a point and calculate the distance between two geographical coordinates.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:geotypes/geotypes.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Geotypes Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Geotypes Package in Action!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we set up a basic Flutter application. You can expand this by adding more functionality using the **geotypes** package.

# Complete Example of Using Geotypes

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:geotypes/geotypes.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Geotypes Example')),
        body: GeotypesDemo(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class GeotypesDemo extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Define two geographical points
    final point1 = GeoPoint(latitude: 37.7749, longitude: -122.4194); // San Francisco
    final point2 = GeoPoint(latitude: 34.0522, longitude: -118.2437); // Los Angeles

    // Calculate the distance between the two points
    final distance = point1.distanceTo(point2); // Distance in meters

    // Define a polygon using a list of points
    final polygon = GeoPolygon([
      GeoPoint(latitude: 37.7749, longitude: -122.4194),
      GeoPoint(latitude: 37.7849, longitude: -122.4294),
      GeoPoint(latitude: 37.7949, longitude: -122.4194),
    ]);

    // Calculate the area of the polygon
    final area = polygon.area(); // Area in square meters

    return Center(
      child: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: [
          Text('Distance from SF to LA: ${distance.toStringAsFixed(2)} meters'),
          Text('Area of Polygon: ${area.toStringAsFixed(2)} square meters'),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and the GeotypesDemo widget.
// 3. In GeotypesDemo, two geographical points are defined: point1 (San Francisco) and point2 (Los Angeles).
// 4. The distance between these two points is calculated using the distanceTo method.
// 5. A polygon is defined using a list of GeoPoint objects.
// 6. The area of the polygon is calculated using the area method.
// 7. Finally, the distance and area are displayed in the center of the screen.
