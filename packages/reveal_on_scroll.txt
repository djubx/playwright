# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `reveal_on_scroll`

## Installation
To get started with the `reveal_on_scroll` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  reveal_on_scroll: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your app requires any specific capabilities. However, the `reveal_on_scroll` package does not require any special permissions.

## Basic Usage
To use the `reveal_on_scroll` package, you need to wrap your widgets with the `RevealOnScroll` widget. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:reveal_on_scroll/reveal_on_scroll.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Reveal on Scroll Example')),
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: 20,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return RevealOnScroll(
            child: Container(
              height: 100,
              margin: EdgeInsets.all(10),
              color: Colors.blue[(index % 9 + 1) * 100],
              child: Center(child: Text('Item $index')),
            ),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, each item in the list will reveal itself as the user scrolls down.

# Complete Example of `reveal_on_scroll`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:reveal_on_scroll/reveal_on_scroll.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Reveal on Scroll Example')),
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: 20, // Total number of items in the list
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return RevealOnScroll(
            // Wrap each item with RevealOnScroll to enable the reveal effect
            child: Container(
              height: 100, // Height of each item
              margin: EdgeInsets.all(10), // Margin around each item
              color: Colors.blue[(index % 9 + 1) * 100], // Dynamic color for each item
              child: Center(child: Text('Item $index')), // Centered text in each item
            ),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. A Scaffold widget is created with an AppBar and a ListView as the body.
// 3. The ListView.builder creates a scrollable list of items.
// 4. For each item, the RevealOnScroll widget is used to wrap the Container.
// 5. Each Container has a fixed height, margin, and a dynamic background color based on the index.
// 6. As the user scrolls down, each item will reveal itself with a smooth animation.
