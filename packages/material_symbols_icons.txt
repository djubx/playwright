       sdk: flutter
     material_symbols_icons: ^1.0.0
   ```

2. **Install Package**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the package.

   ```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

- Ensure your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to support the latest Material Design components.

# Complete Example: Using `material_symbols_icons` in a Flutter App

Below is a complete example of a Flutter application that demonstrates the key features of the `material_symbols_icons` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:material_symbols_icons/material_symbols_icons.dart';

// Main entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// RealFlutter is the main class of the application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Material Symbols Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: IconDemoPage(),
    );
  }
}

// IconDemoPage is a stateful widget that displays a list of icons
class IconDemoPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _IconDemoPageState createState() => _IconDemoPageState();
}

class _IconDemoPageState extends State<IconDemoPage> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Material Symbols Icons'),
      ),
      body: ListView(
        children: <Widget>[
          // Display a home icon
          ListTile(
            leading: Icon(MaterialSymbols.home, size: 30.0, color: Colors.red),
            title: Text('Home Icon'),
          ),
          // Display a search icon
          ListTile(
            leading: Icon(MaterialSymbols.search, size: 30.0, color: Colors.green),
            title: Text('Search Icon'),
          ),
          // Display a settings icon
          ListTile(
            leading: Icon(MaterialSymbols.settings, size: 30.0, color: Colors.blue),
            title: Text('Settings Icon'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// Application Flow Explanation
// The application starts with the `main` function, which calls `runApp` with `RealFlutter`.
// `RealFlutter` is a stateless widget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// The home of the MaterialApp is `IconDemoPage`, a stateful widget.
// `IconDemoPage` builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a ListView.
// The ListView contains ListTiles, each with a leading icon from the `material_symbols_icons` package.
// Each icon is displayed with a specific size and color, demonstrating customization options.
