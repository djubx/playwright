# Setup and Usage Tutorial for flutter_savanitdev_printer

## Installation
To get started with the `flutter_savanitdev_printer` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_savanitdev_printer: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_savanitdev_printer).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request permission for Bluetooth usage:

```xml
<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires Bluetooth access to connect to printers.</string>
<key>NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires Bluetooth access to connect to printers.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_savanitdev_printer/flutter_savanitdev_printer.dart';
```

You can then create an instance of the printer and use its methods to print documents or images. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to print a text document:

```dart
void printDocument() async {
  final printer = RealFlutterPrinter();
  await printer.connect(); // Connect to the printer
  await printer.printText("Hello, World!"); // Print text
  await printer.disconnect(); // Disconnect from the printer
}
```

This function connects to the printer, prints "Hello, World!", and then disconnects.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and start using the `flutter_savanitdev_printer` package in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of flutter_savanitdev_printer

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_savanitdev_printer/flutter_savanitdev_printer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Printer Example',
      home: PrinterHome(),
    );
  }
}

class PrinterHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PrinterHomeState createState() => _PrinterHomeState();
}

class _PrinterHomeState extends State<PrinterHome> {
  final RealFlutterPrinter printer = RealFlutterPrinter(); // Create an instance of the printer

  // Function to connect to the printer and print a document
  void _print() async {
    try {
      await printer.connect(); // Connect to the printer
      await printer.printText("Hello from RealFlutter!"); // Print text
      await printer.disconnect(); // Disconnect from the printer
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(SnackBar(content: Text("Printed successfully!"))); // Show success message
    } catch (e) {
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(SnackBar(content: Text("Failed to print: $e"))); // Show error message
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Printer Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _print, // Call the print function when the button is pressed
          child: Text('Print Document'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget (PrinterHome).
// 3. PrinterHome is a stateful widget that manages the printing process.
// 4. When the user presses the "Print Document" button, the _print function is called.
// 5. Inside _print, the app attempts to connect to the printer.
// 6. If successful, it prints the text "Hello from RealFlutter!".
// 7. After printing, it disconnects from the printer and shows a success message.
// 8. If any error occurs during the process, an error message is displayed instead.
