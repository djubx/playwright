# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_native_html_to_pdf

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_native_html_to_pdf` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_native_html_to_pdf: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_native_html_to_pdf).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure that you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    compileSdkVersion 31 // or latest
    ...
}

dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'com.github.barteksc:android-pdf-viewer:3.2.0-beta.1' // or latest
}
```

2. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save PDFs.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to scan documents.</string>
```

2. Ensure that you have the correct deployment target set in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0' # or latest
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to convert HTML to PDF.

# Complete Example of flutter_native_html_to_pdf

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_native_html_to_pdf/flutter_native_html_to_pdf.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'HTML to PDF Example',
      home: PDFGeneratorScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PDFGeneratorScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PDFGeneratorScreenState createState() => _PDFGeneratorScreenState();
}

class _PDFGeneratorScreenState extends State<PDFGeneratorScreen> {
  // Function to generate PDF from HTML
  Future<void> _generatePDF() async {
    // Define the HTML content
    String htmlContent = """
      <h1>Invoice</h1>
      <p>This is a sample invoice generated from HTML.</p>
      <p>Thank you for your business!</p>
    """;

    // Generate PDF
    String pdfPath = await FlutterNativeHtmlToPdf.convertFromHtml(
      htmlContent,
      "Invoice",
      "invoice.pdf",
      // Optional: Specify the directory to save the PDF
      directory: "/storage/emulated/0/Download/",
    );

    // Show a message when PDF is generated
    ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
      SnackBar(content: Text('PDF generated at: $pdfPath')),
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('HTML to PDF Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _generatePDF,
          child: Text('Generate PDF'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. PDFGeneratorScreen is a StatefulWidget that contains the logic for generating the PDF.
// 4. When the user presses the "Generate PDF" button, the _generatePDF function is called.
// 5. Inside _generatePDF, HTML content is defined, and the FlutterNativeHtmlToPdf.convertFromHtml method is called to generate the PDF.
// 6. The generated PDF path is displayed using a SnackBar to inform the user of the successful operation.
```

// The above code demonstrates how to create a simple Flutter application that converts HTML content into a PDF file. The application consists of a button that, when pressed, generates a PDF from the specified HTML content and saves it to the device's storage. The user is then notified of the PDF's location via a SnackBar message.
