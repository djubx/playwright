# Tutorial: Setting Up the Number Pad Keyboard

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To use the **number_pad_keyboard** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  number_pad_keyboard: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install the Package
Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions if your app requires internet access or other features. Typically, no additional configuration is needed for the number pad itself.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least iOS 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Import the Package
In your Dart file where you want to use the number pad, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:number_pad_keyboard/number_pad_keyboard.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Number Pad
You can now use the `NumberPadKeyboard` widget in your application. Here’s a simple example of how to integrate it into your app:

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Number Pad Example')),
    body: Center(
      child: NumberPadKeyboard(
        onPressed: (value) {
          // Handle the numeric input here
          print('Button pressed: $value');
        },
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

This code snippet creates a basic application with a number pad that prints the value of the button pressed to the console.

# Complete Example of Number Pad Keyboard

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:number_pad_keyboard/number_pad_keyboard.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Number Pad Keyboard Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: NumberPadHome(),
    );
  }
}

class NumberPadHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _NumberPadHomeState createState() => _NumberPadHomeState();
}

class _NumberPadHomeState extends State<NumberPadHome> {
  String input = ''; // Variable to hold the input from the number pad

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Number Pad Example')),
      body: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: [
          // Display the current input
          Text(
            'Input: $input',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20),
          // Number pad keyboard
          NumberPadKeyboard(
            onPressed: (value) {
              // Update the input variable with the pressed value
              setState(() {
                input += value; // Append the pressed value to the input string
              });
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home screen is set to NumberPadHome, which is a stateful widget.
// 4. In NumberPadHome, we maintain a string variable 'input' to keep track of the user's input.
// 5. The build method displays the current input and the number pad keyboard.
// 6. When a button on the number pad is pressed, the onPressed callback is triggered.
// 7. The pressed value is appended to the 'input' string, and the UI is updated using setState.
// 8. The updated input is displayed on the screen, allowing users to see their input in real-time.
```
