You might consider using the **flutter_poolakey** package in scenarios such as:

- **Secure Key Management**: When your application requires secure storage and retrieval of keys for accessing APIs or services.
- **Dynamic Key Generation**: If your application needs to generate keys dynamically based on user input or other parameters.
- **Multi-Platform Support**: When you want a consistent way to manage keys across both Android and iOS platforms.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Secure Storage**: Utilizes platform-specific secure storage mechanisms to ensure that keys are stored safely.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that allows for quick integration into existing Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_poolakey

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **flutter_poolakey** package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **flutter_poolakey** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_poolakey: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, you need to ensure that your app has the necessary permissions to access secure storage. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located in `android/app/src/main/` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add specific configurations in your `Info.plist` file located in `ios/Runner/`. Ensure you have the following entries:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to create, store, and retrieve a pool key.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_poolakey/flutter_poolakey.dart';
```

2. Initialize the `RealFlutter` class and use its methods to manage keys.

```dart
class RealFlutter {
  // Method to create and store a key
  Future<void> createKey(String key) async {
    await Poolakey.storeKey(key);
  }

  // Method to retrieve a key
  Future<String?> retrieveKey() async {
    return await Poolakey.retrieveKey();
  }
}
```

With these steps, you are now ready to manage pool keys in your Flutter application using the **flutter_poolakey** package.

# Complete Example of flutter_poolakey

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_poolakey/flutter_poolakey.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Poolakey Example',
      home: KeyManagementScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class KeyManagementScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _KeyManagementScreenState createState() => _KeyManagementScreenState();
}

class _KeyManagementScreenState extends State<KeyManagementScreen> {
  final RealFlutter _realFlutter = RealFlutter();
  String _key = '';
  String _retrievedKey = '';

  // Method to handle key creation
  void _createKey() async {
    await _realFlutter.createKey(_key);
    setState(() {
      _retrievedKey = 'Key stored successfully!';
    });
  }

  // Method to handle key retrieval
  void _retrieveKey() async {
    String? key = await _realFlutter.retrieveKey();
    setState(() {
      _retrievedKey = key ?? 'No key found!';
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Key Management'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              onChanged: (value) {
                _key = value; // Update the key value
              },
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter Key'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _createKey,
              child: Text('Store Key'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _retrieveKey,
              child: Text('Retrieve Key'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(_retrievedKey), // Display the retrieved key or message
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter {
  // Method to create and store a key
  Future<void> createKey(String key) async {
    await Poolakey.storeKey(key); // Store the key securely
  }

  // Method to retrieve a key
  Future<String?> retrieveKey() async {
    return await Poolakey.retrieveKey(); // Retrieve the stored key
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The KeyManagementScreen is displayed, allowing users to input a key.
// 3. Users can enter a key in the TextField and press 'Store Key' to save it.
// 4. The _createKey method is called, which uses the RealFlutter class to store the key.
// 5. Users can press 'Retrieve Key' to fetch the stored key.
// 6. The _retrieveKey method is called, which retrieves the key and updates the UI accordingly.
