# Algorithmic Flutter Package
================================

The algorithmic Flutter package is a powerful tool for simplifying complex algorithms and data structures in Flutter applications. It provides a set of pre-built algorithms and data structures that can be easily integrated into any Flutter project, making it an ideal choice for developers who want to focus on building their app's UI and business logic without worrying about the underlying algorithms.

## When to Use This Package
---------------------------

This package is particularly useful when:

* You need to implement complex algorithms such as sorting, searching, or graph traversal in your Flutter app.
* You want to optimize your app's performance by using efficient data structures such as binary search trees or heaps.
* You need to solve problems that involve combinatorics, probability, or statistics.

## Features
------------

The algorithmic Flutter package includes a wide range of features, including:

* Sorting algorithms: bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, and more.
* Searching algorithms: linear search, binary search, and more.
* Graph algorithms: depth-first search, breadth-first search, Dijkstra's algorithm, and more.
* Data structures: arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and more.

# Setting Up the Package
-------------------------

To use the algorithmic Flutter package in your project, follow these steps:

1. Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  algorithmic: ^1.0.0
```
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.
3. Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:algorithmic/algorithmic.dart';
```

## Platform-Specific Details
---------------------------

The algorithmic Flutter package is designed to work on both Android and iOS platforms. However, some algorithms may have platform-specific optimizations or configurations.

For example, on Android, you can use the `AndroidAlgorithmic` class to access Android-specific algorithms and data structures. Similarly, on iOS, you can use the `IOSAlgorithmic` class to access iOS-specific algorithms and data structures.

## Required Configurations or Optimizations
------------------------------------------

Some algorithms may require additional configurations or optimizations to work efficiently. For example, some sorting algorithms may require a custom comparator function to sort objects correctly.

Be sure to check the documentation for each algorithm or data structure to see if any additional configurations or optimizations are required.
