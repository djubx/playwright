# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `flutter_gradient_animation_text`

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up and using the `flutter_gradient_animation_text` package in a Flutter project. We will cover platform-specific configurations for both Android and iOS.

## Setup Process

1. **Add Dependency**

   First, add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     flutter_gradient_animation_text: ^1.0.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**

   Run the following command to install the new package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Android Configuration**

   Ensure your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

   ```gradle
   android {
       defaultConfig {
           minSdkVersion 21
       }
   }
   ```

4. **iOS Configuration**

   Make sure your iOS deployment target is set to 9.0 or higher in `ios/Podfile`:

   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '9.0'
   ```

## Using the Package

To use the `flutter_gradient_animation_text` package, import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_gradient_animation_text/flutter_gradient_animation_text.dart';
```

You can then use the `RealFlutter` class to create animated gradient text:

```dart
RealFlutter(
  text: 'Hello, Flutter!',
  gradientColors: [Colors.blue, Colors.red],
  duration: Duration(seconds: 3),
  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 40, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
)
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_gradient_animation_text/flutter_gradient_animation_text.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Gradient Animation Text Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: GradientTextDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class GradientTextDemo extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Gradient Animation Text'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: RealFlutter(
          // The text to display with gradient animation
          text: 'Welcome to Flutter!',
          // Define the gradient colors for the animation
          gradientColors: [Colors.purple, Colors.orange, Colors.pink],
          // Set the duration of the animation
          duration: Duration(seconds: 5),
          // Customize the text style
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 50, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The application starts by running the `MyApp` class.
// `MyApp` is a stateless widget that sets up the MaterialApp.
// The MaterialApp uses `GradientTextDemo` as its home widget.
// `GradientTextDemo` is a stateless widget that builds a Scaffold.
// The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget.
// Inside the Center widget, the `RealFlutter` widget is used to display animated gradient text.
// The `RealFlutter` widget takes parameters like `text`, `gradientColors`, `duration`, and `style`.
// The gradient animation smoothly transitions between the specified colors over the given duration.
