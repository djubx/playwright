   ```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

```

## Basic Usage

To use `fancy_containers`, you can import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:fancy_containers/fancy_containers.dart';
```

You can then create a simple container using the `FancyContainer` widget:

```dart
FancyContainer(
  height: 200,
  width: 200,
  color: Colors.blue,
  borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(20),
  elevation: 5,
  shadowColor: Colors.black54,
  child: Center(child: Text('Hello, Fancy!')),
);
```

This code creates a blue container with rounded corners and a shadow effect.

# Complete Example of `fancy_containers`

Here is a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the `fancy_containers` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fancy_containers/fancy_containers.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Fancy Containers Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Fancy Containers Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(

            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [

              FancyContainer(
                height: 150,
                width: 150,
                gradient: LinearGradient(

                ),
                borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(30),
                elevation: 10,
                shadowColor: Colors.black54,
                child: Center(
                  child: Text(
                    'Gradient Container',
                    style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
                  ),
                ),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Creating a FancyContainer with a solid color
              FancyContainer(
                height: 150,
                width: 150,
                color: Colors.green,
                borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(30),
                elevation: 5,
                shadowColor: Colors.black54,
                child: Center(
                  child: Text(
                    'Solid Color Container',
                    style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
                  ),
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```
// The main function initializes the app and runs the RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// Inside the MaterialApp, we have a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// The Center widget contains a Column that vertically aligns its children.
// The first child is a FancyContainer with a gradient background, rounded corners, and a shadow.
// The second child is another FancyContainer with a solid green color, also with rounded corners and a shadow.
// Each container has centered text to display its purpose.
