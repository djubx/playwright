# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_progressed_play_button

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `flutter_progressed_play_button` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_progressed_play_button: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable background audio capabilities if your application requires it. Open your `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode, navigate to the project settings, and enable the "Background Modes" capability. Check the "Audio, AirPlay, and Picture in Picture" option.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `RealFlutter` class with the `flutter_progressed_play_button`.

# Complete Example of flutter_progressed_play_button

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_progressed_play_button/flutter_progressed_play_button.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to track the current playback progress
  double _progress = 0.0;
  // Variable to track whether the media is playing
  bool _isPlaying = false;

  // Function to simulate media playback
  void _togglePlayPause() {
    setState(() {
      _isPlaying = !_isPlaying; // Toggle play state
    });

    // Simulate progress update
    if (_isPlaying) {
      _startProgress();
    }
  }

  // Function to update progress over time
  void _startProgress() {
    // Reset progress when starting
    _progress = 0.0;
    // Update progress every second
    Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1), () {
      if (_isPlaying && _progress < 1.0) {
        setState(() {
          _progress += 0.1; // Increment progress
        });
        _startProgress(); // Continue updating
      }
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Progressed Play Button Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ProgressedPlayButton(
            // Set the current progress
            progress: _progress,
            // Set the play/pause state
            isPlaying: _isPlaying,
            // Callback for play/pause button
            onPressed: _togglePlayPause,
            // Customize the button appearance
            color: Colors.blue,
            size: 100.0,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of playback progress and play status.
// 3. The _togglePlayPause function toggles the play state and starts updating the progress if playing.
// 4. The _startProgress function updates the progress every second until it reaches 1.0 or playback is paused.
// 5. The ProgressedPlayButton widget displays the current progress and play state, allowing user interaction.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, the `RealFlutter` class demonstrates how to implement a play button with progress tracking. The application flow is straightforward: it initializes the play button, toggles play/pause states, and updates the progress accordingly. The comments within the code provide a step-by-step explanation of how the application operates, making it easy to understand and modify for your own use cases.
