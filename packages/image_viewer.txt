# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Image Viewer Package

## Installation
To get started with the `image_viewer` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  image_viewer: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/image_viewer).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you are loading images from the internet. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to display images.</string>
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Using the Package
Once you have installed the package and configured your project, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `image_viewer` package.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:image_viewer/image_viewer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Image Viewer Example',
      home: ImageViewerExample(),
    );
  }
}

class ImageViewerExample extends StatelessWidget {
  // Sample image URL
  final String imageUrl = 'https://example.com/sample-image.jpg';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Image Viewer Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // When the button is pressed, navigate to the image viewer
            Navigator.push(
              context,
              MaterialPageRoute(
                builder: (context) => ImageViewerScreen(imageUrl: imageUrl),
              ),
            );
          },
          child: Text('View Image'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class ImageViewerScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final String imageUrl;

  ImageViewerScreen({required this.imageUrl});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Image Viewer'),
      ),
      body: ImageViewer(
        image: NetworkImage(imageUrl), // Load image from the network
        // You can also use AssetImage for local images
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the app, initializing the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets ImageViewerExample as the home.
// 3. ImageViewerExample displays a button in the center of the screen.
// 4. When the button is pressed, it navigates to the ImageViewerScreen, passing the image URL.
// 5. ImageViewerScreen displays the image using the ImageViewer widget, allowing users to zoom and pan.
```
