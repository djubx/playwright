// This is the main entry point of the app.
// We create a MaterialApp with a title and a home page.
// The home page is a stateful widget that displays a guidance view.
// The guidance view has a title, description, and a child widget.
// We use a list to store the guidance views and display them one by one.
// We use the onNext and onPrev callbacks to navigate between the guidance views.

// This is the end of the main file example.
