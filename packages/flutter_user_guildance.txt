# Setting Up and Using flutter_user_guidance

## Installation
To add the `flutter_user_guidance` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_user_guidance: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `flutter_user_guidance` package, you need to wrap your main widget with the `UserGuidance` widget and define the steps for the guidance.

### Example Setup
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_user_guidance/flutter_user_guidance.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: UserGuidance(
        steps: [
          Step(
            target: 'targetWidgetKey', // Key of the widget to highlight
            title: 'Welcome!',
            description: 'This is your first step in the app.',
          ),
          // Add more steps as needed
        ],
        child: HomeScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('User Guidance Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          key: Key('targetWidgetKey'), // Key for the tooltip target
          onPressed: () {},
          child: Text('Click Me!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple app with a button that will be highlighted during the onboarding process.

# Complete Example of flutter_user_guidance

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_user_guidance/flutter_user_guidance.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: UserGuidance(
        steps: [
          Step(
            target: 'targetWidgetKey', // Target widget key for the tooltip
            title: 'Welcome!',
            description: 'This is your first step in the app.',
          ),
          Step(
            target: 'secondWidgetKey', // Another target widget key
            title: 'Next Step!',
            description: 'Here is another feature you should know about.',
          ),
        ],
        child: HomeScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('User Guidance Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(
              key: Key('targetWidgetKey'), // Key for the first tooltip target
              onPressed: () {
                // Action for the first button
              },
              child: Text('Click Me!'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              key: Key('secondWidgetKey'), // Key for the second tooltip target
              onPressed: () {
                // Action for the second button
              },
              child: Text('Next Step!'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp class, which initializes the UserGuidance widget.
// 2. The UserGuidance widget takes a list of steps, each defining a target widget and its tooltip content.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget contains two buttons, each with a unique key that matches the target specified in the UserGuidance steps.
// 4. When the app runs, the first tooltip will appear over the first button, guiding the user.
// 5. After the user interacts with the first button, the next tooltip will guide them to the second button.
// 6. This process continues until all steps are completed, providing a seamless onboarding experience.
