# Setting Up flick_video_player

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `flick_video_player` package and explain how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `flick_video_player` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flick_video_player: ^0.3.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

2. Ensure you have the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. Ensure you have the correct deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flick_video_player/flick_video_player.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the `FlickVideoPlayer` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
FlickVideoPlayer(
  flickManager: FlickManager(
    videoPlayerController: VideoPlayerController.network(
      'https://www.example.com/video.mp4',
    ),
  ),
)
```

This code initializes a `FlickVideoPlayer` with a video from a network URL. You can customize the player further by adding controls and handling events.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the `flick_video_player` package in your Flutter application effectively.

# Complete Example of flick_video_player

Below is a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the `flick_video_player` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flick_video_player/flick_video_player.dart';
import 'package:video_player/video_player.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flick Video Player Example',
      home: VideoPlayerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class VideoPlayerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _VideoPlayerScreenState createState() => _VideoPlayerScreenState();
}

class _VideoPlayerScreenState extends State<VideoPlayerScreen> {
  late FlickManager flickManager;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the FlickManager with a VideoPlayerController
    flickManager = FlickManager(
      videoPlayerController: VideoPlayerController.network(
        'https://www.example.com/video.mp4', // Replace with your video URL
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the FlickManager to free up resources
    flickManager.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flick Video Player'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: FlickVideoPlayer(
          flickManager: flickManager,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The VideoPlayerScreen widget is created, which manages the video player state.
// 4. In the initState method, a FlickManager is initialized with a VideoPlayerController that points to a video URL.
// 5. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a FlickVideoPlayer widget.
// 6. When the widget is disposed, the FlickManager is also disposed to free up resources.
