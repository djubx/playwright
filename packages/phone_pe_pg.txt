# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the phone_pe_pg Package

## Installation
To get started with the `phone_pe_pg` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  phone_pe_pg: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

3. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following entries to allow network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Usage
To use the `phone_pe_pg` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:phone_pe_pg/phone_pe_pg.dart';
```

You can then create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class to handle payment processing.

# Complete Example of Using the phone_pe_pg Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:phone_pe_pg/phone_pe_pg.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'PhonePe Payment Example',
      home: PaymentScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PaymentScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PaymentScreenState createState() => _PaymentScreenState();
}

class _PaymentScreenState extends State<PaymentScreen> {
  // Function to initiate payment
  void initiatePayment() async {
    // Create a payment request
    var paymentRequest = {
      'amount': '100', // Amount to be paid
      'currency': 'INR', // Currency type
      'transactionId': 'txn_12345', // Unique transaction ID
      'merchantId': 'merchant_123', // Your merchant ID
    };

    // Call the PhonePe payment method
    var response = await PhonePePayment.startPayment(paymentRequest);

    // Handle the response
    if (response['status'] == 'success') {
      // Payment was successful
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Payment Successful!')),
      );
    } else {
      // Payment failed
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Payment Failed!')),
      );
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('PhonePe Payment'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: initiatePayment, // Trigger payment on button press
          child: Text('Pay with PhonePe'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (PaymentScreen).
// 3. The PaymentScreen widget contains a button that, when pressed, calls the initiatePayment function.
// 4. The initiatePayment function creates a payment request with necessary details and calls the PhonePePayment.startPayment method.
// 5. The response from the payment gateway is checked, and a success or failure message is displayed using a SnackBar.
