# Tutorial: Setting Up Nhost Flutter GraphQL

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `nhost_flutter_graphql` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependencies

First, add the `nhost_flutter_graphql` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  nhost_flutter_graphql: ^0.3.0 # Check for the latest version
```

## Step 2: Configure Nhost

Before using the package, you need to set up an Nhost project:

1. Go to the [Nhost website](https://nhost.io/) and create an account.
2. Create a new project and note down your Nhost backend URL and the GraphQL endpoint.

## Step 3: Initialize Nhost in Your App

In your `main.dart` file, initialize the Nhost client. Here’s how to do it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:nhost_flutter_graphql/nhost_flutter_graphql.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize Nhost client with your backend URL
  Nhost.initialize(
    backendUrl: 'https://your-backend-url.nhost.app',
  );
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 4: Platform-Specific Configurations

### Android

For Android, ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `Info.plist` to allow network requests:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
  <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
  <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 5: Using the Package

You can now use the `nhost_flutter_graphql` package to perform queries and mutations. Here’s a simple example of how to fetch data:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:nhost_flutter_graphql/nhost_flutter_graphql.dart';

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Nhost GraphQL Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: FutureBuilder(
          future: Nhost.graphqlClient.query('''
            query {
              users {
                id
                email
              }
            }
          '''),
          builder: (context, snapshot) {
            if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
              return CircularProgressIndicator();
            }
            if (snapshot.hasError) {
              return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}');
            }
            final users = snapshot.data['data']['users'];
            return ListView.builder(
              itemCount: users.length,
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text(users[index]['email']),
                );
              },
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to set up a simple Flutter application that fetches user data from the Nhost backend using GraphQL.

# Complete Example: Nhost Flutter GraphQL Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:nhost_flutter_graphql/nhost_flutter_graphql.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize Nhost client with your backend URL
  Nhost.initialize(
    backendUrl: 'https://your-backend-url.nhost.app',
  );
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Nhost GraphQL Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: FutureBuilder(
          // Perform a GraphQL query to fetch users
          future: Nhost.graphqlClient.query('''
            query {
              users {
                id
                email
              }
            }
          '''),
          builder: (context, snapshot) {
            // Show loading indicator while waiting for data
            if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
              return CircularProgressIndicator();
            }
            // Handle errors if any occur during the query
            if (snapshot.hasError) {
              return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}');
            }
            // Extract user data from the response
            final users = snapshot.data['data']['users'];
            // Display the list of users
            return ListView.builder(
              itemCount: users.length,
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text(users[index]['email']),
                );
              },
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Nhost client with the backend URL.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is the root widget of the application.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is displayed, which contains a FutureBuilder.
// 4. The FutureBuilder executes a GraphQL query to fetch user data.
// 5. While waiting for the data, a loading indicator is shown.
// 6. If an error occurs, it is displayed on the screen.
// 7. Once the data is fetched, it is displayed in a ListView, showing the email of each user.
