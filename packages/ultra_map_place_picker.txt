# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Ultra Map Place Picker

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `ultra_map_place_picker` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `ultra_map_place_picker` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ultra_map_place_picker: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/ultra_map_place_picker).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request location permissions:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show nearby places.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show nearby places.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `ultra_map_place_picker` in your app.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ultra_map_place_picker/ultra_map_place_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Ultra Map Place Picker Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: PlacePickerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PlacePickerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PlacePickerScreenState createState() => _PlacePickerScreenState();
}

class _PlacePickerScreenState extends State<PlacePickerScreen> {
  // Variable to hold the selected place
  String selectedPlace = "No place selected";

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Place Picker'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the selected place
            Text(selectedPlace),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () async {
                // Open the place picker
                final result = await showPlacePicker(context);
                if (result != null) {
                  // Update the selected place
                  setState(() {
                    selectedPlace = result.name; // Get the name of the selected place
                  });
                }
              },
              child: Text('Pick a Place'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to show the place picker
  Future<PlaceResult?> showPlacePicker(BuildContext context) async {
    return await showDialog<PlaceResult>(
      context: context,
      builder: (context) {
        return PlacePickerDialog(
          // Customize the dialog as needed
          onPlaceSelected: (place) {
            Navigator.of(context).pop(place); // Return the selected place
          },
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home screen is set to PlacePickerScreen, which is a stateful widget.
// 4. In PlacePickerScreen, we have a variable to hold the selected place.
// 5. The UI consists of a Text widget to display the selected place and a button to open the place picker.
// 6. When the button is pressed, the showPlacePicker function is called, which opens a dialog for place selection.
// 7. Once a place is selected, the selected place's name is updated in the state and displayed on the screen.
```
