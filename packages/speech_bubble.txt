# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Speech Bubble Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the **speech_bubble** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  speech_bubble: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:speech_bubble/speech_bubble.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Speech Bubble Widget
You can now use the `SpeechBubble` widget in your Flutter application. Below is an example of how to implement it in a simple chat interface.

### Platform-Specific Details
- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21.
- **iOS**: No additional configuration is required, but ensure you have the latest version of Xcode.

### Example Usage
You can create a speech bubble like this:

```dart
SpeechBubble(
  nip: SpeechBubbleNip.rightBottom, // Position of the bubble
  color: Colors.blue, // Background color
  child: Text('Hello, this is a speech bubble!'), // Content of the bubble
)
```

This will create a speech bubble that points to the right bottom of the text.

# Complete Example of Using the Speech Bubble Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:speech_bubble/speech_bubble.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Speech Bubble Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Speech Bubble Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Creating a speech bubble pointing to the top
              SpeechBubble(
                nip: SpeechBubbleNip.top,
                color: Colors.green,
                child: Text(
                  'This is a speech bubble at the top!',
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
                ),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between bubbles
              // Creating a speech bubble pointing to the bottom
              SpeechBubble(
                nip: SpeechBubbleNip.bottom,
                color: Colors.red,
                child: Text(
                  'This is a speech bubble at the bottom!',
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Speech Bubble Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Column widget.
// 5. Inside the Column, two SpeechBubble widgets are created:
//    - The first bubble is positioned at the top with a green background.
//    - The second bubble is positioned at the bottom with a red background.
// 6. Each SpeechBubble contains a Text widget that displays a message.
// 7. The SizedBox widget is used to add space between the two speech bubbles.
```
