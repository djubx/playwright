Here's a detailed technical blog on the `overlay_loading_progress` Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Overlay Loading Progress Flutter Package

The `overlay_loading_progress` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to enhance user experience by providing visual feedback during long-running operations. This package allows you to display a loading overlay that can be customized to fit the design of your application. 

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `overlay_loading_progress` package in scenarios where:

- **Network Requests**: When fetching data from an API, showing a loading indicator can inform users that the app is processing their request.
- **Heavy Computation**: If your app performs heavy computations or data processing, displaying a loading overlay can prevent users from interacting with the app until the task is complete.
- **File Uploads/Downloads**: During file uploads or downloads, a loading overlay can provide feedback on the progress of the operation.

## Features

- **Customizable Overlay**: You can customize the appearance of the loading overlay, including colors, text, and animations.
- **Easy Integration**: The package is easy to integrate into existing Flutter applications with minimal setup.
- **Platform Support**: It works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

By using this package, you can significantly improve the user experience of your Flutter applications by providing clear feedback during loading states.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Overlay Loading Progress

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `overlay_loading_progress` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  overlay_loading_progress: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:overlay_loading_progress/overlay_loading_progress.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Setup

To use the loading overlay, you need to wrap your main widget with `OverlayLoadingProgress`. Here’s how to do it:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return OverlayLoadingProgress(
      child: MaterialApp(
        home: RealFlutter(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Using the Loading Overlay

You can show the loading overlay by calling the `OverlayLoadingProgress.show()` method. Here’s an example of how to use it in a button's `onPressed` callback:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Overlay Loading Progress Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () async {
            // Show loading overlay
            OverlayLoadingProgress.show(context);
            // Simulate a network request or heavy computation
            await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3));
            // Hide loading overlay
            OverlayLoadingProgress.hide(context);
          },
          child: Text('Start Loading'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your app requires network access.

## Optimizations

- **Performance**: Use lightweight widgets within the overlay to ensure smooth performance.
- **Customization**: Customize the overlay to match your app's theme for a cohesive user experience.

With these steps, you can easily integrate the `overlay_loading_progress` package into your Flutter application and provide users with a better loading experience.

# Complete Example of Overlay Loading Progress

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:overlay_loading_progress/overlay_loading_progress.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Wrapping the MaterialApp with OverlayLoadingProgress
    return OverlayLoadingProgress(
      child: MaterialApp(
        home: RealFlutter(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Overlay Loading Progress Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () async {
            // Show loading overlay when the button is pressed
            OverlayLoadingProgress.show(context);
            // Simulating a network request or heavy computation
            await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3));
            // Hide loading overlay after the operation is complete
            OverlayLoadingProgress.hide(context);
          },
          child: Text('Start Loading'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs MyApp.
// 2. MyApp wraps the MaterialApp with OverlayLoadingProgress, enabling the loading overlay functionality.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget is displayed, containing a button.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the loading overlay is shown using OverlayLoadingProgress.show().
// 5. A simulated delay (representing a network request) occurs for 3 seconds.
// 6. After the delay, the loading overlay is hidden using OverlayLoadingProgress.hide().
// 7. The user can see the loading overlay during the delay, providing feedback that the app is processing their request.
