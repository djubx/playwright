# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using ml_linalg

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `ml_linalg` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ml_linalg: ^0.2.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the package as follows:

```dart
import 'package:ml_linalg/ml_linalg.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package

You can now use the `ml_linalg` package to perform various linear algebra operations. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create matrices and perform operations:

```dart
void main() {
  // Create a 2x2 matrix
  final matrixA = Matrix.fromList([
    [1, 2],
    [3, 4],
  ]);

  // Create another 2x2 matrix
  final matrixB = Matrix.fromList([
    [5, 6],
    [7, 8],
  ]);

  // Perform matrix addition
  final result = matrixA + matrixB;

  // Print the result
  print(result);
}
```

This example demonstrates how to create matrices and perform addition using the `ml_linalg` package.

# Complete Example of ml_linalg in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ml_linalg/ml_linalg.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'ml_linalg Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('ml_linalg Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: MatrixOperations(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MatrixOperations extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create two matrices
    final matrixA = Matrix.fromList([
      [1, 2],
      [3, 4],
    ]);

    final matrixB = Matrix.fromList([
      [5, 6],
      [7, 8],
    ]);

    // Perform matrix addition
    final additionResult = matrixA + matrixB;

    // Perform matrix multiplication
    final multiplicationResult = matrixA * matrixB;

    // Display results
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Text('Matrix A: $matrixA'),
        Text('Matrix B: $matrixB'),
        Text('Addition Result: $additionResult'),
        Text('Multiplication Result: $multiplicationResult'),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds the MatrixOperations widget.
// 4. The MatrixOperations widget creates two matrices (matrixA and matrixB) using the ml_linalg package.
// 5. It performs addition and multiplication on these matrices.
// 6. Finally, it displays the original matrices and the results of the operations in a column layout.
```
