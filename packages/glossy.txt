### Tutorial
To get started with the "glossy" package, follow these steps:

1. Add the package to your Flutter project by adding the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  glossy: ^1.0.0
```
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.
3. Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:glossy/glossy.dart';
```
4. Use the `Glossy` widget to add a glossy effect to your widget:
```dart
Glossy(
  child: YourWidget(),
  glossiness: 0.5, // adjust the glossiness level
  color: Colors.white, // customize the color
  shape: GlossyShape.circle, // customize the shape
)
```
For platform-specific details, note that the "glossy" package uses the `ClipPath` widget to create the glossy effect, which may not work as expected on some older Android devices. To optimize performance on these devices, you can use the `Glossy.android` constructor, which uses a different approach to create the glossy effect:
```dart
Glossy.android(
  child: YourWidget(),
  glossiness: 0.5,
  color: Colors.white,
  shape: GlossyShape.circle,
)
```
On iOS, the "glossy" package uses the `UIBezierPath` class to create the glossy effect, which provides a smooth and high-quality result.

              Glossy(
                child: Icon(Icons.star, size: 50),
                glossiness: 0.8,
                color: Colors.yellow,
                shape: GlossyShape.circle,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Create a glossy image
              Glossy(
                child: Image.asset('assets/image.jpg', width: 100, height: 100),
                glossiness: 0.2,
                color: Colors.white,
                shape: GlossyShape.rectangle,
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a scaffold containing an app bar and a body.
// 2. The body contains a column of widgets, each with a glossy effect applied using the Glossy widget.
// 3. The first widget is a button with a glossy effect, which is created using the Glossy widget with a glossiness level of 0.5 and a circular shape.
// 4. The second widget is an icon with a glossy effect, which is created using the Glossy widget with a glossiness level of 0.8 and a circular shape.
// 5. The third widget is an image with a glossy effect, which is created using the Glossy widget with a glossiness level of 0.2 and a rectangular shape.
// 6. The user can interact with each widget as they would normally, but with the added visual appeal of the glossy effect.
