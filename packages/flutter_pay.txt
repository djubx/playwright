# Setting Up and Using the Flutter Pay Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_pay` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_pay` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_pay: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Add the necessary permissions and metadata in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   <application>
       <meta-data
           android:name="flutter_pay.api_key"
           android:value="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"/>
   </application>
   ```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure your `build.gradle` file is set up correctly to include the necessary dependencies.

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Add the required permissions in your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. **CocoaPods**: Make sure to run `pod install` in the `ios` directory to install the necessary dependencies.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in our application.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_pay/flutter_pay.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Pay Example',
      home: PaymentScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PaymentScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PaymentScreenState createState() => _PaymentScreenState();
}

class _PaymentScreenState extends State<PaymentScreen> {
  // Method to initiate payment
  void _initiatePayment() async {
    try {
      // Create a payment request
      final paymentResult = await FlutterPay.initiatePayment(
        amount: '10.00',
        currency: 'USD',
        description: 'Payment for Order #1234',
      );

      // Handle payment result
      if (paymentResult.success) {
        // Payment was successful
        ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
          SnackBar(content: Text('Payment Successful!')),
        );
      } else {
        // Payment failed
        ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
          SnackBar(content: Text('Payment Failed: ${paymentResult.error}')),
        );
      }
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Error: $e')),
      );
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Pay')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _initiatePayment,
          child: Text('Pay Now'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Flutter Pay

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_pay/flutter_pay.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Pay Example',
      home: PaymentScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PaymentScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PaymentScreenState createState() => _PaymentScreenState();
}

class _PaymentScreenState extends State<PaymentScreen> {
  // Method to initiate payment
  void _initiatePayment() async {
    try {
      // Create a payment request
      final paymentResult = await FlutterPay.initiatePayment(
        amount: '10.00', // Amount to be charged
        currency: 'USD', // Currency type
        description: 'Payment for Order #1234', // Description of the payment
      );

      // Handle payment result
      if (paymentResult.success) {
        // Payment was successful
        ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
          SnackBar(content: Text('Payment Successful!')),
        );
      } else {
        // Payment failed
        ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
          SnackBar(content: Text('Payment Failed: ${paymentResult.error}')),
        );
      }
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Error: $e')),
      );
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Pay')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _initiatePayment, // Trigger payment on button press
          child: Text('Pay Now'), // Button label
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The PaymentScreen widget is displayed as the home screen.
// 3. When the user taps the "Pay Now" button, the _initiatePayment method is called.
// 4. This method creates a payment request with the specified amount, currency, and description.
// 5. The payment result is awaited, and based on the success or failure, a SnackBar is shown to the user.
// 6. If an error occurs during the payment process, it is caught and displayed in a SnackBar.
```
