The final summary of the code flow is that the RealFlutter app is run, which creates a new Atlas instance. The Atlas instance sets the title and home properties, which are used to display the app's title and content. The content is a Scaffold widget that contains an AppBar and a Center widget. The AppBar displays the title, and the Center widget displays the text 'Hello, World!'.
