# Complete Example of Floating Pull-Up Card

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:floating_pullup_card/floating_pullup_card.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Floating Pull-Up Card Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Floating Pull-Up Card Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: FloatingPullUpCard(
            // The main content of the card
            child: Column(
              mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,
              children: [
                ListTile(
                  title: Text('Item 1'),
                  subtitle: Text('Details about Item 1'),
                ),
                ListTile(
                  title: Text('Item 2'),
                  subtitle: Text('Details about Item 2'),
                ),
                ListTile(
                  title: Text('Item 3'),
                  subtitle: Text('Details about Item 3'),
                ),
              ],
            ),
            // The height of the card when expanded
            expandedHeight: 300,
            // The height of the card when collapsed
            collapsedHeight: 100,
            // Optional: Customize the background color
            backgroundColor: Colors.blueAccent,
            // Optional: Add a title to the card
            title: Text(
              'Pull-Up Card',
              style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Floating Pull-Up Card Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers the FloatingPullUpCard widget.
// 5. The FloatingPullUpCard widget contains a Column with ListTile widgets representing items.
// 6. The card can be pulled up to reveal more content, with customizable heights for both states.
// 7. The card's background color and title can also be customized for better aesthetics.
