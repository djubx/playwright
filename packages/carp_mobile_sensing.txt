# Overview of the carp_mobile_sensing Flutter Package

The `carp_mobile_sensing` package is a powerful tool designed for mobile sensing applications, particularly in the context of research and data collection. It provides a framework for building applications that can collect various types of data from mobile devices, such as location, accelerometer data, and user interactions. This package is particularly useful for researchers and developers who need to gather real-time data for studies in fields like health, psychology, and social sciences.

## When to Use This Package
- **Research Studies**: Ideal for applications that require data collection from participants in real-time.
- **Health Monitoring**: Useful for apps that track physical activity, location, and other health-related metrics.
- **User Behavior Analysis**: Helps in understanding user interactions and behaviors through sensor data.

## Key Features
- **Data Collection**: Collects data from various sensors available on mobile devices.
- **Customizable Surveys**: Allows the creation of customizable surveys to gather user input.
- **Real-time Data Processing**: Processes data in real-time, enabling immediate feedback and analysis.
- **Integration with Backend Services**: Easily integrates with backend services for data storage and analysis.

The `carp_mobile_sensing` package is a comprehensive solution for developers looking to implement mobile sensing capabilities in their applications.

# Setting Up and Using the carp_mobile_sensing Package

## Installation
To get started with the `carp_mobile_sensing` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  carp_mobile_sensing: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/carp_mobile_sensing).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. **Permissions**: Update your `AndroidManifest.xml` to include necessary permissions for accessing sensors and location data:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION"/>
```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `build.gradle` file.

### iOS
1. **Permissions**: Update your `Info.plist` to request permissions for location and motion data:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to provide better services.</string>
<key>NSMotionUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to motion data for health tracking.</string>
```

2. **Capabilities**: Enable background modes if you want to collect data while the app is in the background.

## Basic Usage
Once the package is installed and configured, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initialize the sensing framework and start collecting data.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:carp_mobile_sensing/carp_mobile_sensing.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Mobile Sensing App',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Mobile Sensing Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Start the sensing process
              SensingService.startSensing();
            },
            child: Text('Start Sensing'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app with a button that starts the sensing process when pressed. The `SensingService.startSensing()` method initializes the data collection.

# Complete Example of Using carp_mobile_sensing

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:carp_mobile_sensing/carp_mobile_sensing.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to hold the sensing status
  bool isSensing = false;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the sensing service
    SensingService.initialize();
  }

  // Function to start sensing
  void startSensing() {
    setState(() {
      isSensing = true; // Update the sensing status
    });
    SensingService.startSensing(); // Start data collection
  }

  // Function to stop sensing
  void stopSensing() {
    setState(() {
      isSensing = false; // Update the sensing status
    });
    SensingService.stopSensing(); // Stop data collection
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Mobile Sensing App',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Mobile Sensing Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              Text(isSensing ? 'Sensing is ON' : 'Sensing is OFF'),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: isSensing ? stopSensing : startSensing,
                child: Text(isSensing ? 'Stop Sensing' : 'Start Sensing'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

```dart
// This Flutter application demonstrates the use of the carp_mobile_sensing package.
// The app initializes the sensing service and provides a button to start and stop data collection.

// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 2. In the initState method, we initialize the SensingService to prepare for data collection.
// 3. The startSensing method updates the state to indicate that sensing is active and calls the startSensing method from the SensingService.
// 4. The stopSensing method updates the state to indicate that sensing is inactive and calls the stopSensing method from the SensingService.
// 5. The build method creates a simple UI with a text display showing the current sensing status and a button to toggle sensing on and off.
// 6. When the button is pressed, it either starts or stops the sensing process based on the current state.

```
