# Tutorial: Setting Up the PayPal SDK in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `paypal_sdk` package and explain how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `paypal_sdk` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  paypal_sdk: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Configure for Android

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.yourapp">

    <application
        ...
        android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"> <!-- Allow cleartext traffic for testing -->
        ...
    </application>

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
</manifest>
```

## Step 3: Configure for iOS

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. Ensure you have the necessary permissions for network access.

## Step 4: Initialize the SDK

In your main Dart file, initialize the PayPal SDK. You can do this in the `main()` function:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:paypal_sdk/paypal_sdk.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'PayPal SDK Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Implement Payment Logic

Now, let's implement the payment logic in the `RealFlutter` class. This will include creating a payment and handling the response.

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Initialize PayPal SDK
  final PayPalSdk _paypalSdk = PayPalSdk(clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID', secret: 'YOUR_SECRET');

  void _makePayment() async {
    // Create a payment request
    final payment = Payment(
      amount: '10.00',
      currency: 'USD',
      description: 'Payment for services',
    );

    // Execute the payment
    final response = await _paypalSdk.createPayment(payment);

    // Handle the response
    if (response.success) {
      // Payment was successful
      print('Payment successful: ${response.paymentId}');
    } else {
      // Payment failed
      print('Payment failed: ${response.error}');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('PayPal Payment Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _makePayment,
          child: Text('Pay with PayPal'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of PayPal SDK in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:paypal_sdk/paypal_sdk.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'PayPal SDK Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Initialize PayPal SDK with your client ID and secret
  final PayPalSdk _paypalSdk = PayPalSdk(clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID', secret: 'YOUR_SECRET');

  // Function to handle payment
  void _makePayment() async {
    // Create a payment request with amount, currency, and description
    final payment = Payment(
      amount: '10.00', // Amount to be charged
      currency: 'USD', // Currency type
      description: 'Payment for services', // Description of the payment
    );

    // Execute the payment and await the response
    final response = await _paypalSdk.createPayment(payment);

    // Check if the payment was successful
    if (response.success) {
      // If successful, print the payment ID
      print('Payment successful: ${response.paymentId}');
    } else {
      // If failed, print the error message
      print('Payment failed: ${response.error}');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('PayPal Payment Example'), // Title of the app
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _makePayment, // Call the payment function on button press
          child: Text('Pay with PayPal'), // Button text
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. In RealFlutter, the PayPal SDK is initialized with the client ID and secret.
// 4. When the user presses the "Pay with PayPal" button, the _makePayment function is called.
// 5. A payment request is created with the specified amount, currency, and description.
// 6. The payment is executed, and the response is awaited.
// 7. If the payment is successful, the payment ID is printed; otherwise, the error message is printed.
```
