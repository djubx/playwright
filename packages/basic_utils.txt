<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Basic Utils Flutter Package

The **basic_utils** package is a versatile utility library designed to simplify common tasks in Flutter applications. It provides a collection of functions and classes that can help developers streamline their code, enhance readability, and reduce boilerplate. This package is particularly useful for tasks such as string manipulation, data validation, and formatting.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the **basic_utils** package in scenarios such as:
- When you need to perform frequent string manipulations (e.g., formatting, parsing).
- When you require utility functions for data validation (e.g., checking email formats, phone numbers).
- When you want to enhance the readability of your code by using well-defined utility functions instead of writing repetitive code.

## Key Features
- **String Utilities**: Functions for string manipulation, including formatting and parsing.
- **Data Validation**: Easy-to-use validators for common data types.
- **Collection Utilities**: Functions to work with lists and maps efficiently.
- **Date and Time Utilities**: Simplified handling of date and time formats.

By leveraging the **basic_utils** package, developers can focus more on building features rather than dealing with repetitive utility code.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Basic Utils

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **basic_utils** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  basic_utils: ^3.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to set the platform version in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the package as follows:

```dart
import 'package:basic_utils/basic_utils.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using Basic Utils

You can now use the various utilities provided by the package. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use string utilities and data validation:

```dart
String formattedString = StringUtils.capitalize("hello world"); // Capitalizes the first letter
bool isValidEmail = ValidatorUtils.isEmail("example@example.com"); // Validates email format
```

With these steps, you are now ready to utilize the **basic_utils** package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Basic Utils in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:basic_utils/basic_utils.dart'; // Importing the basic_utils package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the RealFlutter application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Basic Utils Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Basic Utils Demo'), // App bar title
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying a formatted string
              Text(
                StringUtils.capitalize("hello world!"), // Capitalizes the string
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between widgets
              // Validating and displaying email status
              Text(
                ValidatorUtils.isEmail("example@example.com") 
                    ? "Valid Email" 
                    : "Invalid Email", // Validates email format
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.green),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that centers its children.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange two Text widgets vertically.
// 5. The first Text widget displays a capitalized version of "hello world!" using StringUtils.
// 6. The second Text widget checks if the provided email is valid using ValidatorUtils and displays the result.
// 7. The app demonstrates the basic functionalities of the basic_utils package effectively.
