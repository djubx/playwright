// The app starts by running the `main` function, which creates an instance of the `RealFlutter` widget.
// The `RealFlutter` widget is a stateful widget that calculates the prayer times when it is initialized.
// The prayer times are calculated using the `PrayTimes` class, which takes in the user's location and the current date.
// The calculated prayer times are then stored in the `_prayerTimes` list.
// The app then builds a `MaterialApp` widget with a `Scaffold` widget as its home.
// The `Scaffold` widget has an `AppBar` widget with a title, and a `ListView` widget that displays the prayer times.
// Each prayer time is displayed as a `ListTile` widget with the prayer name and time.

// When the app is run, it will display a list of prayer times for the current date and location.
