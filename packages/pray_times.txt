# Overview of the pray_times Flutter Package

The `pray_times` Flutter package is designed to help developers calculate Islamic prayer times based on geographical location and date. This package is particularly useful for applications aimed at Muslim users who need to know the precise times for daily prayers. 

## When to Use This Package
- **Islamic Applications**: If you are developing an app that serves the Muslim community, such as a Quran reader, Islamic calendar, or a community app, this package can be a valuable addition.
- **Location-Based Services**: Apps that provide services based on the user's location can integrate prayer time features to enhance user experience.

## Key Features
- **Accurate Prayer Time Calculation**: The package uses various calculation methods to provide accurate prayer times.
- **Location Support**: Users can input their geographical coordinates to get prayer times specific to their location.
- **Multiple Calculation Methods**: Supports different methods for calculating prayer times, accommodating various Islamic schools of thought.
- **Customizable**: Allows customization of prayer time calculation parameters.

# Setting Up the pray_times Package

## Installation
To use the `pray_times` package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  pray_times: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` to allow location services if you plan to use the user's location for prayer time calculations. Add the following keys:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to provide accurate prayer times.</string>
```

## Using the Package
Once the package is installed and configured, you can start using it in your Flutter application. 

1. Import the package in your Dart file:
   ```dart
   import 'package:pray_times/pray_times.dart';
   ```

2. Create an instance of the `PrayTimes` class and use it to calculate prayer times based on the user's location and date.

# Complete Example of Using pray_times

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pray_times/pray_times.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Prayer Times App',
      home: PrayerTimesScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PrayerTimesScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PrayerTimesScreenState createState() => _PrayerTimesScreenState();
}

class _PrayerTimesScreenState extends State<PrayerTimesScreen> {
  // Declare variables to hold prayer times
  List<String> prayerTimes = [];
  
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Calculate prayer times when the widget is initialized
    _calculatePrayerTimes();
  }

  void _calculatePrayerTimes() {
    // Create an instance of PrayTimes
    PrayTimes prayTimes = PrayTimes();
    
    // Set the calculation method (e.g., ISNA)
    prayTimes.setMethod(Method.ISNA);
    
    // Get today's date
    DateTime now = DateTime.now();
    
    // Define the location (latitude and longitude)
    double latitude = 40.7128; // Example: New York City
    double longitude = -74.0060;
    
    // Calculate prayer times
    prayerTimes = prayTimes.getPrayerTimes(now, latitude, longitude);
    
    // Update the state to reflect the new prayer times
    setState(() {});
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Prayer Times'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: prayerTimes.isEmpty
            ? CircularProgressIndicator() // Show loading indicator while calculating
            : ListView.builder(
                itemCount: prayerTimes.length,
                itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                  return ListTile(
                    title: Text(prayerTimes[index]), // Display each prayer time
                  );
                },
              ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```
// The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home screen.
// The PrayerTimesScreen is a StatefulWidget that manages the state of prayer times.
// In the initState method, we call _calculatePrayerTimes to fetch the prayer times when the widget is initialized.
// The _calculatePrayerTimes method creates an instance of PrayTimes, sets the calculation method, and defines the location.
// It then retrieves today's date and calculates the prayer times based on the specified latitude and longitude.
// The calculated prayer times are stored in the prayerTimes list, and setState is called to update the UI.
// In the build method, we check if prayerTimes is empty; if so, we show a loading indicator.
// Once the prayer times are calculated, we display them in a ListView, with each time shown in a ListTile.
