# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `image_picker_plus`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `image_picker_plus` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  image_picker_plus: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker_plus).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the required permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request permissions:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to take photos.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to select images.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to implement the image picker functionality.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:image_picker_plus/image_picker_plus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Image Picker Plus Demo',
      home: ImagePickerDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class ImagePickerDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ImagePickerDemoState createState() => _ImagePickerDemoState();
}

class _ImagePickerDemoState extends State<ImagePickerDemo> {
  List<PickedFile>? _imageFiles; // Variable to hold selected images

  // Function to pick images from the gallery
  Future<void> _pickImages() async {
    try {
      // Use the image picker to select multiple images
      final List<PickedFile>? pickedFiles = await ImagePickerPlus().pickMultiImage(
        maxImages: 5, // Limit to 5 images
        imageQuality: 80, // Set image quality to 80%
      );

      // Update the state with the selected images
      setState(() {
        _imageFiles = pickedFiles;
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during image picking
      print('Error picking images: $e');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Image Picker Plus Demo'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: _pickImages, // Call the image picking function
            child: Text('Pick Images'),
          ),
          Expanded(
            child: _imageFiles == null
                ? Center(child: Text('No images selected.'))
                : GridView.builder(
                    gridDelegate: SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount(
                      crossAxisCount: 3, // Display 3 images per row
                    ),
                    itemCount: _imageFiles!.length,
                    itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                      return Image.file(
                        File(_imageFiles![index].path), // Display the selected image
                        fit: BoxFit.cover,
                      );
                    },
                  ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and home set to ImagePickerDemo.
// 3. ImagePickerDemo is a stateful widget that manages the state of selected images.
// 4. The _pickImages function is called when the user presses the "Pick Images" button.
// 5. This function uses the ImagePickerPlus to allow the user to select multiple images.
// 6. The selected images are stored in the _imageFiles variable and displayed in a GridView.
// 7. If no images are selected, a message is shown in the center of the screen.
```
