# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Stacked List Carousel

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **stacked_list_carousel** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **stacked_list_carousel** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  stacked_list_carousel: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the platform version in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the **stacked_list_carousel** in your app.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:stacked_list_carousel/stacked_list_carousel.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Stacked List Carousel Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Stacked List Carousel'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: StackedListCarousel(
            items: [
              // Adding items to the carousel
              CarouselItem(color: Colors.red, text: 'Item 1'),
              CarouselItem(color: Colors.green, text: 'Item 2'),
              CarouselItem(color: Colors.blue, text: 'Item 3'),
              CarouselItem(color: Colors.orange, text: 'Item 4'),
            ],
            // Setting the height of the carousel
            height: 200,
            // Setting the width of the carousel
            width: double.infinity,
            // Setting the spacing between items
            itemSpacing: 10,
            // Setting the animation duration
            animationDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 300),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The CarouselItem widget represents each item in the carousel
class CarouselItem extends StatelessWidget {
  final Color color;
  final String text;

  CarouselItem({required this.color, required this.text});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      // Setting the background color of the item
      color: color,
      // Adding padding to the item
      padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
      // Centering the text within the item
      child: Center(
        child: Text(
          text,
          style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

/*
  Application Flow Explanation:
  1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
  2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
  3. Inside the Center widget, we create a StackedListCarousel and provide it with a list of CarouselItem widgets.
  4. Each CarouselItem is a colored container with centered text, representing an item in the carousel.
  5. The carousel is configured with specific height, width, item spacing, and animation duration.
  6. When the app runs, users can swipe through the carousel items, experiencing smooth transitions and a visually appealing layout.
