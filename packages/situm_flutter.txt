# Situm Flutter Package: A Comprehensive Overview

The **situm_flutter** package is a powerful tool designed for integrating indoor positioning and navigation capabilities into Flutter applications. This package leverages Situm's advanced location services to provide accurate indoor positioning, making it ideal for applications in environments such as shopping malls, airports, and large buildings where GPS signals may be weak or unavailable.

## When to Use Situm Flutter
- **Indoor Navigation**: When you need to guide users through complex indoor environments.
- **Location-Based Services**: For applications that require precise location tracking within buildings.
- **Real-Time Positioning**: When your app needs to provide real-time updates on user location.

## Key Features
- **Indoor Positioning**: Accurate positioning within buildings using Wi-Fi and Bluetooth signals.
- **Map Integration**: Ability to integrate custom indoor maps for navigation.
- **User Tracking**: Real-time tracking of user movements within the indoor space.
- **Event Handling**: Support for various events such as entering or exiting specific zones.

The **situm_flutter** package is an excellent choice for developers looking to enhance their applications with indoor navigation capabilities, providing a seamless user experience in complex environments.

# Situm Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the **situm_flutter** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  situm_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/situm_flutter).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. **Permissions**: Add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/>
```

2. **Google Services**: Ensure you have the Google Play services set up in your project.

### iOS
1. **Permissions**: Add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to provide indoor navigation.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to provide indoor navigation.</string>
```

2. **Capabilities**: Enable location services in your Xcode project settings.

## Basic Usage
To use the **situm_flutter** package, you will typically follow these steps:

1. **Initialize the Situm SDK**.
2. **Load the indoor map**.
3. **Start tracking the user's location**.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set this up in your Flutter application:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:situm_flutter/situm_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Situm Flutter Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Initialize Situm SDK
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    SitumFlutter.initialize();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Situm Indoor Navigation'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Situm Flutter is ready!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code initializes the Situm SDK and sets up a basic Flutter application. You can expand upon this by adding more features such as map loading and user tracking.

# Complete Example of Situm Flutter Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:situm_flutter/situm_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Situm Flutter Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to hold the user's current position
  Position? _currentPosition;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the Situm SDK
    SitumFlutter.initialize();
    // Start tracking the user's location
    _startTracking();
  }

  void _startTracking() {
    // Start listening to location updates
    SitumFlutter.onPositionChanged.listen((Position position) {
      setState(() {
        _currentPosition = position; // Update the current position
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Situm Indoor Navigation'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: _currentPosition != null
            ? Text('Current Position: ${_currentPosition!.latitude}, ${_currentPosition!.longitude}')
            : Text('Tracking position...'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application using the Situm Flutter package.
// 1. The `main` function initializes the app and sets `RealFlutter` as the home widget.
// 2. In `RealFlutter`, we define a stateful widget to manage the user's position.
// 3. The `initState` method initializes the Situm SDK and starts tracking the user's location.
// 4. The `_startTracking` method listens for position updates and updates the state accordingly.
// 5. The UI displays the current position or a loading message while tracking.
// 6. The `Position` object contains latitude and longitude, which are displayed in the center of the screen.
