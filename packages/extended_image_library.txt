Here's a detailed technical blog on the "extended_image_library" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Extended Image Library Flutter Package

The **extended_image_library** package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to enhance their image handling capabilities. This package extends the functionality of the standard Flutter image widget, providing additional features such as image caching, zooming, panning, and more. It is particularly useful in applications that require advanced image manipulation or display, such as photo galleries, image editors, or any app that deals with high-resolution images.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the **extended_image_library** package in scenarios such as:
- **Photo Galleries**: When displaying a collection of images that users can zoom in and out of.
- **Image Editors**: If your application allows users to edit images, this package provides the necessary tools for image manipulation.
- **High-Resolution Images**: For apps that need to display high-resolution images efficiently, leveraging caching and optimized loading.

## Key Features
- **Zoomable Images**: Users can pinch to zoom in and out of images.
- **Panning**: Users can drag images around to view different parts.
- **Image Caching**: Efficiently caches images to improve performance and reduce loading times.
- **Customizable**: Offers various customization options for image display and behavior.

With these features, the **extended_image_library** package is an excellent choice for any Flutter application that requires advanced image handling capabilities.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Extended Image Library

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **extended_image_library** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  extended_image: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/extended_image).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add permissions for accessing the photo library if your app requires it. Open your `Info.plist` file and add:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your photo library.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the **extended_image_library** package in your app.

<!-- END_TUTORIAL -->

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:extended_image/extended_image.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Extended Image Library Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Extended Image Library Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ExtendedImage.network(
            'https://example.com/image.jpg', // URL of the image
            fit: BoxFit.cover, // How the image should be inscribed into the box
            mode: ExtendedImageMode.gesture, // Enables gesture controls
            initGestureConfigHandler: (ExtendedImageState state) {
              return GestureConfig(
                minScale: 0.8, // Minimum zoom level
                maxScale: 3.0, // Maximum zoom level
                animationDuration: const Duration(milliseconds: 100), // Animation duration for zooming
                animationCurve: Curves.easeInOut, // Animation curve for zooming
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The above code sets up a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the extended_image_library package.
// 1. The main function runs the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Extended Image Library Demo".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers an ExtendedImage widget that loads an image from a network URL.
// 5. The ExtendedImage widget is configured to allow gestures, enabling users to zoom in and out of the image.
// 6. The initGestureConfigHandler sets the minimum and maximum zoom levels, along with animation settings for a smooth user experience.
```
