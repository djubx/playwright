# Setting Up the Tencent Bugly Plugin

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `tencent_bugly_plugin` in a Flutter project, including platform-specific configurations for both Android and iOS.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `tencent_bugly_plugin` to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  tencent_bugly_plugin: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/tencent_bugly_plugin).

## Step 2: Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions and metadata:

```xml
<manifest>
    <application>
        ...
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.tencent.bugly.APPID"
            android:value="YOUR_BUGLY_APP_ID" />
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.tencent.bugly.APPKEY"
            android:value="YOUR_BUGLY_APP_KEY" />
    </application>
</manifest>
```

Replace `YOUR_BUGLY_APP_ID` and `YOUR_BUGLY_APP_KEY` with your actual Bugly credentials.

2. **Enable ProGuard** (optional): If you are using ProGuard, ensure that you add the necessary rules to keep Bugly classes.

## Step 3: iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following entries:

```xml
<key>BuglyAppId</key>
<string>YOUR_BUGLY_APP_ID</string>
<key>BuglyAppKey</key>
<string>YOUR_BUGLY_APP_KEY</string>
```

Replace `YOUR_BUGLY_APP_ID` and `YOUR_BUGLY_APP_KEY` with your actual Bugly credentials.

2. **CocoaPods**: Ensure that your `Podfile` is set up to use frameworks:

```ruby
use_frameworks!
```

## Step 4: Initialize Bugly

In your main Dart file, initialize Bugly in the `main()` function:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tencent_bugly_plugin/tencent_bugly_plugin.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize Bugly with your App ID
  TencentBuglyPlugin.init('YOUR_BUGLY_APP_ID');
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

Now you are ready to use the `tencent_bugly_plugin` in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Using Tencent Bugly Plugin

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tencent_bugly_plugin/tencent_bugly_plugin.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize Bugly with your App ID
  TencentBuglyPlugin.init('YOUR_BUGLY_APP_ID');
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Bugly Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Bugly Example Home'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Press the button to simulate a crash.'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Simulate a crash
                throw Exception('This is a simulated crash for Bugly!');
              },
              child: Text('Simulate Crash'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts by initializing Bugly with the provided App ID.
// 2. The main widget, RealFlutter, is created, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is displayed, containing a button to simulate a crash.
// 4. When the button is pressed, an exception is thrown, which Bugly captures and reports.
// 5. This allows developers to see the crash report in the Bugly dashboard for further analysis.
