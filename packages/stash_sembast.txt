# Stash Sembast: A Flutter Package for Local Storage

The `stash_sembast` package is a powerful solution for Flutter developers looking to implement local storage in their applications. Built on top of the Sembast database, it provides a simple and efficient way to store key-value pairs and complex data structures. This package is particularly useful for applications that require persistent data storage without the overhead of a full-fledged database system.

## When to Use `stash_sembast`
- **Offline Data Storage**: Ideal for applications that need to function without an internet connection.
- **Caching**: Useful for caching data fetched from APIs to improve performance and reduce network calls.
- **User Preferences**: Great for storing user settings and preferences locally.

## Key Features
- **Simple API**: Easy to use with a straightforward API for storing and retrieving data.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Supports asynchronous operations, making it suitable for Flutter's reactive programming model.
- **Data Persistence**: Ensures data is persisted across app restarts.
- **Flexible Data Types**: Supports various data types, including lists and maps.

Overall, `stash_sembast` is an excellent choice for Flutter developers looking for a lightweight and efficient local storage solution.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `stash_sembast`

## Installation
To get started with `stash_sembast`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  stash_sembast: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/stash_sembast).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` if you are accessing any sensitive data. However, for basic local storage, no additional configuration is required.

## Basic Usage
Hereâ€™s how to set up and use `stash_sembast` in your Flutter application:

1. **Import the Package**:
   ```dart
   import 'package:stash/stash.dart';
   import 'package:stash_sembast/stash_sembast.dart';
   ```

2. **Create a Store**:
   ```dart
   final store = SembastStore('my_store');
   ```

3. **Open the Store**:
   ```dart
   final database = await store.open();
   ```

4. **Storing Data**:
   ```dart
   await database['key'] = 'value';
   ```

5. **Retrieving Data**:
   ```dart
   final value = await database['key'];
   ```

6. **Deleting Data**:
   ```dart
   await database.remove('key');
   ```

With these steps, you can easily implement local storage in your Flutter application using `stash_sembast`.

# Complete Example of Using `stash_sembast`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:stash/stash.dart';
import 'package:stash_sembast/stash_sembast.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Stash Sembast Example',
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomePageState createState() => _HomePageState();
}

class _HomePageState extends State<HomePage> {
  late SembastStore store; // Declare the store
  String storedValue = ''; // Variable to hold the retrieved value

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _initializeStore(); // Initialize the store when the widget is created
  }

  // Function to initialize the store
  Future<void> _initializeStore() async {
    store = SembastStore('my_store'); // Create a new store
    final database = await store.open(); // Open the store
    await database['key'] = 'Hello, Stash Sembast!'; // Store a value
    _retrieveValue(database); // Retrieve the value after storing
  }

  // Function to retrieve the stored value
  Future<void> _retrieveValue(SembastStore database) async {
    final value = await database['key']; // Get the value from the store
    setState(() {
      storedValue = value; // Update the state with the retrieved value
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Stash Sembast Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(storedValue), // Display the retrieved value
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a HomePage as its home.
// 3. HomePage initializes the Sembast store in its initState method.
// 4. The store is opened, and a value is stored with the key 'key'.
// 5. After storing, the app retrieves the value associated with 'key'.
// 6. The retrieved value is displayed in the center of the screen.
