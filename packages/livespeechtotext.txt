# Tutorial: Setting Up the Livespeechtotext Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `livespeechtotext` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the `livespeechtotext` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  livespeechtotext: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/livespeechtotext).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request microphone access:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to the microphone for speech recognition.</string>
<key>NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to speech recognition services.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement speech-to-text functionality.

# Complete Example: RealFlutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:livespeechtotext/livespeechtotext.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _transcription = ""; // Variable to hold the transcribed text
  LivespeechToText _speechToText; // Instance of the LivespeechToText class

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _speechToText = LivespeechToText(); // Initialize the speech-to-text instance
  }

  // Function to start listening for speech
  void _startListening() async {
    await _speechToText.startListening((text) {
      setState(() {
        _transcription = text; // Update the transcription variable with the recognized text
      });
    });
  }

  // Function to stop listening for speech
  void _stopListening() async {
    await _speechToText.stopListening(); // Stop the speech recognition
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Live Speech to Text Example'), // App title
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text(
                'Transcription:', // Label for the transcription
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              Text(
                _transcription, // Display the transcribed text
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _startListening, // Start listening button
                child: Text('Start Listening'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _stopListening, // Stop listening button
                child: Text('Stop Listening'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation
// The application starts by initializing the `RealFlutter` widget.
// In the `initState` method, we create an instance of `LivespeechToText`.
// The `_startListening` method is called when the user presses the "Start Listening" button.
// This method starts the speech recognition and updates the `_transcription` variable with the recognized text.
// The `_stopListening` method stops the speech recognition when the user presses the "Stop Listening" button.
// The transcribed text is displayed in the center of the screen, updating in real-time as the user speaks.
// The app provides a simple interface with buttons to control the speech recognition process.

In summary, the `livespeechtotext` Flutter package provides a straightforward way to implement real-time speech recognition in your applications. By following the setup and usage instructions outlined in this blog, you can easily integrate voice input capabilities into your Flutter projects, enhancing user interaction and accessibility.
