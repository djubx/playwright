# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the QRScan Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `qrscan` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  qrscan: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/qrscan).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add camera permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request camera access:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the camera to scan QR codes.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the QRScan Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to implement QR code scanning.

# Complete Example: QR Code Scanning Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:qrscan/qrscan.dart' as qrscan;

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'QR Scan Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: QRScanHome(),
    );
  }
}

class QRScanHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _QRScanHomeState createState() => _QRScanHomeState();
}

class _QRScanHomeState extends State<QRScanHome> {
  String result = "Scan a QR code";

  // Function to initiate the QR code scanning
  Future<void> scanQRCode() async {
    String scannedData = await qrscan.scan(); // Start scanning
    setState(() {
      result = scannedData; // Update the result with scanned data
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('QR Code Scanner'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              result, // Display the scanned result
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: scanQRCode, // Trigger the scan on button press
              child: Text('Scan QR Code'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home screen is set to QRScanHome, which is a stateful widget.
// 4. In QRScanHome, the state is managed by _QRScanHomeState.
// 5. The initial result is set to "Scan a QR code".
// 6. When the user presses the "Scan QR Code" button, the scanQRCode function is called.
// 7. The scanQRCode function uses the qrscan package to scan a QR code and updates the result.
// 8. The scanned result is displayed on the screen.
```
