# Responsive Context: A Flutter Package for Responsive Design

The `responsive_context` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to create responsive applications that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and orientations. This package simplifies the process of building layouts that look great on both mobile and tablet devices, ensuring a consistent user experience across various platforms.

## When to Use This Package
- **Adaptive UI**: When you want your app to look good on multiple screen sizes without manually adjusting layouts.
- **Dynamic Content**: If your app displays content that varies in size or quantity, this package helps manage the layout effectively.
- **Cross-Platform Development**: Ideal for developers targeting both Android and iOS platforms, ensuring a uniform design approach.

## Key Features
- **Responsive Sizing**: Easily define sizes that adapt based on the screen dimensions.
- **Orientation Awareness**: Automatically adjust layouts based on the device's orientation (portrait or landscape).
- **Flexible Widgets**: Use built-in widgets that respond to screen size changes, making it easier to create fluid layouts.

Overall, `responsive_context` is an essential package for any Flutter developer aiming to enhance the responsiveness of their applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Responsive Context

## Installation
To get started with the `responsive_context` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and include the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  responsive_context: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No specific configurations are required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package
To use the `responsive_context` package, you need to wrap your application with the `ResponsiveContext` widget. This widget provides the necessary context for responsive design.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:responsive_context/responsive_context.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ResponsiveContext(
      child: MaterialApp(
        home: RealFlutter(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `ResponsiveContext` widget wraps the `MaterialApp`, allowing all child widgets to access responsive features.

# Complete Example of Responsive Context

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:responsive_context/responsive_context.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ResponsiveContext(
      child: MaterialApp(
        home: RealFlutter(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Get the responsive context
    final responsive = Responsive.of(context);

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Responsive Context Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display a responsive text widget
            Text(
              'Screen Width: ${responsive.width}px',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: responsive.isMobile ? 20 : 30),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Display a responsive button
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action when button is pressed
              },
              child: Text('Press Me'),
              style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
                padding: EdgeInsets.symmetric(
                  horizontal: responsive.isMobile ? 20 : 40,
                  vertical: 10,
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp wraps the MaterialApp with ResponsiveContext, enabling responsive features.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget builds the main UI.
// 4. Inside RealFlutter, we access the responsive context to get screen width and check if the device is mobile.
// 5. A Text widget displays the current screen width, adjusting its font size based on the device type.
// 6. An ElevatedButton is created with responsive padding, ensuring it looks good on all devices.
// 7. The app is structured to adapt its layout and styling based on the screen size, providing a responsive user experience.
