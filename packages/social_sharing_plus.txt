// The app starts by running the `main` function, which creates a new instance of the `MyApp` widget.
// The `MyApp` widget is a stateless widget that returns a `MaterialApp` widget with a title and a theme.
// The `MaterialApp` widget is the root widget of the app, and it contains a `MyHomePage` widget as its child.
// The `MyHomePage` widget is a stateful widget that returns a `Scaffold` widget with an app bar and a body.
// The body of the `Scaffold` widget contains a `Center` widget with a `Column` widget as its child.
// The `Column` widget contains three `ElevatedButton` widgets, each with a different label and a different `onPressed` callback.
// When the user presses one of the buttons, the corresponding `onPressed` callback is called, which shares the text or image on the specified social media platform.
