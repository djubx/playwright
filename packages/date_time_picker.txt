# Date Time Picker Flutter Package

The `date_time_picker` Flutter package is a versatile and user-friendly widget that allows developers to easily implement date and time selection in their Flutter applications.

- **Date and Time Selection**: Users can select both date and time in a single widget.
- **Localization Support**: The package supports multiple languages and formats, making it suitable for international applications.
- **Validation**: Built-in validation ensures that the selected date and time meet specified criteria.

## When to Use
You should consider using the `date_time_picker` package when:
- Your application requires users to select dates and times.
- You want a consistent and customizable date/time picker across different platforms (iOS and Android).
- You need to handle localization for different regions.

# Tutorial: Setting Up the Date Time Picker Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the `date_time_picker` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  date_time_picker: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install the Package
Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to configure the `Info.plist` file to support localization if you are using it. Add the following keys if necessary:

```xml
<key>CFBundleLocalizations</key>
<array>
    <string>en</string>
    <string>es</string>
    <string>fr</string>
</array>
```

## Step 4: Import the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:date_time_picker/date_time_picker.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Date Time Picker
You can now use the `DateTimePicker` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
DateTimePicker(
  type: DateTimePickerType.dateTime,
  dateLabelText: 'Date',
  timeLabelText: "Hour",
  onChanged: (val) => print(val),
  validator: (val) {
    return null;
  },
),
```

This widget allows users to select both date and time, and you can handle the selected value in the `onChanged` callback.

# Complete Example of Date Time Picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:date_time_picker/date_time_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Date Time Picker Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Date Time Picker Example'),
        ),
        body: DateTimePickerExample(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DateTimePickerExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DateTimePickerExampleState createState() => _DateTimePickerExampleState();
}

class _DateTimePickerExampleState extends State<DateTimePickerExample> {
  // Variable to hold the selected date and time
  String selectedDateTime = '';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
      child: Column(
        children: [
          // DateTimePicker widget for selecting date and time
          DateTimePicker(
            type: DateTimePickerType.dateTime,
            dateLabelText: 'Date',
            timeLabelText: "Hour",
            onChanged: (val) {
              // Update the selected date and time
              setState(() {
                selectedDateTime = val;
              });
            },
            validator: (val) {
              // Validate the selected date and time
              if (val == null || val.isEmpty) {
                return 'Please select a date and time';
              }
              return null;
            },
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20),
          // Display the selected date and time
          Text(
            'Selected Date and Time: $selectedDateTime',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation
// The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget sets up a MaterialApp with a title and a home scaffold.
// Inside the scaffold, we have an AppBar and a body that contains the DateTimePickerExample widget.
// The DateTimePickerExample is a stateful widget that maintains the selected date and time.
// The DateTimePicker widget is used to allow users to select both date and time.
// When the user selects a date and time, the onChanged callback updates the selectedDateTime variable.
// The selected date and time are displayed below the picker in a Text widget.
// The validator ensures that the user selects a date and time before proceeding.
