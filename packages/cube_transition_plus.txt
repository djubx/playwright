# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Cube Transition Plus

## Installation
To get started with `cube_transition_plus`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cube_transition_plus: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/cube_transition_plus).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No specific configurations are required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package
To use the `cube_transition_plus` package, you will typically wrap your page navigation in a `CubePageTransition` widget. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cube_transition_plus/cube_transition_plus.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: FirstPage(),
    );
  }
}

class FirstPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('First Page')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            Navigator.of(context).push(
              CubePageTransition(
                page: SecondPage(),
                duration: Duration(milliseconds: 600),
              ),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Go to Second Page'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SecondPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Second Page')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Welcome to the Second Page!')),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button on the `FirstPage` is pressed, it navigates to the `SecondPage` with a cube transition effect.

# Complete Example of Cube Transition Plus

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cube_transition_plus/cube_transition_plus.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Cube Transition Plus Example',
      home: FirstPage(),
    );
  }
}

class FirstPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('First Page')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate to the SecondPage with a cube transition
            Navigator.of(context).push(
              CubePageTransition(
                page: SecondPage(), // The page to navigate to
                duration: Duration(milliseconds: 600), // Duration of the transition
              ),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Go to Second Page'), // Button text
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SecondPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Second Page')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to the Second Page!'), // Display text on the second page
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The home of the app is set to FirstPage, which contains a button.
// 3. When the button is pressed, it triggers the Navigator to push a new route.
// 4. The CubePageTransition widget is used to create a cube transition effect to SecondPage.
// 5. The SecondPage displays a simple message and has its own AppBar.
```

# Summary
In this example, we demonstrated how to implement the `cube_transition_plus` package in a Flutter application.
