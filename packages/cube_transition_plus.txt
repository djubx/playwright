// The app starts by running the main function, which creates a MaterialApp with a title and a theme.
// The home of the MaterialApp is set to the RealFlutter class, which is a StatefulWidget.
// The RealFlutter class creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Centered ElevatedButton.
// When the ElevatedButton is pressed, it navigates to the next page using the CubeTransition.
// The CubeTransition creates a cube transition effect between the current page and the next page.
// The next page is created by the NextPage class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// The NextPage class creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Centered Text.
