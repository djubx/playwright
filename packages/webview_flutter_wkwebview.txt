# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `webview_flutter_wkwebview`

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `webview_flutter_wkwebview` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `webview_flutter_wkwebview` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  webview_flutter_wkwebview: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/webview_flutter_wkwebview).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following keys to allow App Transport Security (ATS) for HTTP requests:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

3. Ensure that your deployment target is set to at least iOS 9.0.

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 19 // Ensure this is set to at least 19
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a WebView using the `webview_flutter_wkwebview` package.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:webview_flutter_wkwebview/webview_flutter_wkwebview.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'WebView Example',
      home: WebViewExample(),
    );
  }
}

class WebViewExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _WebViewExampleState createState() => _WebViewExampleState();
}

class _WebViewExampleState extends State<WebViewExample> {
  late WebViewController _controller; // Controller to manage the WebView
  final String _url = 'https://flutter.dev'; // URL to load in the WebView

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('WebView Example'),
        actions: [
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.arrow_back),
            onPressed: () async {
              if (await _controller.canGoBack()) {
                _controller.goBack(); // Navigate back if possible
              }
            },
          ),
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.arrow_forward),
            onPressed: () async {
              if (await _controller.canGoForward()) {
                _controller.goForward(); // Navigate forward if possible
              }
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
      body: WebView(
        initialUrl: _url, // Load the initial URL
        onWebViewCreated: (WebViewController webViewController) {
          _controller = webViewController; // Initialize the controller
        },
        javascriptMode: JavascriptMode.unrestricted, // Enable JavaScript
        onPageFinished: (String url) {
          print('Page finished loading: $url'); // Log when the page finishes loading
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home page.
// 3. The WebViewExample widget creates a stateful widget to manage the WebView.
// 4. The WebView is initialized with a URL and a controller to manage navigation.
// 5. The AppBar contains buttons to navigate back and forward in the WebView history.
// 6. The WebView loads the specified URL and allows JavaScript execution.
// 7. The onPageFinished callback logs the URL of the page once it has finished loading.
```
