# Flutter Login Template: Setup and Usage Tutorial

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_login_template` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter project.

## Installation

To add the `flutter_login_template` package to your Flutter project, follow these steps:

1. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file.
2. Add the package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     flutter_login_template: ^latest_version
   ```

3. Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
- Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS
- Open the `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add any necessary permissions for network access if you plan to connect to an API for authentication.

## Using the Package

To use the `flutter_login_template`, you can create a new Dart file (e.g., `login_screen.dart`) and implement the login UI as follows:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_login_template/flutter_login_template.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Login Template',
      home: LoginScreen(), // Use the LoginScreen widget from the package
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application that uses the `LoginScreen` widget provided by the `flutter_login_template` package.

# Complete Example of Flutter Login Template

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_login_template/flutter_login_template.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Start the app with the RealFlutter widget
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Login Template',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue, // Set the primary color of the app
      ),
      home: LoginScreen(), // Display the login screen
    );
  }
}

// The LoginScreen widget handles user authentication
class LoginScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Login'), // Title of the login screen
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              TextField( // Input field for email
                decoration: InputDecoration(
                  labelText: 'Email',
                  border: OutlineInputBorder(),
                ),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 16), // Space between fields
              TextField( // Input field for password
                decoration: InputDecoration(
                  labelText: 'Password',
                  border: OutlineInputBorder(),
                ),
                obscureText: true, // Hide password input
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 16), // Space between fields
              ElevatedButton( // Login button
                onPressed: () {
                  // Handle login logic here
                  print('Login button pressed');
                },
                child: Text('Login'),
              ),
              TextButton( // Link to registration screen
                onPressed: () {
                  // Navigate to registration screen
                  print('Navigate to registration');
                },
                child: Text('Don\'t have an account? Register'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
3. The home property of the MaterialApp is set to LoginScreen, which displays the login UI.
4. The LoginScreen contains two TextFields for email and password input.
5. An ElevatedButton is provided for the user to submit their login credentials.
6. A TextButton is included to navigate to the registration screen if the user does not have an account.
7. The app prints messages to the console when buttons are pressed, which can be replaced with actual navigation and authentication logic.
