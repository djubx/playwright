# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Build Web Compilers

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `build_web_compilers` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter web project.

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Flutter Environment

Before you begin, ensure that you have Flutter installed on your machine. You can check your installation by running:

```bash
flutter doctor
```

Make sure you have the Flutter SDK and the Dart SDK installed.

## Step 2: Creating a New Flutter Web Project

To create a new Flutter web project, run the following command:

```bash
flutter create my_web_app
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd my_web_app
```

## Step 3: Adding the Build Web Compilers Package

Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `build_web_compilers` package under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  build_web_compilers: ^3.2.0
```

Run the following command to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 4: Configuring the Build System

To configure the build system for web compilation, create a new file named `build.yaml` in the root of your project and add the following configuration:

```yaml
targets:
  $default:
    builders:
      build_web_compilers|entrypoint:
        options:
          dart2js_args:
            - --minify
```

This configuration enables minification of the JavaScript output, which can improve load times.

## Step 5: Running Your Flutter Web Application

To run your Flutter web application, use the following command:

```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

This command will launch your application in the Chrome browser, allowing you to see your changes in real-time.

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that you have the latest version of Android Studio and the Android SDK installed. The `build_web_compilers` package does not require any specific configurations for Android, as it primarily targets web applications.

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that you have Xcode installed. Similar to Android, there are no specific configurations required for using the `build_web_compilers` package, as it focuses on web compilation.

By following these steps, you can successfully set up and use the `build_web_compilers` package in your Flutter web projects.

# Complete Example: Flutter Web Application Using Build Web Compilers

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

// Main entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// The main widget of the application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Web Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

// Home page widget
class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Build Web Compilers Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Welcome to Flutter Web!',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action when button is pressed
                showDialog(
                  context: context,
                  builder: (BuildContext context) {
                    return AlertDialog(
                      title: Text('Hello!'),
                      content: Text('This is a simple Flutter web app.'),
                      actions: <Widget>[
                        TextButton(
                          child: Text('Close'),
                          onPressed: () {
                            Navigator.of(context).pop();
                          },
                        ),
                      ],
                    );
                  },
                );
              },
              child: Text('Show Message'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main() function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. runApp() initializes the app with the RealFlutter widget.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 4. The MaterialApp contains a title and a theme, and sets MyHomePage as the home widget.
// 5. MyHomePage is a StatelessWidget that builds the main UI.
// 6. The UI consists of an AppBar and a Center widget containing a Column.
// 7. The Column has a Text widget displaying a welcome message and an ElevatedButton.
// 8. When the button is pressed, an AlertDialog is shown with a message.
// 9. The AlertDialog has a close button that dismisses the dialog when pressed.
