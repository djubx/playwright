# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Smart Alert Dialog

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **smart_alert_dialog** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  smart_alert_dialog: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/smart_alert_dialog).

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configurations

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` file to allow for any specific permissions required by your dialogs, although the **smart_alert_dialog** package typically does not require special permissions.

## Step 4: Using the Package

To use the **smart_alert_dialog** package, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:smart_alert_dialog/smart_alert_dialog.dart';
```

You can then create and display a dialog using the following code snippet:

```dart
SmartAlertDialog.show(
  context: context,
  title: "Alert Title",
  message: "This is an alert message.",
  onConfirm: () {
    // Handle confirmation action
  },
);
```

This will display a simple alert dialog with a title and message, along with a confirmation button.

# Complete Example of Smart Alert Dialog

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:smart_alert_dialog/smart_alert_dialog.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Smart Alert Dialog Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Smart Alert Dialog Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Trigger the alert dialog when the button is pressed
            SmartAlertDialog.show(
              context: context,
              title: "Confirmation",
              message: "Do you want to proceed?",
              onConfirm: () {
                // Action to perform on confirmation
                Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                // Show a success message
                SmartAlertDialog.show(
                  context: context,
                  title: "Success",
                  message: "You have confirmed the action!",
                );
              },
              onCancel: () {
                // Action to perform on cancellation
                Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                // Show a cancellation message
                SmartAlertDialog.show(
                  context: context,
                  title: "Cancelled",
                  message: "You have cancelled the action.",
                );
              },
            );
          },
          child: Text('Show Alert Dialog'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget contains a button that, when pressed, triggers the SmartAlertDialog.
// 4. The dialog asks the user for confirmation with "Do you want to proceed?".
// 5. If the user confirms, a success dialog is shown; if they cancel, a cancellation dialog is displayed.
// 6. Each dialog can be closed by calling Navigator.of(context).pop(), which removes it from the screen.
```
