# Popup Menu Flutter Package

The `popup_menu` Flutter package is a versatile tool that allows developers to create customizable popup menus in their Flutter applications. This package is particularly useful for applications that require context-sensitive menus, such as settings, actions, or options that are relevant to the current state of the application.

- **Contextual Actions**: When you want to provide users with options that are relevant to a specific item or context, such as editing or deleting an item in a list.
- **Settings and Preferences**: For applications that require user settings, a popup menu can provide a clean and efficient way to present options without cluttering the UI.
- **Dynamic Content**: When the options available in the menu need to change based on user interactions or application state.

## Features

- **Customizable Appearance**: You can easily customize the look and feel of the popup menu to match your application's theme.
- **Flexible Item Handling**: The package allows for dynamic item creation, enabling you to populate the menu based on the current context.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Popup Menu Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `popup_menu` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  popup_menu: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Popup Menu

To use the `popup_menu` package, you can create a simple widget that displays a button. When the button is pressed, a popup menu will appear with various options.

Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to implement a popup menu:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:popup_menu/popup_menu.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Popup Menu Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Define the menu items
              List<PopupMenuEntry<String>> menuItems = [
                PopupMenuItem<String>(value: 'edit', child: Text('Edit')),
                PopupMenuItem<String>(value: 'delete', child: Text('Delete')),
                PopupMenuItem<String>(value: 'share', child: Text('Share')),
              ];

              // Show the popup menu
              showMenu(
                context: context,
                position: RelativeRect.fromLTRB(100, 100, 0, 0),
                items: menuItems,
              ).then((value) {
                // Handle the selected value
                if (value != null) {
                  print('Selected: $value');
                }
              });
            },
            child: Text('Show Popup Menu'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, a popup menu appears with three options: Edit, Delete, and Share. The selected option is printed to the console.

# Complete Example of Popup Menu in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:popup_menu/popup_menu.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Popup Menu Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Define the menu items
              List<PopupMenuEntry<String>> menuItems = [
                PopupMenuItem<String>(value: 'edit', child: Text('Edit')),
                PopupMenuItem<String>(value: 'delete', child: Text('Delete')),
                PopupMenuItem<String>(value: 'share', child: Text('Share')),
              ];

              // Show the popup menu
              showMenu(
                context: context,
                position: RelativeRect.fromLTRB(100, 100, 0, 0),
                items: menuItems,
              ).then((value) {
                // Handle the selected value
                if (value != null) {
                  print('Selected: $value');
                }
              });
            },
            child: Text('Show Popup Menu'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The MaterialApp widget is created, containing a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is displayed.
// 4. When the button is pressed, a list of PopupMenuEntry items is defined.
// 5. The showMenu function is called to display the popup menu at a specified position.
// 6. When an item is selected from the menu, the selected value is printed to the console.
// 7. This allows for dynamic handling of user actions based on the selected menu item.
