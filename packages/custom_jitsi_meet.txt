# Tutorial: Setting Up Custom Jitsi Meet

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `custom_jitsi_meet` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Package to Your Project
To get started, add the `custom_jitsi_meet` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  custom_jitsi_meet: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/custom_jitsi_meet).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version required
    }
}
```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera for video calls.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio calls.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a video call using the `custom_jitsi_meet` package.

# Complete Example of Custom Jitsi Meet

Here is a complete example of a Flutter application that demonstrates the key features of the `custom_jitsi_meet` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:custom_jitsi_meet/custom_jitsi_meet.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Custom Jitsi Meet Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  // Function to start a Jitsi meeting
  void _startMeeting(BuildContext context) {
    // Define the meeting options
    var options = JitsiMeetingOptions(room: "testRoom")
      ..userDisplayName = "User Name"
      ..userEmail = "user@example.com"
      ..userAvatarURL = "https://example.com/avatar.png"
      ..audioMuted = false
      ..videoMuted = false;

    // Start the meeting
    JitsiMeet.joinMeeting(options);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Jitsi Meet Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () => _startMeeting(context), // Start meeting on button press
          child: Text('Start Meeting'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget displays a button to start a meeting.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the _startMeeting function is called.
// 5. Inside _startMeeting, we create a JitsiMeetingOptions object with the room name and user details.
// 6. Finally, we call JitsiMeet.joinMeeting with the options to start the video call.
```
