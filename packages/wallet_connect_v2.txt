# Tutorial: Setting Up Wallet Connect V2 in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `wallet_connect_v2` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

First, add the `wallet_connect_v2` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  wallet_connect_v2: ^2.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. Ensure your iOS deployment target is set to at least 11.0 in `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '11.0'
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now, let's create a simple Flutter application that uses the `wallet_connect_v2` package.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:wallet_connect_v2/wallet_connect_v2.dart';
```

2. Initialize the WalletConnect instance and set up the connection:

```dart
final connector = WalletConnect(
  bridge: 'https://bridge.walletconnect.org', // WalletConnect bridge URL
  clientMeta: const PeerMeta(
    name: 'RealFlutter',
    description: 'A Flutter app using WalletConnect',
    url: 'https://realflutter.dev',
    icons: ['https://example.com/icon.png'],
  ),
);
```

3. Connect to a wallet:

```dart
if (!connector.connected) {
  final session = await connector.createSession(onDisplayUri: (uri) {
    // Display the URI to the user for scanning
    print(uri);
  });
}
```

4. Handle transactions and disconnections as needed.

# Complete Example: RealFlutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:wallet_connect_v2/wallet_connect_v2.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Wallet Connect V2 Example',
      home: WalletConnectHome(),
    );
  }
}

class WalletConnectHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _WalletConnectHomeState createState() => _WalletConnectHomeState();
}

class _WalletConnectHomeState extends State<WalletConnectHome> {
  late WalletConnect connector; // Declare the WalletConnect instance
  String? sessionUri; // Store the session URI

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the WalletConnect instance
    connector = WalletConnect(
      bridge: 'https://bridge.walletconnect.org',
      clientMeta: const PeerMeta(
        name: 'RealFlutter',
        description: 'A Flutter app using WalletConnect',
        url: 'https://realflutter.dev',
        icons: ['https://example.com/icon.png'],
      ),
    );

    // Check if already connected
    if (connector.connected) {
      print('Already connected');
    }
  }

  // Function to create a new session
  void _createSession() async {
    if (!connector.connected) {
      // Create a new session and display the URI
      final session = await connector.createSession(onDisplayUri: (uri) {
        setState(() {
          sessionUri = uri; // Update the session URI
        });
        print(uri); // Print the URI for the user to scan
      });
      print('Session created: ${session.accounts}');
    }
  }

  // Function to disconnect the session
  void _disconnect() {
    connector.killSession();
    setState(() {
      sessionUri = null; // Clear the session URI
    });
    print('Disconnected');
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Wallet Connect V2 Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            if (sessionUri != null) ...[
              Text('Scan this QR code:'),
              // Display the session URI as a QR code (placeholder)
              Text(sessionUri!),
            ],
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _createSession,
              child: Text('Connect Wallet'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _disconnect,
              child: Text('Disconnect Wallet'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and home widget.
// 3. The WalletConnectHome widget initializes the WalletConnect instance in initState.
// 4. If the connector is not already connected, the user can create a session by pressing the "Connect Wallet" button.
// 5. When the session is created, a URI is displayed for the user to scan with their wallet app.
// 6. The user can disconnect the wallet by pressing the "Disconnect Wallet" button, which clears the session URI.
```
