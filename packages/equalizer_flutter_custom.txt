# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using equalizer_flutter_custom

## Installation
To get started with `equalizer_flutter_custom`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  equalizer_flutter_custom: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/equalizer_flutter_custom).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following key to request microphone access:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio processing.</string>
```

## Using the Package
Once you have installed the package and configured your project, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the equalizer.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:equalizer_flutter_custom/equalizer_flutter_custom.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  Equalizer equalizer;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    equalizer = Equalizer();
    equalizer.init();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    equalizer.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  void setEqualizerBand(int band, double value) {
    equalizer.setBandLevel(band, value);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Equalizer Example')),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Add sliders for each frequency band
          Slider(
            value: equalizer.getBandLevel(0),
            min: -15,
            max: 15,
            onChanged: (value) => setEqualizerBand(0, value),
          ),
          // Repeat for other bands...
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize the equalizer, set up a slider for one of the frequency bands, and allow users to adjust the band level in real-time.

# Complete Example of equalizer_flutter_custom

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:equalizer_flutter_custom/equalizer_flutter_custom.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  Equalizer equalizer; // Declare an Equalizer instance

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    equalizer = Equalizer(); // Initialize the Equalizer
    equalizer.init(); // Call the init method to set up the equalizer
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    equalizer.dispose(); // Dispose of the equalizer when done
    super.dispose();
  }

  // Method to set the level of a specific band
  void setEqualizerBand(int band, double value) {
    equalizer.setBandLevel(band, value); // Set the band level
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Equalizer Example')), // App bar title
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Slider for the first frequency band
          Slider(
            value: equalizer.getBandLevel(0), // Get current level for band 0
            min: -15, // Minimum value for the slider
            max: 15, // Maximum value for the slider
            onChanged: (value) => setEqualizerBand(0, value), // Update band level on change
          ),
          // Repeat sliders for other frequency bands as needed...
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The RealFlutter widget is created, initializing the Equalizer instance.
// 2. The initState method is called, where the equalizer is initialized.
// 3. The build method constructs the UI, including a slider for the first frequency band.
// 4. When the slider is moved, the setEqualizerBand method is called, updating the equalizer's band level.
// 5. The dispose method ensures that resources are cleaned up when the widget is removed from the widget tree.
