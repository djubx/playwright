# Tutorial
==========

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process and explain how to use the `timer_button_fork` package in your Flutter application.

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Pubspec.yaml File

To use the `timer_button_fork` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under the `dependencies` section:

```yml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  timer_button_fork: ^1.0.0
```

### Step 2: Import the Package in Your Dart File

To use the `timer_button_fork` package, you need to import it in your Dart file. Open your Dart file and add the following line at the top:

```dart
import 'package:timer_button_fork/timer_button_fork.dart';
```

### Step 3: Create a Timer Button

To create a timer button, you can use the `TimerButton` widget provided by the `timer_button_fork` package. Here is an example of how to create a timer button:

```dart
TimerButton(
  label: 'Click Me',
  onPressed: () {
    print('Button pressed');
  },
  timeOutInSeconds: 10,
)
```

In this example, we create a timer button with the label 'Click Me'. When the button is pressed, it will print 'Button pressed' to the console. The `timeOutInSeconds` property is used to set the timer duration in seconds.

### Platform-Specific Details

The `timer_button_fork` package works on both Android and iOS platforms. However, you need to make sure that you have the necessary permissions to use the timer on each platform.

On Android, you need to add the following permission to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK" />
```

On iOS, you need to add the following permission to your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
  <string>processing</string>
</array>
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:timer_button_fork/timer_button_fork.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Timer Button Fork Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(

      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            TimerButton(
              label: 'Click Me',
              onPressed: () {
                print('Button pressed');
              },
              timeOutInSeconds: 10,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(
              'Click the button to start the timer. The button will be disabled for 10 seconds after it is pressed.',
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user clicks the 'Click Me' button.
// 2. The button is disabled for 10 seconds.
// 3. After 10 seconds, the button is enabled again.
// 4. The user can click the button again to start the timer.
// 5. Steps 2-4 repeat indefinitely.
