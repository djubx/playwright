# Flutter Lazy Indexed Stack Package

The `flutter_lazy_indexed_stack` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to optimize their applications by efficiently managing the rendering of widgets. This package allows you to create a stack of widgets where only the currently visible widget is built, while the others are lazily built when they come into view. This can significantly improve performance, especially in scenarios where you have a large number of widgets that are not always visible on the screen.

## When to Use

You should consider using `flutter_lazy_indexed_stack` in the following scenarios:

- **Large Lists of Widgets**: When you have a large number of widgets that are not all visible at once, such as in tabbed interfaces or multi-page applications.
- **Performance Optimization**: If your application is experiencing performance issues due to the number of widgets being built at once, this package can help mitigate that.
- **Dynamic Content**: When the content of your widgets changes frequently, and you want to avoid unnecessary rebuilds of off-screen widgets.

## Features

- **Lazy Loading**: Only builds the currently visible widget, improving performance.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that integrates seamlessly with existing Flutter applications.
- **Customizable**: Allows for customization of the stack behavior and appearance.

Overall, `flutter_lazy_indexed_stack` is an excellent choice for Flutter developers looking to enhance the performance and efficiency of their applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_lazy_indexed_stack

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with `flutter_lazy_indexed_stack`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_lazy_indexed_stack: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_lazy_indexed_stack/flutter_lazy_indexed_stack.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Lazy Indexed Stack

You can now use the `LazyIndexedStack` widget in your application. Below is a simple example of how to implement it:

### Android and iOS Specific Configurations

For both Android and iOS, no additional configurations are required to use `flutter_lazy_indexed_stack`. However, ensure that your Flutter SDK is up to date to avoid compatibility issues.

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use `LazyIndexedStack` in your Flutter application:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_lazy_indexed_stack/flutter_lazy_indexed_stack.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  int _currentIndex = 0;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Lazy Indexed Stack Example'),
      ),
      body: LazyIndexedStack(
        index: _currentIndex,
        children: [
          Center(child: Text('Page 1')),
          Center(child: Text('Page 2')),
          Center(child: Text('Page 3')),
        ],
      ),
      bottomNavigationBar: BottomNavigationBar(
        currentIndex: _currentIndex,
        onTap: (index) {
          setState(() {
            _currentIndex = index; // Update the current index
          });
        },
        items: [
          BottomNavigationBarItem(icon: Icon(Icons.home), label: 'Home'),
          BottomNavigationBarItem(icon: Icon(Icons.business), label: 'Business'),
          BottomNavigationBarItem(icon: Icon(Icons.school), label: 'School'),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple app with three pages. The `LazyIndexedStack` widget is used to manage the visibility of these pages based on the selected index from the bottom navigation bar.

# Complete Example of flutter_lazy_indexed_stack

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_lazy_indexed_stack/flutter_lazy_indexed_stack.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// MyApp is the root widget of the application
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: RealFlutter(), // Launching the RealFlutter widget
    );
  }
}

// RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that manages the current index of the LazyIndexedStack
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  int _currentIndex = 0; // Variable to keep track of the current index

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Lazy Indexed Stack Example'), // Title of the app
      ),
      body: LazyIndexedStack(
        index: _currentIndex, // Current index to display the corresponding widget
        children: [
          Center(child: Text('Page 1')), // First page content
          Center(child: Text('Page 2')), // Second page content
          Center(child: Text('Page 3')), // Third page content
        ],
      ),
      bottomNavigationBar: BottomNavigationBar(
        currentIndex: _currentIndex, // Highlight the current index in the navigation bar
        onTap: (index) {
          setState(() {
            _currentIndex = index; // Update the current index when a tab is tapped
          });
        },
        items: [
          BottomNavigationBarItem(icon: Icon(Icons.home), label: 'Home'), // Home tab
          BottomNavigationBarItem(icon: Icon(Icons.business), label: 'Business'), // Business tab
          BottomNavigationBarItem(icon: Icon(Icons.school), label: 'School'), // School tab
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains the current index of the LazyIndexedStack.
4. The LazyIndexedStack displays the widget corresponding to the current index.
5. The BottomNavigationBar allows users to switch between different pages.
6. When a tab is tapped, the onTap callback updates the current index, triggering a rebuild of the widget tree.
7. The LazyIndexedStack then builds the widget for the new index, while the off-screen widgets remain unbuilt until needed.
