// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user clicks the "Load RDF Data" button, which loads RDF data from a file.
// 2. The RDF data is parsed and stored in the `_graph` variable.
// 3. The user clicks the "Query RDF Data" button, which executes a SPARQL query on the RDF data.
// 4. The query results are printed to the console.

// The rdflib package is used to parse and query the RDF data.
// The `RdfGraph` class is used to store the RDF data.
// The `RdfParserSettings` class is used to configure the parser settings.
// The `RdfQueryResult` class is used to store the query results.
