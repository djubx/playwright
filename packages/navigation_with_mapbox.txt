# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Navigation with Mapbox Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `navigation_with_mapbox` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `navigation_with_mapbox` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  navigation_with_mapbox: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version
        ...
    }
}
```

2. Add the required permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.yourapp">

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/>

    <application
        ...
        android:usesCleartextTraffic="true">
        ...
    </application>
</manifest>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys for location permissions:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to provide navigation services.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to provide navigation services.</string>
```

2. Ensure you have the latest version of Xcode and the necessary iOS SDKs.

## Step 3: Initialize Mapbox

In your Flutter application, you need to initialize Mapbox with your access token. You can obtain an access token from the Mapbox website.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:navigation_with_mapbox/navigation_with_mapbox.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  MapboxNavigation.onNativeViewCreated = (controller) {
    // Initialize Mapbox with your access token
    controller.initialize("YOUR_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN");
  };
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the `navigation_with_mapbox` package to create a navigation experience. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set up a basic navigation screen.

# Complete Example: Navigation with Mapbox

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:navigation_with_mapbox/navigation_with_mapbox.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  // Initialize Mapbox with your access token
  MapboxNavigation.onNativeViewCreated = (controller) {
    controller.initialize("YOUR_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN");
  };
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Mapbox Navigation Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: NavigationScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class NavigationScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _NavigationScreenState createState() => _NavigationScreenState();
}

class _NavigationScreenState extends State<NavigationScreen> {
  // Create a MapboxNavigation instance
  final MapboxNavigation _mapboxNavigation = MapboxNavigation();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Start navigation when the screen is initialized
    _startNavigation();
  }

  void _startNavigation() async {
    // Define the starting and ending coordinates
    var start = Location(37.7749, -122.4194); // San Francisco
    var end = Location(34.0522, -118.2437); // Los Angeles

    // Start navigation
    await _mapboxNavigation.startNavigation(
      origin: start,
      destination: end,
      mode: MapboxNavigationMode.driving,
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Mapbox Navigation'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Navigation in progress...'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts by initializing the Mapbox with the access token.
// 2. The main widget is `RealFlutter`, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. The `NavigationScreen` is displayed as the home screen.
// 4. In the `initState` method of `NavigationScreen`, the `_startNavigation` method is called.
// 5. The `_startNavigation` method defines the start and end locations and calls the `startNavigation` method of the MapboxNavigation instance.
// 6. The app displays a simple message indicating that navigation is in progress.
```
