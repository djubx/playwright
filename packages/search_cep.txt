# Overview of the search_cep Flutter Package

The `search_cep` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to facilitate the search of Brazilian postal codes (CEP - Código de Endereçamento Postal). This package allows developers to easily integrate postal code lookup functionality into their Flutter applications, making it particularly useful for apps that require address validation or auto-completion features.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `search_cep` package in scenarios such as:
- **E-commerce Applications**: To validate shipping addresses during checkout.
- **User Profile Management**: To allow users to quickly fill in their address details by searching for their postal code.
- **Location-Based Services**: To enhance user experience by providing location-specific information based on postal codes.

## Features

- **Easy Integration**: Simple to add to your Flutter project with minimal setup.
- **Real-time Search**: Provides real-time suggestions as users type in their postal code.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Customizable UI**: Allows developers to customize the appearance of the search results.

With these features, the `search_cep` package is an excellent choice for any Flutter application that requires postal code functionality.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the search_cep Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `search_cep` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  search_cep: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to access the internet. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following line inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` file to allow network requests. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `search_cep` functionality.

# Complete Example of Using search_cep

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:search_cep/search_cep.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'CEP Search Example',
      home: CepSearchScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class CepSearchScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CepSearchScreenState createState() => _CepSearchScreenState();
}

class _CepSearchScreenState extends State<CepSearchScreen> {
  final TextEditingController _cepController = TextEditingController();
  String _address = '';

  // Function to search for the address based on the entered CEP
  void _searchCep() async {
    // Get the entered CEP from the controller
    String cep = _cepController.text;

    // Use the search_cep package to fetch address details
    try {
      var result = await SearchCep().search(cep);
      setState(() {
        // Update the address state with the fetched result
        _address = result['logradouro'] + ', ' + result['bairro'] + ', ' + result['localidade'];
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during the search
      setState(() {
        _address = 'Error fetching address';
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Search CEP'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              controller: _cepController,
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Enter CEP',
                suffixIcon: IconButton(
                  icon: Icon(Icons.search),
                  onPressed: _searchCep, // Trigger the search when pressed
                ),
              ),
              keyboardType: TextInputType.number,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(
              _address.isEmpty ? 'Address will appear here' : _address,
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (CepSearchScreen).
// 3. CepSearchScreen contains a TextField for user input and a button to trigger the search.
// 4. When the user enters a CEP and presses the search button, the _searchCep function is called.
// 5. _searchCep retrieves the entered CEP, calls the search method from the search_cep package, and updates the address state.
// 6. The fetched address is displayed on the screen, or an error message is shown if the search fails.
