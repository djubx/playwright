// This is the main entry point of the app.
// The `RealFlutter` class is a stateful widget that creates a `DisposeBag` instance and adds a stream and an object to it.
// When the `dispose` method is called, the `DisposeBag` will dispose of the stream and the object automatically.

// The `MyObject` class is a simple object that implements the `Disposable` interface.
// When the `dispose` method is called, it prints a message to the console.

// The app uses the `MaterialApp` widget to create a material design app.
// The `Scaffold` widget is used to create a basic material design layout.
// The `AppBar` widget is used to create a top app bar.
// The `Text` widget is used to display a text message.

// When the app is run, it will display a simple material design layout with a top app bar and a text message.
// When the app is closed, the `DisposeBag` will dispose of the stream and the object automatically.
