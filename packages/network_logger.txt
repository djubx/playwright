Here's a detailed technical blog on the "network_logger" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Network Logger Flutter Package

The `network_logger` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that allows for easy logging of network requests and responses. This package is particularly useful for debugging and monitoring network activity in applications, providing insights into API calls, response times, and error handling.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `network_logger` package in scenarios such as:

- **Debugging API Calls**: When developing applications that rely heavily on network requests, logging these requests can help identify issues quickly.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Understanding the time taken for requests can help optimize the application's performance.
- **Error Tracking**: Capturing error responses can assist in diagnosing issues with backend services.

## Features

- **Request and Response Logging**: Automatically logs all outgoing requests and incoming responses.
- **Customizable Logging**: Allows developers to customize the logging format and level.
- **Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup process that can be integrated into existing Flutter applications.

By leveraging the `network_logger` package, developers can enhance their debugging capabilities and improve the overall quality of their applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Network Logger Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `network_logger` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  network_logger: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:network_logger/network_logger.dart';
```

## Step 3: Setting Up the Logger

You need to initialize the logger in your main application file. Here’s how to do it:

```dart
void main() {
  // Initialize the network logger
  NetworkLogger.init();
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 4: Using the Logger

You can log network requests by wrapping your HTTP calls with the logger. Here’s an example of how to log a GET request:

```dart
final response = await NetworkLogger.get('https://api.example.com/data');
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

#### iOS

For iOS, you may need to configure App Transport Security settings in your `Info.plist` if you are accessing non-HTTPS URLs:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 5: Customizing the Logger

You can customize the logging format and level by using the following methods:

```dart
NetworkLogger.setLogLevel(LogLevel.verbose); // Set the log level
NetworkLogger.setFormat(LogFormat.json); // Set the log format
```

With these steps, you can effectively set up and use the `network_logger` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using the Network Logger Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:network_logger/network_logger.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the network logger
  NetworkLogger.init();
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Network Logger Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  String _data = 'No data fetched yet';

  // Function to fetch data from the API
  Future<void> _fetchData() async {
    try {
      // Log the GET request
      final response = await NetworkLogger.get('https://api.example.com/data');
      // Update the state with the fetched data
      setState(() {
        _data = response.body; // Assuming response.body contains the data
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors
      setState(() {
        _data = 'Error fetching data: $e';
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Network Logger Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(_data), // Display the fetched data
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _fetchData, // Fetch data when button is pressed
              child: Text('Fetch Data'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the NetworkLogger and runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds the MaterialApp and sets HomeScreen as the home widget.
// 3. HomeScreen contains a button to fetch data from an API.
// 4. When the button is pressed, _fetchData is called, which logs the GET request.
// 5. The response is then displayed on the screen, or an error message is shown if the request fails.
```

// The application starts by initializing the `NetworkLogger` and running the `MyApp` widget. 
// The `MyApp` widget builds a simple UI with a button to fetch data from an API. 
// When the button is pressed, the `_fetchData` method is called, which performs a GET request 
// to the specified URL and logs the request using the `NetworkLogger`. 
// The response is then displayed on the screen, or an error message is shown if the request fails. 
// This flow allows developers to easily monitor network activity and debug issues effectively.
