# Overview of the `shelf_router_generator` Flutter Package

The `shelf_router_generator` is a powerful Flutter package designed to simplify the process of routing in Flutter applications. It leverages code generation to create a robust routing system, allowing developers to define routes in a more declarative manner. This package is particularly useful for large applications where managing routes can become cumbersome.

## When to Use This Package

- **Complex Applications**: If your Flutter app has numerous screens and complex navigation flows, this package can help manage routes efficiently.
- **Code Maintenance**: It reduces boilerplate code and enhances maintainability by generating routing code automatically.
- **Type Safety**: The package provides type-safe routing, minimizing runtime errors related to navigation.

## Key Features

- **Code Generation**: Automatically generates routing code based on your defined routes.
- **Type Safety**: Ensures that routes are type-checked at compile time.
- **Declarative Syntax**: Allows for a more readable and maintainable way to define routes.
- **Support for Nested Routes**: Easily manage nested navigation structures.

By using `shelf_router_generator`, developers can focus more on building features rather than managing navigation logic.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `shelf_router_generator`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `shelf_router_generator` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  shelf_router_generator: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Configuring Build Runner

Since `shelf_router_generator` uses code generation, you need to add `build_runner` and `shelf_router_generator` as dev dependencies:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  build_runner: ^latest_version
  shelf_router_generator: ^latest_version
```

## Step 3: Creating Your Routes

Create a new Dart file (e.g., `routes.dart`) to define your routes. Hereâ€™s an example:

```dart
import 'package:shelf_router_generator/shelf_router_generator.dart';

part 'routes.g.dart'; // This will be generated

@Router()
class RealFlutter {
  @Route('/home')
  Widget home() => HomeScreen();

  @Route('/settings')
  Widget settings() => SettingsScreen();
}
```

## Step 4: Running the Code Generator

Run the following command in your terminal to generate the routing code:

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build
```

This command will generate a file named `routes.g.dart` containing the necessary routing logic.

## Step 5: Using the Generated Routes

In your main application file, you can now use the generated routes:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'routes.dart'; // Import your routes

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Shelf Router Example',
      initialRoute: '/home',
      onGenerateRoute: RealFlutter().generateRoute,
    );
  }
}
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` is configured correctly to support the necessary permissions and features for your app.

### iOS

For iOS, make sure to check your `Info.plist` for any required configurations, especially if you are using deep linking.

## Optimizations

- **Performance**: Use `const` constructors for your widgets where possible to improve performance.
- **Testing**: Write unit tests for your routes to ensure they behave as expected.

By following these steps, you can effectively set up and use the `shelf_router_generator` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using `shelf_router_generator`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:shelf_router_generator/shelf_router_generator.dart';

part 'routes.g.dart'; // This will be generated

@Router()
class RealFlutter {
  // Define the home route
  @Route('/home')
  Widget home() => HomeScreen();

  // Define the settings route
  @Route('/settings')
  Widget settings() => SettingsScreen();

  // Generate the route based on the name
  Route<dynamic> generateRoute(RouteSettings settings) {
    // Use the generated route logic
    return Router.generateRoute(settings);
  }
}

// Home Screen Widget
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Welcome to the Home Screen!'),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Navigate to settings when button is pressed
                Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/settings');
              },
              child: Text('Go to Settings'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Settings Screen Widget
class SettingsScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Settings')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('This is the Settings Screen!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Main Application Widget
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// MyApp Widget
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Shelf Router Example',
      initialRoute: '/home', // Set the initial route
      onGenerateRoute: RealFlutter().generateRoute, // Use the generated route
    );
  }
}

/*
  Application Flow Explanation:
  1. The application starts with the `main()` function, which runs the `MyApp` widget.
  2. `MyApp` initializes the MaterialApp with the title and sets the initial route to '/home'.
  3. The `onGenerateRoute` property is set to the `generateRoute` method of the `RealFlutter` class.
  4. When the app starts, it navigates to the `HomeScreen` widget.
  5. The `HomeScreen` displays a welcome message and a button to navigate to the `SettingsScreen`.
  6. When the button is pressed, it calls `Navigator.pushNamed` with the route '/settings', which triggers the `generateRoute` method.
  7. The `generateRoute` method uses the generated routing logic to navigate to the `SettingsScreen`.
  8. The `SettingsScreen` is displayed, showing a simple message.
