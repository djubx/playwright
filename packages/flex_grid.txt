# Flex Grid Flutter Package
The `flex_grid` Flutter package is a powerful and flexible grid layout system that allows developers to create complex grid structures with ease. It provides a wide range of features, including customizable grid cell sizes, flexible row and column spans, and support for multiple grid layouts.

## When to Use
The `flex_grid` package is ideal for creating complex grid-based layouts, such as:

* Dashboard screens with multiple widgets
* Grid-based lists with variable-sized items
* Complex forms with multiple input fields

## Features

* Customizable grid cell sizes
* Flexible row and column spans
* Support for multiple grid layouts
* Automatic grid cell sizing
* Customizable grid padding and margin

# Setting Up the Flex Grid Package
To use the `flex_grid` package, follow these steps:

1. Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  flex_grid: ^1.0.0
```
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.
3. Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:flex_grid/flex_grid.dart';
```
## Platform-Specific Details
The `flex_grid` package works on both Android and iOS platforms. However, there are some platform-specific considerations to keep in mind:

* On Android, the package uses the `GridLayout` widget to render the grid. This means that the grid will automatically adapt to the screen size and orientation.
* On iOS, the package uses the `UICollectionView` widget to render the grid. This means that the grid will automatically adapt to the screen size and orientation, but may require additional configuration to handle complex grid layouts.

## Configurations and Optimizations
To get the most out of the `flex_grid` package, consider the following configurations and optimizations:

* Use the `FlexGridDelegate` class to customize the grid layout and cell sizing.
* Use the `FlexGridItem` class to customize the appearance and behavior of individual grid cells.
* Use the `FlexGridPadding` and `FlexGridMargin` classes to customize the padding and margin of the grid.

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a grid of three items.
// 2. The grid is rendered using the `FlexGrid` widget, which is configured with a `FlexGridDelegate` instance.
// 3. The `FlexGridDelegate` instance defines the grid layout and cell sizing.
// 4. The grid items are defined as a list of `FlexGridItem` instances, each of which contains a `Container` widget with a colored background and a centered text label.
// 5. The user can interact with the grid by tapping on individual items.
// 6. The grid automatically adapts to the screen size and orientation.

// In summary, the code flows as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a grid of three items.
// 2. The grid is rendered using the `FlexGrid` widget.
// 3. The user can interact with the grid by tapping on individual items.
// 4. The grid automatically adapts to the screen size and orientation.
