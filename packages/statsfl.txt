# Overview of the `statsfl` Flutter Package

The `statsfl` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers who need to monitor and analyze the performance of their applications. It provides real-time statistics on various performance metrics, such as frame rate, CPU usage, and memory consumption. This package is particularly useful during the development and testing phases, where understanding the performance characteristics of your app can lead to more efficient and responsive applications.

## When to Use `statsfl`

- **Performance Monitoring**: Use `statsfl` to keep an eye on your app's performance metrics in real-time. This is crucial for identifying bottlenecks and optimizing your app.
- **Debugging**: During the debugging process, `statsfl` can help you pinpoint performance issues that might not be immediately apparent.
- **Testing**: When testing your app on different devices, `statsfl` provides insights into how your app performs under various conditions.

## Features

- **Real-Time Statistics**: Displays frame rate, CPU usage, and memory consumption.
- **Customizable Display**: You can customize the appearance and behavior of the statistics overlay.
- **Lightweight**: Designed to have minimal impact on your app's performance.

# Setting Up and Using `statsfl` in Your Flutter Project

In this section, we'll walk through the process of setting up the `statsfl` package in a Flutter project and demonstrate how to use it effectively.

## Setup Process

### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add `statsfl` to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  statsfl: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the `statsfl` package:

```dart
import 'package:statsfl/statsfl.dart';
```

### Step 3: Wrap Your App with `StatsFl`

To start using `statsfl`, wrap your `MaterialApp` or `CupertinoApp` with the `StatsFl` widget. This will overlay the performance statistics on top of your app.

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(
    StatsFl(
      isEnabled: true,
      child: RealFlutter(),
    ),
  );
}
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

No additional configuration is required for Android. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 16 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

#### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least iOS 9.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
```

## Optimizations

- **Conditional Enabling**: You can enable or disable `statsfl` based on the build mode. For example, enable it only in debug mode:

  ```dart
  StatsFl(
    isEnabled: !kReleaseMode,
    child: RealFlutter(),
  );
  ```

# Complete Example of Using `statsfl` in a Flutter App

Below is a complete example of a Flutter app using the `statsfl` package. This example demonstrates how to integrate and utilize the package to monitor app performance.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:statsfl/statsfl.dart';

// Main entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(
    StatsFl(
      isEnabled: true, // Enable the stats overlay
      child: RealFlutter(), // The main application widget
    ),
  );
}

// Main application widget
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'StatsFL Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(), // Set the home page of the app
    );
  }
}

// Home page of the application
class HomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomePageState createState() => _HomePageState();
}

class _HomePageState extends State<HomePage> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('StatsFL Performance Monitor'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Performance statistics are displayed on the overlay.',
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Simulate a performance-intensive task
                for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
                  // Perform some calculations
                  double value = i * 0.5;
                }
              },
              child: Text('Run Intensive Task'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// Explanation of Application Flow
// The `main` function initializes the app by wrapping it with `StatsFl`, enabling the performance overlay.
// `RealFlutter` is the main widget, setting up a `MaterialApp` with a home page.
// `HomePage` is a stateful widget displaying a button to simulate a performance-intensive task.
// When the button is pressed, a loop runs a simple calculation to simulate load, allowing `statsfl` to display performance metrics.
