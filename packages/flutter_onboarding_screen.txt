# Complete Example of Flutter Onboarding Screen

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_onboarding_screen/flutter_onboarding_screen.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Onboarding Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(), // Entry point for the onboarding screen
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Define the onboarding pages
    final pages = [
      OnboardingPage(
        title: 'Welcome to Our App',
        description: 'This is a brief introduction to our app.',
        image: 'assets/images/welcome.png', // Add your image path
      ),
      OnboardingPage(
        title: 'Discover Features',
        description: 'Explore the amazing features we offer.',
        image: 'assets/images/features.png', // Add your image path
      ),
      OnboardingPage(
        title: 'Get Started',
        description: 'Let\'s get started with your journey!',
        image: 'assets/images/get_started.png', // Add your image path
      ),
    ];

    // Return the onboarding screen widget
    return OnboardingScreen(
      pages: pages,
      onFinish: () {
        // Navigate to the main application screen after onboarding
        Navigator.of(context).pushReplacement(
          MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => MainScreen()),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

class MainScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Main Application Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to the main app!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The home property of MaterialApp is set to RealFlutter, which contains the onboarding logic.
// 3. In RealFlutter, we define a list of OnboardingPage objects, each representing a page in the onboarding process.
// 4. The OnboardingScreen widget is created with the list of pages and an onFinish callback.
// 5. When the user completes the onboarding, they are navigated to the MainScreen, which represents the main application.
// 6. The MainScreen displays a simple welcome message, indicating that the user has successfully completed the onboarding process.
```
