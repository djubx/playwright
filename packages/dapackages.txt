# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using "dapackages"

## Installation

To get started with "dapackages", you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and include the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dapackages: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage

To use "dapackages" in your Flutter application, you can import it as follows:

```dart
import 'package:dapackages/dapackages.dart';
```

You can then utilize its features, such as creating a simple button or making a network request. Hereâ€™s a quick example of how to create a button using "dapackages":

```dart
RealFlutter(
  child: DAPButton(
    onPressed: () {
      // Handle button press
    },
    child: Text('Click Me'),
  ),
);
```

This example demonstrates how easy it is to create a button with the package's built-in widget. You can customize the button's appearance and behavior as needed.

# Complete Example of Using "dapackages"

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dapackages/dapackages.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dapackages Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _data = 'No data fetched yet';

  // Function to fetch data from a sample API
  void _fetchData() async {
    // Using the DAPackage's networking utility to fetch data
    final response = await DAPNetwork.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1');
    
    // Check if the response is successful
    if (response.statusCode == 200) {
      setState(() {
        // Update the state with the fetched data
        _data = response.body['title'];
      });
    } else {
      setState(() {
        _data = 'Failed to fetch data';
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Dapackages Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(_data), // Display fetched data
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            DAPButton(
              onPressed: _fetchData, // Fetch data on button press
              child: Text('Fetch Data'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 3. Inside the _RealFlutterState, a string variable _data is initialized to hold fetched data.
// 4. The _fetchData function is defined to make a network request using DAPNetwork.
// 5. When the button is pressed, _fetchData is called, which fetches data from a sample API.
// 6. If the request is successful, the state is updated with the fetched title; otherwise, an error message is displayed.
// 7. The UI consists of a Text widget to show the data and a button to trigger the fetch operation.
```
