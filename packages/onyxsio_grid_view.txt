        pagination: true,

        pageSize: 5,

  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a grid view containing the data.
// 2. The user can scroll through the grid view to view more data.
// 3. When the user reaches the end of the page, the app will fetch more data and append it to the grid view.
// 4. The user can continue scrolling and the app will continue to fetch more data until there is no more data to fetch.
// 5. The app will display a loading indicator while fetching more data.
