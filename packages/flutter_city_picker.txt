# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_city_picker

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_city_picker` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_city_picker` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_city_picker: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install Packages

Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` file to allow network requests. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>

# Complete Example of flutter_city_picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_city_picker/flutter_city_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'City Picker Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: CityPickerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class CityPickerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CityPickerScreenState createState() => _CityPickerScreenState();
}

class _CityPickerScreenState extends State<CityPickerScreen> {
  String _selectedCity = "Select a city"; // Variable to hold the selected city

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('City Picker Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              _selectedCity, // Display the selected city
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () async {
                // Open the city picker when the button is pressed
                final result = await showCityPicker(
                  context: context,
                  // Optional: Customize the city picker
                  theme: CityPickerTheme(
                    backgroundColor: Colors.white,
                    primaryColor: Colors.blue,
                    accentColor: Colors.blueAccent,
                  ),
                );

                // Check if a city was selected
                if (result != null) {
                  setState(() {
                    _selectedCity = result; // Update the selected city
                  });
                }
              },
              child: Text('Pick a City'), // Button to trigger city picker
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application using the flutter_city_picker package.
// 
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The CityPickerScreen widget is the main screen where the city picker is implemented.
// 4. Inside the CityPickerScreen, a stateful widget is used to manage the selected city.
// 5. The _selectedCity variable holds the currently selected city, initialized to "Select a city".
// 6. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget containing:
//    - A Text widget to display the selected city.
//    - An ElevatedButton that, when pressed, opens the city picker.
// 7. The showCityPicker function is called when the button is pressed, allowing the user to select a city.
// 8. If a city is selected, the _selectedCity variable is updated, and the UI reflects the change.
// 
// This simple application effectively demonstrates how to integrate the flutter_city_picker package into a Flutter app.
