Here's a detailed technical blog on the "linear_progress_bar" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Linear Progress Bar Flutter Package

The `linear_progress_bar` Flutter package is a versatile and customizable widget that allows developers to easily implement linear progress indicators in their applications. This package is particularly useful for scenarios where you want to provide users with visual feedback on ongoing processes, such as loading data, file uploads, or any task that takes time to complete.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `linear_progress_bar` package in the following scenarios:

- **Loading Data**: When fetching data from an API or database, a progress bar can inform users that the application is working on their request.
- **File Uploads/Downloads**: During file transfers, a progress bar can indicate how much of the file has been uploaded or downloaded.
- **Long-running Tasks**: For tasks that take a noticeable amount of time, such as image processing or complex calculations, a progress bar can enhance user experience by providing feedback.

## Features

- **Customizable Appearance**: You can easily customize the color, height, and animation of the progress bar to match your app's theme.
- **Flexible Usage**: The package supports both determinate and indeterminate progress indicators, allowing you to represent known and unknown progress states.
- **Easy Integration**: The package is straightforward to integrate into any Flutter application with minimal setup.

Overall, the `linear_progress_bar` package is a powerful tool for enhancing user experience by providing clear visual feedback during time-consuming operations.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Linear Progress Bar Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `linear_progress_bar` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  linear_progress_bar: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/linear_progress_bar).

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your `ios/Podfile` has the platform set to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Linear Progress Bar

You can now use the `LinearProgressBar` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:linear_progress_bar/linear_progress_bar.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Linear Progress Bar Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: LinearProgressBar(
            min: 0,
            max: 100,
            current: 50, // Set the current progress
            backgroundColor: Colors.grey[300],
            progressColor: Colors.blue,
            height: 10,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple app with a linear progress bar that shows 50% progress. You can adjust the `current` value to reflect the actual progress of your task.

# Complete Example of Linear Progress Bar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:linear_progress_bar/linear_progress_bar.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  double _progress = 0; // Variable to hold the current progress

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _simulateProgress(); // Start simulating progress when the app initializes
  }

  // Function to simulate progress over time
  void _simulateProgress() async {
    while (_progress < 100) {
      await Future.delayed(Duration(milliseconds: 100)); // Wait for 100 milliseconds
      setState(() {
        _progress += 5; // Increment progress by 5%
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Linear Progress Bar Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Display the linear progress bar
              LinearProgressBar(
                min: 0,
                max: 100,
                current: _progress, // Bind the current progress to the variable
                backgroundColor: Colors.grey[300],
                progressColor: Colors.blue,
                height: 10,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Add some space between the progress bar and text
              Text('Progress: ${_progress.toStringAsFixed(0)}%'), // Display the current progress percentage
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation

// The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` widget.
// The `RealFlutter` widget is a stateful widget that maintains the current progress state.
// In the `initState` method, we call `_simulateProgress` to start updating the progress.
// The `_simulateProgress` function uses a while loop to increment the progress by 5% every 100 milliseconds until it reaches 100%.
// The `build` method returns a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing a LinearProgressBar and a Text widget.
// The LinearProgressBar displays the current progress, which is updated in real-time as the `_progress` variable changes.
// The Text widget shows the current progress percentage, providing users with clear feedback on the ongoing task.
