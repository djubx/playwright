# Setup and Usage Tutorial for flutter_shieldfraud

## Installation
To add the `flutter_shieldfraud` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_shieldfraud: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_shieldfraud).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located in `android/app/src/main/`.
2. Add the necessary permissions and configurations as specified in the package documentation. This may include internet permissions or specific service declarations.

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located in `ios/Runner/`.
2. Add any required configurations, such as permissions for network access or background modes.

## Basic Usage
To use the `flutter_shieldfraud` package, you need to initialize it in your main application file. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set it up:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_shieldfraud/flutter_shieldfraud.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Shield Fraud Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the fraud detection service
    FlutterShieldFraud.initialize();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Fraud Detection Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Fraud detection is active!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize the `flutter_shieldfraud` package in the `initState` method of our main widget. This ensures that the fraud detection service is ready to monitor user activities as soon as the app starts.

# Complete Example of flutter_shieldfraud

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_shieldfraud/flutter_shieldfraud.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Shield Fraud Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the fraud detection service
    FlutterShieldFraud.initialize();
  }

  // Method to simulate user activity
  void simulateUserActivity() {
    // Here you would implement logic to track user behavior
    // For example, tracking clicks, navigation, etc.
    FlutterShieldFraud.trackUserActivity();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Fraud Detection Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Fraud detection is active!'),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Simulate user activity when button is pressed
                simulateUserActivity();
              },
              child: Text('Simulate Activity'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with the title 'Flutter Shield Fraud Demo'.
// 3. The home of the app is set to RealFlutter, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 4. In the _RealFlutterState class, the initState method is overridden to initialize the fraud detection service.
// 5. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 6. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to display a message and a button.
// 7. When the button is pressed, the simulateUserActivity method is called, which would track user behavior.
// 8. The app is now ready to monitor user activities and detect any fraudulent behavior.
