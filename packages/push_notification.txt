<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Push Notification Flutter Package

The `push_notification` Flutter package is a powerful tool that allows developers to integrate push notifications into their Flutter applications seamlessly. Push notifications are essential for engaging users, providing timely updates, and enhancing the overall user experience. This package simplifies the process of setting up and managing push notifications across both Android and iOS platforms.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `push_notification` package in scenarios such as:
- **User Engagement**: To send updates, reminders, or promotional messages to users.
- **Real-time Notifications**: For applications that require real-time updates, such as messaging apps or social media platforms.
- **Event Alerts**: To notify users about events, deadlines, or changes in status.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Customizable Notifications**: Allows customization of notification appearance and behavior.
- **Background Notifications**: Supports notifications even when the app is in the background.
- **Rich Media Support**: Enables sending images, videos, and other media types with notifications.
- **User Interaction**: Handles user interactions with notifications, such as tapping to open specific screens.

With these features, the `push_notification` package is an excellent choice for developers looking to enhance their Flutter applications with push notifications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up Push Notifications in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `push_notification` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

First, add the `push_notification` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  push_notification: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Configure for Android

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions and services:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED"/>
<application>
    ...
    <service android:name="com.example.push_notification.PushNotificationService"/>
    <receiver android:name="com.example.push_notification.PushNotificationReceiver"/>
</application>
```

2. **Firebase Setup**: If you are using Firebase for push notifications, ensure you have added the `google-services.json` file to your `android/app` directory and included the necessary Firebase dependencies in your `build.gradle` files.

## Step 3: Configure for iOS

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>fetch</string>
    <string>remote-notification</string>
</array>
<key>FirebaseAppDelegateProxyEnabled</key>
<false/>
```

2. **Request Permissions**: Ensure you request permission to send notifications in your app. This can be done in your Dart code.

## Step 4: Initialize the Package

In your main Dart file, initialize the `push_notification` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:push_notification/push_notification.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Push Notification Demo',
      home: NotificationHome(),
    );
  }
}

class NotificationHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _NotificationHomeState createState() => _NotificationHomeState();
}

class _NotificationHomeState extends State<NotificationHome> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize push notifications
    PushNotification.initialize();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Push Notification Demo')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Welcome to Push Notification Demo')),
    );
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Sending Notifications

You can send notifications from your server using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or any other service. Ensure you handle incoming notifications in your app by implementing the necessary callbacks.

With these steps, you should have a basic setup for push notifications in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Push Notification in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:push_notification/push_notification.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// Main application widget
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Push Notification Demo',
      home: NotificationHome(),
    );
  }
}

// Home screen widget
class NotificationHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _NotificationHomeState createState() => _NotificationHomeState();
}

class _NotificationHomeState extends State<NotificationHome> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize push notifications
    PushNotification.initialize();
    // Set up notification listeners
    PushNotification.onMessage.listen((message) {
      // Handle incoming message
      print("Received message: $message");
      // Show a dialog or navigate to a specific screen
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Push Notification Demo')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Simulate sending a notification
            PushNotification.sendNotification(
              title: "Hello!",
              body: "This is a test notification.",
            );
          },
          child: Text('Send Test Notification'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application flow explanation:
// 1. The app starts and initializes the PushNotification package.
// 2. In the initState method, we set up a listener for incoming messages.
// 3. When a notification is received, it prints the message to the console.
// 4. The user can click the button to simulate sending a test notification.
// 5. The notification will be displayed based on the platform's notification settings.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the `push_notification` package. The application initializes the package, listens for incoming notifications, and allows the user to send a test notification. 

### Summary of Application Flow
- The application starts by initializing the `push_notification` package.
- It sets up a listener to handle incoming notifications.
- When a notification is received, it can be processed (e.g., displayed in a dialog).
- The user can send a test notification by clicking a button, which simulates the notification sending process.

This structure provides a comprehensive overview of the `push_notification` package, guiding users through setup and implementation while offering a complete example for practical understanding.
