# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_scan_bluetooth

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_scan_bluetooth` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_scan_bluetooth` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_scan_bluetooth: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_scan_bluetooth).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
```

3. If you are targeting Android 12 (API level 31) or higher, you also need to add:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_SCAN"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request permission for Bluetooth usage:

```xml
<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires Bluetooth access to connect to devices.</string>
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires location access to discover Bluetooth devices.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. Below is a complete example demonstrating how to scan for Bluetooth devices and connect to them.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_scan_bluetooth/flutter_scan_bluetooth.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // List to hold discovered devices
  List<BluetoothDevice> devices = [];
  // Instance of the Bluetooth scanner
  final FlutterScanBluetooth bluetoothScanner = FlutterScanBluetooth();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Start scanning for Bluetooth devices
    startScan();
  }

  // Function to start scanning for Bluetooth devices
  void startScan() async {
    // Clear the previous list of devices
    devices.clear();
    // Start scanning
    bluetoothScanner.startScan().listen((device) {
      // Add discovered devices to the list
      setState(() {
        devices.add(device);
      });
    });
  }

  // Function to stop scanning
  void stopScan() {
    bluetoothScanner.stopScan();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Stop scanning when the widget is disposed
    stopScan();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Bluetooth Scanner'),
        ),
        body: Column(
          children: [
            Expanded(
              child: ListView.builder(
                itemCount: devices.length,
                itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                  return ListTile(
                    title: Text(devices[index].name ?? 'Unknown Device'),
                    subtitle: Text(devices[index].address),
                    onTap: () {
                      // Handle device connection here
                      connectToDevice(devices[index]);
                    },
                  );
                },
              ),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: startScan,
              child: Text('Scan Again'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to connect to a selected Bluetooth device
  void connectToDevice(BluetoothDevice device) {
    // Implement connection logic here
    print('Connecting to ${device.name}');
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and initializes the Bluetooth scanner.
// 2. It begins scanning for nearby Bluetooth devices in the initState method.
// 3. Discovered devices are added to the devices list and displayed in a ListView.
// 4. When a device is tapped, the connectToDevice function is called, where you can implement the connection logic.
// 5. The user can also press the "Scan Again" button to refresh the list of discovered devices.
```
<!-- END_MAIN -->

### Summary of Application Flow

The application starts by initializing the Bluetooth scanner and begins scanning for nearby devices. Discovered devices are displayed in a list, and users can tap on a device to initiate a connection. The "Scan Again" button allows users to refresh the list of devices. The code is structured to handle Bluetooth scanning and connection management effectively, providing a solid foundation for any Bluetooth-enabled Flutter application.
