# Tutorial: Setting Up the Analog Clock Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To use the **analog_clock** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  analog_clock: ^0.0.6  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install the Package
Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Import the Package
In your Dart file where you want to use the analog clock, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:analog_clock/analog_clock.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Analog Clock Widget
You can now use the `AnalogClock` widget in your widget tree. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
AnalogClock(
  showSecondHand: true,
  showNumbers: true,
  numberColor: Colors.black,
  showTicks: true,
  tickColor: Colors.black,
  size: 200.0,
  decoration: BoxDecoration(
    color: Colors.white,
    shape: BoxShape.circle,
    boxShadow: [
      BoxShadow(
        color: Colors.black12,
        blurRadius: 10.0,
        spreadRadius: 2.0,
      ),
    ],
  ),
)
```

This code snippet creates a simple analog clock with second hand, numbers, and ticks.

# Complete Example of Using the Analog Clock Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:analog_clock/analog_clock.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Analog Clock Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Analog Clock'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: AnalogClock(
            showSecondHand: true, // Show the second hand
            showNumbers: true, // Display numbers on the clock
            numberColor: Colors.black, // Color of the numbers
            showTicks: true, // Show ticks on the clock
            tickColor: Colors.black, // Color of the ticks
            size: 200.0, // Size of the clock
            decoration: BoxDecoration(
              color: Colors.white, // Background color of the clock
              shape: BoxShape.circle, // Shape of the clock
              boxShadow: [
                BoxShadow(
                  color: Colors.black12, // Shadow color
                  blurRadius: 10.0, // Blur radius of the shadow
                  spreadRadius: 2.0, // Spread radius of the shadow
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with MyApp as the root widget.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Analog Clock'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers the AnalogClock widget.
// 5. The AnalogClock widget is configured to show the second hand, numbers, and ticks, with specified colors and size.
// 6. The decoration property adds a circular shape with a white background and a shadow effect to the clock.
