<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Visibility Detector Flutter Package

The **visibility_detector** package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that allows you to detect the visibility of widgets on the screen. This can be particularly useful for optimizing performance, tracking user engagement, or triggering animations when a widget comes into view. 

## When to Use This Package
You might want to use the **visibility_detector** package in scenarios such as:
- **Analytics Tracking**: To track how often a user sees certain elements on the screen.
- **Lazy Loading**: To load images or data only when they are visible to the user, improving performance and reducing memory usage.
- **Animations**: To trigger animations when a widget becomes visible, enhancing user experience.

## Features
- **Visibility Detection**: Easily determine if a widget is visible on the screen.
- **Callbacks**: Execute functions when the visibility changes, allowing for dynamic UI updates.
- **Customizable**: Works with any widget, making it versatile for various use cases.

Overall, the **visibility_detector** package is an essential tool for any Flutter developer looking to enhance their applications' performance and user engagement.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Visibility Detector

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the **visibility_detector** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  visibility_detector: ^0.2.2  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:visibility_detector/visibility_detector.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using VisibilityDetector
Wrap the widget you want to track with the `VisibilityDetector` widget. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

```dart
VisibilityDetector(
  key: Key('my-widget-key'),
  onVisibilityChanged: (VisibilityInfo info) {
    // This callback is triggered when the visibility changes
    print('Widget is ${info.visibleFraction * 100}% visible');
  },
  child: YourWidget(),
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details
- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21.
- **iOS**: No specific configurations are required, but ensure your deployment target is compatible.

### Optimizations
- Use keys for your `VisibilityDetector` to ensure that the visibility state is tracked correctly across widget rebuilds.
- Consider using the `visibleFraction` property to determine how much of the widget is visible and adjust your logic accordingly.

With these steps, you can effectively set up and use the **visibility_detector** package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Visibility Detector

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:visibility_detector/visibility_detector.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Visibility Detector Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Visibility Detector Example'),
        ),
        body: VisibilityExample(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class VisibilityExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ListView.builder(
      itemCount: 20,
      itemBuilder: (context, index) {
        return VisibilityDetector(
          key: Key('widget-$index'),
          onVisibilityChanged: (VisibilityInfo info) {
            // Log the visibility percentage of the widget
            print('Widget $index is ${info.visibleFraction * 100}% visible');
          },
          child: Container(
            height: 100,
            margin: EdgeInsets.all(10),
            color: Colors.blue[(index % 9 + 1) * 100],
            child: Center(
              child: Text(
                'Item $index',
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets up the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold containing an AppBar and the VisibilityExample widget.
// 3. VisibilityExample uses a ListView.builder to create a list of 20 items.
// 4. Each item is wrapped in a VisibilityDetector, which tracks its visibility on the screen.
// 5. When the visibility of an item changes, the onVisibilityChanged callback is triggered, logging the visibility percentage to the console.
// 6. The Container for each item has a unique color and displays its index, making it easy to see which items are visible as you scroll.
