In summary, this code creates a Flutter application that demonstrates the usage of the `flutter_animated_progress` package. The application displays an `AnimatedProgressIndicator` with a progress value of 0, and two buttons to animate the progress value to 1 and reset it to 0. The application flow is as described in the comments above.
