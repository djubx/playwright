# Setup and Usage Tutorial for flutter_animated_progress

## Installation
To get started with the `flutter_animated_progress` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_animated_progress: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No specific configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `flutter_animated_progress` package, you can create a simple widget that utilizes the `AnimatedProgress` class. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_animated_progress/flutter_animated_progress.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Animated Progress Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: AnimatedProgress(
          progress: 0.7, // Set progress value between 0.0 and 1.0
          color: Colors.blue,
          width: 200,
          height: 20,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple `Scaffold` with an `AppBar` and a centered `AnimatedProgress` widget that shows 70% progress.

Now you are ready to implement animated progress indicators in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of flutter_animated_progress

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_animated_progress/flutter_animated_progress.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Animated Progress Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  double _progress = 0.0; // Initialize progress to 0.0

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _simulateProgress(); // Start simulating progress on init
  }

  // Simulate progress over time
  void _simulateProgress() async {
    while (_progress < 1.0) {
      await Future.delayed(Duration(milliseconds: 100)); // Delay for 100ms
      setState(() {
        _progress += 0.1; // Increment progress by 10%
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Animated Progress Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Animated progress indicator
            AnimatedProgress(
              progress: _progress, // Bind progress to the state variable
              color: Colors.blue,
              width: 200,
              height: 20,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Add space between widgets
            Text('${(_progress * 100).toStringAsFixed(0)}%'), // Display progress percentage
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that manages its own state.
// 4. In the initState method, we call _simulateProgress to start updating the progress.
// 5. _simulateProgress uses a while loop to increment the progress by 10% every 100 milliseconds.
// 6. The AnimatedProgress widget displays the current progress, which updates as the state changes.
// 7. A Text widget below the progress indicator shows the current percentage of progress.
