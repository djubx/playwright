# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the InteractiveViewer_Gallery Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `interactiveviewer_gallery` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  interactiveviewer_gallery: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # Ensure this is set to at least 10.0
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement an interactive image gallery.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
# Complete Example of Using InteractiveViewer_Gallery

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:interactiveviewer_gallery/interactiveviewer_gallery.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Interactive Viewer Gallery',
      home: GalleryScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class GalleryScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  // List of image URLs to display in the gallery
  final List<String> imageUrls = [
    'https://example.com/image1.jpg',
    'https://example.com/image2.jpg',
    'https://example.com/image3.jpg',
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Interactive Image Gallery'),
      ),
      body: InteractiveViewerGallery(
        // Pass the list of images to the gallery
        images: imageUrls.map((url) => NetworkImage(url)).toList(),
        // Optional: Set the initial scale
        minScale: 0.5,
        maxScale: 4.0,
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The GalleryScreen widget is displayed as the home screen, which contains an AppBar and the InteractiveViewerGallery.
// 4. The InteractiveViewerGallery takes a list of image URLs, converts them to NetworkImage objects, and displays them.
// 5. Users can interact with the images by zooming and panning, providing an engaging experience.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application that displays an interactive image gallery. The `GalleryScreen` widget contains a list of image URLs, which are passed to the `InteractiveViewerGallery`. Users can zoom in and out and pan around the images, making it a user-friendly experience.

### Summary of Application Flow

- The application starts with the `main()` function, which initializes the `RealFlutter` widget.
- The `RealFlutter` widget sets up a `MaterialApp` with a title and a home screen.
- The `GalleryScreen` widget is responsible for displaying the interactive gallery.
- The `InteractiveViewerGallery` widget takes a list of images and allows users to interact with them through zooming and panning.

This structure provides a clear and engaging way to present images in your Flutter applications, enhancing user experience significantly.
