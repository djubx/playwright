# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_html_all

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with `flutter_html_all`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_html_all: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable the `NSAppTransportSecurity` settings in your `Info.plist` file if you are loading content from the web:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to render HTML content.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_html_all/flutter_html_all.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample HTML content
    String htmlData = """
      <h1>Hello, Flutter!</h1>
      <p>This is a <strong>simple</strong> example of rendering HTML.</p>
      <a href='https://flutter.dev'>Visit Flutter</a>
    """;

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('flutter_html_all Example'),
      ),
      body: SingleChildScrollView(
        child: HtmlAll(
          data: htmlData,
          // Optional: Customize styles
          style: {
            "h1": Style(color: Colors.blue),
            "p": Style(fontSize: FontSize.large),
          },
          // Handle link taps
          onLinkTap: (url) {
            // Handle link tap
            print("Opening $url");
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that renders HTML content using the `HtmlAll` widget. The `data` parameter takes the HTML string, and you can customize styles for specific HTML tags.

# Complete Example of flutter_html_all

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_html_all/flutter_html_all.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample HTML content
    String htmlData = """
      <h1>Hello, Flutter!</h1>
      <p>This is a <strong>simple</strong> example of rendering HTML.</p>
      <a href='https://flutter.dev'>Visit Flutter</a>
    """;

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('flutter_html_all Example'),
        ),
        body: SingleChildScrollView(
          child: HtmlAll(
            data: htmlData,
            // Optional: Customize styles
            style: {
              "h1": Style(color: Colors.blue), // Set color for h1
              "p": Style(fontSize: FontSize.large), // Set font size for paragraphs
            },
            // Handle link taps
            onLinkTap: (url) {
              // Print the URL to the console
              print("Opening $url");
              // You can also use url_launcher to open the link
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a body that uses SingleChildScrollView to allow scrolling.
// 4. Inside the body, the HtmlAll widget is used to render the HTML content.
// 5. The HTML content includes a heading, a paragraph, and a link.
// 6. The style parameter customizes the appearance of the HTML elements.
// 7. The onLinkTap callback handles link clicks, allowing you to define what happens when a link is tapped.
```
