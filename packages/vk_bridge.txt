In summary, this code demonstrates how to use the `vk_bridge` package to integrate VK login and sharing functionality into a Flutter app. The app initializes `vk_bridge` with the VK app ID, logs in to VK using `VKBridge.login()`, and shares content to VK using `VKBridge.share()`. The app also receives the VK token and share result, which can be used to access VK's API and handle share errors.
