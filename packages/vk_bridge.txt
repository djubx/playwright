# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `vk_bridge`

## Installation
To get started with the `vk_bridge` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  vk_bridge: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/vk_bridge).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the following to your `AndroidManifest.xml` to allow internet access:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. Ensure you have the correct URL schemes set up for VK authentication.

## Using the Package
To use the `vk_bridge` package, you need to initialize it and handle user authentication. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to do this:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:vk_bridge/vk_bridge.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('VK Bridge Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initialize VK Bridge
              final vkBridge = VkBridge(appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID');

              // Authenticate user
              final user = await vkBridge.login();
              if (user != null) {
                // User is logged in, you can access user data
                print('User logged in: ${user.name}');
              } else {
                print('Login failed');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Login with VK'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, replace `YOUR_APP_ID` with your actual VK application ID. The `login` method handles the authentication process and returns user data upon successful login.

# Complete Example of `vk_bridge`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:vk_bridge/vk_bridge.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('VK Bridge Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initialize VK Bridge with your app ID
              final vkBridge = VkBridge(appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID');

              // Attempt to log in the user
              final user = await vkBridge.login();
              if (user != null) {
                // If login is successful, print user information
                print('User logged in: ${user.name}');
              } else {
                // If login fails, print an error message
                print('Login failed');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Login with VK'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which builds a MaterialApp.
// 2. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. The Center widget contains an ElevatedButton that triggers the VK login process when pressed.
// 4. Upon pressing the button, an instance of VkBridge is created with the specified app ID.
// 5. The login method is called, which handles the authentication process.
// 6. If the user successfully logs in, their name is printed to the console; otherwise, a login failure message is displayed.
