import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_arc_speed_dial/flutter_arc_speed_dial.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Arc Speed Dial Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Arc Speed Dial Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Press the speed dial button!'),
        ),
        // Adding the ArcSpeedDial widget to the floating action button area
        floatingActionButton: ArcSpeedDial(
          // The main button that opens the speed dial
          mainButton: FloatingActionButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Action when the main button is pressed
              print('Main button pressed');
            },
            child: Icon(Icons.add),
          ),
          // List of speed dial buttons
          children: [
            // First speed dial button
            ArcSpeedDialChild(
              child: Icon(Icons.share),
              label: Text('Share'),
              onTap: () {
                // Action when the share button is pressed
                print('Share button pressed');
              },
            ),
            // Second speed dial button
            ArcSpeedDialChild(
              child: Icon(Icons.favorite),
              label: Text('Favorite'),
              onTap: () {
                // Action when the favorite button is pressed
                print('Favorite button pressed');
              },
            ),
            // Third speed dial button
            ArcSpeedDialChild(
              child: Icon(Icons.settings),
              label: Text('Settings'),
              onTap: () {
                // Action when the settings button is pressed
                print('Settings button pressed');
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter class builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget displaying a message.
// 4. The ArcSpeedDial widget is added as a floating action button.
// 5. The main button (a FloatingActionButton) triggers an action when pressed.
// 6. The speed dial contains three buttons (Share, Favorite, Settings) with their respective actions.
// 7. Each button prints a message to the console when pressed, demonstrating the functionality of the speed dial.
