# Description

The `ellipsized_text` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to handle text overflow elegantly in Flutter applications. It provides a way to display long text strings while ensuring that they fit within a specified space, using ellipses to indicate that the text has been truncated. This is particularly useful in user interfaces where space is limited, such as in list items, cards, or any other widget that requires concise text representation.

## When to Use

You should consider using the `ellipsized_text` package in scenarios such as:
- Displaying long titles or descriptions in a card layout.
- Creating list views where items may have varying text lengths.
- Ensuring a clean and professional UI by managing text overflow without compromising readability.

## Features

- **Customizable Ellipsis**: You can customize the ellipsis character or string.
- **Multiple Text Styles**: Supports different text styles for the main text and the ellipsis.
- **Flexible Layout**: Automatically adjusts to the available space, making it responsive.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate into existing Flutter projects with minimal setup.

Overall, the `ellipsized_text` package enhances the user experience by providing a clean way to handle text overflow, making it a valuable addition to any Flutter developer's toolkit.

     }
     ```

   - **iOS**: No specific configurations are required for iOS, but ensure your deployment target is set appropriately in `ios/Podfile`.

## Using the Package

To use the `ellipsized_text` package, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:ellipsized_text/ellipsized_text.dart';
```

### Basic Usage Example

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use `EllipsizedText` in your Flutter application:

```dart
EllipsizedText(
  'This is a very long text that will be truncated with an ellipsis if it does not fit within the available space.',
  maxLines: 2, // Specify the maximum number of lines
  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16, color: Colors.black), // Text style
  ellipsis: '...', // Custom ellipsis
)
```

This will display the text, truncating it with an ellipsis if it exceeds two lines.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ellipsized_text/ellipsized_text.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Ellipsized Text Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Ellipsized Text Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
            child: Column(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              children: [
                // Using EllipsizedText to display long text
                EllipsizedText(
                  'This is a very long text that will be truncated with an ellipsis if it does not fit within the available space.',
                  maxLines: 2, // Limit to 2 lines
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16, color: Colors.black), // Text style
                  ellipsis: '...', // Custom ellipsis
                ),
                SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between texts
                EllipsizedText(
                  'Another example of a long text that might not fit in the designated area, showcasing the ellipsized text feature.',
                  maxLines: 3, // Limit to 3 lines
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16, color: Colors.blue), // Different text style
                  ellipsis: ' [Read more]', // Custom ellipsis
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Ellipsized Text Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a column with two EllipsizedText widgets.
// 5. Each EllipsizedText widget displays a long string of text, which will be truncated if it exceeds the specified number of lines.
// 6. The first EllipsizedText is limited to 2 lines, while the second is limited to 3 lines, demonstrating the flexibility of the package.
// 7. The text styles and custom ellipses are applied to show how to customize the appearance of the text.
```
