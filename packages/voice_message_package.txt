# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Voice Message Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `voice_message_package` to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  voice_message_package: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request microphone access:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone to record voice messages.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save recordings.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that the package is set up, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to record and play back voice messages.

# Complete Example of Using the Voice Message Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:voice_message_package/voice_message_package.dart'; // Import the package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the main application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late VoiceMessageController _controller; // Controller for managing voice messages
  String _recordedFilePath = ''; // Path to the recorded file

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _controller = VoiceMessageController(); // Initialize the controller
  }

  // Function to start recording
  void _startRecording() async {
    _recordedFilePath = await _controller.startRecording(); // Start recording and get file path
    setState(() {}); // Update UI
  }

  // Function to stop recording
  void _stopRecording() async {
    await _controller.stopRecording(); // Stop recording
    setState(() {}); // Update UI
  }

  // Function to play the recorded message
  void _playRecording() {
    _controller.playRecording(_recordedFilePath); // Play the recorded file
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Voice Message Example')), // App bar title
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _startRecording, // Start recording on button press
                child: Text('Start Recording'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _stopRecording, // Stop recording on button press
                child: Text('Stop Recording'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _playRecording, // Play recording on button press
                child: Text('Play Recording'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and initializes the VoiceMessageController.
// 2. When the user presses "Start Recording", the app begins recording audio and stores the file path.
// 3. Pressing "Stop Recording" stops the recording process.
// 4. The user can then press "Play Recording" to listen to the recorded audio.
// 5. The UI updates accordingly to reflect the current state of the recording process.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application that allows users to record and play back voice messages. The application flow is straightforward:
- The user can start and stop recording audio messages.
- After recording, they can play back the audio.
- The UI is updated based on the actions taken by the user.

This example demonstrates the core functionalities of the `voice_message_package`, showcasing how easy it is to integrate voice messaging features into your Flutter applications.
