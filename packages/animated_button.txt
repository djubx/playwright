# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Animated Button Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the **animated_button** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  animated_button: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:animated_button/animated_button.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Animated Button
You can now use the `AnimatedButton` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
AnimatedButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // Action to perform on button press
  },
  child: Text('Click Me'),
  duration: 200, // Duration of the animation
  color: Colors.blue, // Button color
  // Additional properties can be set here
);
```

This button will animate when pressed, providing a smooth transition that enhances the user experience.

# Complete Example of Using the Animated Button Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_button/animated_button.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animated Button Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Animated Button Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: AnimatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Action to perform on button press
              ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                SnackBar(content: Text('Button Pressed!')),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Click Me'),
            duration: 200, // Duration of the animation
            color: Colors.blue, // Button color
            // Additional properties can be set here
            width: 200, // Width of the button
            height: 50, // Height of the button
            // You can customize the button further with more properties
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Animated Button Demo'.
// 4. In the body of the Scaffold, a Center widget is used to center the AnimatedButton.
// 5. The AnimatedButton is configured with an onPressed callback that shows a SnackBar when pressed.
// 6. The button has a blue color, a width of 200, and a height of 50, with a 200ms animation duration.
// 7. When the button is pressed, the animation occurs, and the SnackBar appears, providing feedback to the user.
