# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the "info_widget" Package

## Installation
To get started with the `info_widget` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  info_widget: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/info_widget).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package
Once you have installed the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement an info widget.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:info_widget/info_widget.dart';
```

2. Create an info widget and attach it to a target widget:

```dart
InfoWidget(
  title: 'Info Title',
  description: 'This is a description of the info widget.',
  child: Icon(Icons.info),
);
```

This will create an info widget that appears when the user interacts with the icon.

# Complete Example of Using the "info_widget" Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:info_widget/info_widget.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Info Widget Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Info Widget Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: InfoWidget(
            title: 'Info Title', // Title of the info widget
            description: 'This is a description of the info widget.', // Description text
            child: Icon(Icons.info, size: 50), // The target widget
            // You can customize the position and style of the info widget
            infoWidgetStyle: InfoWidgetStyle(
              backgroundColor: Colors.blueAccent, // Background color of the info widget
              textColor: Colors.white, // Text color
              borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(8), // Rounded corners
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'Info Widget Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 5. The InfoWidget is created with a title and description, which will be displayed when the user interacts with the icon.
// 6. The child of the InfoWidget is an Icon widget, which serves as the target for the info overlay.
// 7. The InfoWidgetStyle allows customization of the appearance of the info widget, including background color, text color, and border radius.
// 8. When the user taps on the icon, the info widget will appear, providing additional context to the user.
