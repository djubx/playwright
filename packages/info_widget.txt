The code flow is as follows:

* The `RealFlutter` class is a stateful widget that creates a `Scaffold` to hold the `InfoWidget`.
* The `InfoWidget` is created with a title, content, and icon, and is displayed in the center of the screen.
* The user can interact with the `InfoWidget` by tapping on it or scrolling through its content.
* The `InfoWidget` displays the title, content, and icon in a visually appealing way, using the Material Design style on Android and the Cupertino style on iOS.
