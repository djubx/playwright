# Turkish Flutter Package

The **Turkish** Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to facilitate the localization of Flutter applications for Turkish-speaking users. It provides a comprehensive set of features that allow developers to easily integrate Turkish language support into their apps, ensuring a seamless user experience for Turkish speakers.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the Turkish package when:
- You are developing a Flutter application that targets Turkish-speaking audiences.
- You want to provide a localized experience without manually managing translations.
- You need to handle Turkish-specific formatting, such as date and number formats.

## Features

- **Localization Support**: Automatically translates strings into Turkish.
- **Date and Number Formatting**: Provides Turkish-specific formats for dates and numbers.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup process that integrates smoothly with existing Flutter applications.
- **Customizable**: Allows developers to add custom translations and formats as needed.

By leveraging the Turkish package, developers can enhance their applications' accessibility and usability for Turkish-speaking users, making it an essential tool for internationalization in Flutter.

# Tutorial: Setting Up the Turkish Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the Turkish package in a Flutter application. We will cover platform-specific details for both Android and iOS.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the Turkish package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  turkish: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Configuring for Android

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file includes the necessary configurations. You may need to set the minimum SDK version to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Configuring for iOS

For iOS, you need to ensure that your `Info.plist` file includes the necessary localization settings. Add the following lines to support Turkish:

```xml
<key>CFBundleLocalizations</key>
<array>
    <string>tr</string>
</array>
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. Import the package in your Dart files:

```dart
import 'package:turkish/turkish.dart';
```

You can now use the localization features provided by the package. For example, you can translate strings and format dates and numbers according to Turkish conventions.

# Complete Example of Using the Turkish Package

Below is a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the Turkish package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:turkish/turkish.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Turkish Localization Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
      // Setting the locale to Turkish
      locale: Locale('tr', ''),
      localizationsDelegates: [
        // Adding the Turkish localization delegate
        TurkishLocalizations.delegate,
        GlobalMaterialLocalizations.delegate,
        GlobalWidgetsLocalizations.delegate,
      ],
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text(TurkishLocalizations.of(context).translate('app_title')),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              TurkishLocalizations.of(context).translate('welcome_message'),
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(
              // Formatting a date in Turkish format
              TurkishDateFormat.yMMMMd().format(DateTime.now()),
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(
              // Formatting a number in Turkish format
              TurkishNumberFormat.currency(123456.78),
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with Turkish localization settings.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is displayed as the home screen of the app.
// 4. The AppBar displays the app title, which is translated into Turkish.
// 5. The body of the HomeScreen contains a welcome message, formatted date, and formatted number.
// 6. The TurkishLocalizations class is used to translate strings and format data according to Turkish conventions.
```
