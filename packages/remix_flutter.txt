# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Remix Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **remix_flutter** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **remix_flutter** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  remix_flutter: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    compileSdkVersion 31  // Ensure you are using the latest SDK version
    ...
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '12.0'  # Ensure you are using a compatible iOS version
```

After making these changes, run the following command to install the necessary pods:

```bash
cd ios
pod install
```

## Step 3: Using the Remix Flutter Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to create a basic app using the **remix_flutter** package.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:remix_flutter/remix_flutter.dart'; // Import the remix_flutter package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Remix Flutter Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue, // Set the primary color for the app
      ),
      home: HomePage(), // Set the home page of the app
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Remix Flutter Home'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            RemixButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action when the button is pressed
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Button Pressed!')),
                );
              },
              child: Text('Press Me'), // Button text
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between widgets
            RemixCard(
              child: Padding(
                padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
                child: Text('This is a card using Remix Flutter!'), // Card content
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The main function initializes the app and runs the RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// The HomePage widget is defined as the main screen of the app.
// Inside the HomePage, we have a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// The Center widget contains a Column that centers its children vertically.
// The first child is a RemixButton that shows a SnackBar when pressed.
// The second child is a RemixCard that displays some text.
// This structure allows for easy customization and expansion of the app.
