# Tutorial: Setting Up the Email OTP Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `email_otp` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `email_otp` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  email_otp: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Configure Android

For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file. Add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

## Step 3: Configure iOS

For iOS, you need to enable the appropriate capabilities. Open your `Info.plist` file and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:email_otp/email_otp.dart';
```

## Step 5: Initialize the Package

You can now initialize the `EmailOTP` class in your application. Hereâ€™s how to set it up:

```dart
EmailOTP emailOTP = EmailOTP();
```

## Step 6: Sending OTP

To send an OTP, use the following method:

```dart
emailOTP.sendOTP(recipientEmail: "user@example.com");
```

## Step 7: Verifying OTP

To verify the OTP entered by the user, use:

```dart
bool isVerified = emailOTP.verifyOTP(otp: "123456");
```

This will return `true` if the OTP is correct, and `false` otherwise.

With these steps, you can successfully set up and use the `email_otp` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Email OTP Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:email_otp/email_otp.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Email OTP Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: OTPVerificationScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class OTPVerificationScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _OTPVerificationScreenState createState() => _OTPVerificationScreenState();
}

class _OTPVerificationScreenState extends State<OTPVerificationScreen> {
  final EmailOTP emailOTP = EmailOTP();
  final TextEditingController emailController = TextEditingController();
  final TextEditingController otpController = TextEditingController();
  String message = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the EmailOTP package with your email service configuration
    emailOTP.setConfig(
      appEmail: "your_email@example.com", // Your email address
      appName: "Your App Name", // Your app name
      userEmail: "", // User's email will be set when sending OTP
    );
  }

  void sendOTP() async {
    // Get the email from the text field
    String email = emailController.text;

    // Send OTP to the provided email
    bool sent = await emailOTP.sendOTP(recipientEmail: email);
    if (sent) {
      setState(() {
        message = 'OTP sent to $email';
      });
    } else {
      setState(() {
        message = 'Failed to send OTP';
      });
    }
  }

  void verifyOTP() {
    // Get the OTP entered by the user
    String otp = otpController.text;

    // Verify the OTP
    bool isVerified = emailOTP.verifyOTP(otp: otp);
    if (isVerified) {
      setState(() {
        message = 'OTP verified successfully!';
      });
    } else {
      setState(() {
        message = 'Invalid OTP. Please try again.';
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Email OTP Verification'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              controller: emailController,
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter your email'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: sendOTP,
              child: Text('Send OTP'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            TextField(
              controller: otpController,
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter OTP'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: verifyOTP,
              child: Text('Verify OTP'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(message),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The OTPVerificationScreen is displayed, where users can enter their email and request an OTP.
// 3. When the user clicks 'Send OTP', the sendOTP method is called, which sends an OTP to the provided email.
// 4. The user then enters the OTP received in their email and clicks 'Verify OTP'.
// 5. The verifyOTP method checks if the entered OTP is correct and updates the message accordingly.
```
