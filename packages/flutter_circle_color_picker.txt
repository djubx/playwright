# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_circle_color_picker

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_circle_color_picker` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the `flutter_circle_color_picker` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_circle_color_picker: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that the package is set up, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `flutter_circle_color_picker` in your app.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_circle_color_picker/flutter_circle_color_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Circle Color Picker Demo',
      home: ColorPickerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ColorPickerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ColorPickerScreenState createState() => _ColorPickerScreenState();
}

class _ColorPickerScreenState extends State<ColorPickerScreen> {
  // Variable to hold the selected color
  Color selectedColor = Colors.blue;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Circle Color Picker'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the selected color
            Container(
              width: 100,
              height: 100,
              color: selectedColor,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Circle color picker widget
            CircleColorPicker(
              initialColor: selectedColor,
              onChanged: (Color color) {
                // Update the selected color when the user picks a new color
                setState(() {
                  selectedColor = color;
                });
              },
              // Optional: Customize the size of the color picker
              size: 200,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. The home of the app is ColorPickerScreen, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 4. In ColorPickerScreen, we maintain the selected color in a state variable.
// 5. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 6. Inside the Center widget, we display a container showing the selected color.
// 7. Below the container, we add the CircleColorPicker widget.
// 8. When the user selects a new color, the onChanged callback updates the selected color and rebuilds the UI to reflect the change.
```
