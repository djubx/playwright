# Setting Up and Using the Flutter Story Editor Package

## Installation
To get started with the `flutter_story_editor` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_story_editor: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_story_editor).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file, especially if you are using media content. Add the following keys:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to upload stories.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to capture stories.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
Once the package is installed and configured, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the `flutter_story_editor` in your app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_story_editor/flutter_story_editor.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Story Editor Example')),
        body: StoryEditor(
          stories: [
            StoryItem(
              media: StoryMedia.image('https://example.com/image1.jpg'),
              duration: Duration(seconds: 5),
            ),
            StoryItem(
              media: StoryMedia.video('https://example.com/video1.mp4'),
              duration: Duration(seconds: 10),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays a story editor with two story items: one image and one video. The `StoryEditor` widget takes a list of `StoryItem` objects, each containing media and duration.

# Complete Example of Flutter Story Editor

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_story_editor/flutter_story_editor.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Story Editor Example')),
        body: StoryEditor(
          stories: [
            // First story item: an image
            StoryItem(
              media: StoryMedia.image('https://example.com/image1.jpg'),
              duration: Duration(seconds: 5), // Display for 5 seconds
            ),
            // Second story item: a video
            StoryItem(
              media: StoryMedia.video('https://example.com/video1.mp4'),
              duration: Duration(seconds: 10), // Display for 10 seconds
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the `RealFlutter` class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. Inside the `build` method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// 3. The AppBar displays the title "Story Editor Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains the `StoryEditor` widget.
// 5. The `StoryEditor` takes a list of `StoryItem` objects.
// 6. Each `StoryItem` can contain different media types (image or video) and a duration for how long it should be displayed.
// 7. The first story item is an image that will be displayed for 5 seconds.
// 8. The second story item is a video that will be displayed for 10 seconds.
// 9. Users can swipe through the stories, and the interface will handle the transitions automatically.
