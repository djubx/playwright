        // Your stone_payments API secret
        apiSecret: 'YOUR_API_SECRET',
        // The payment method to use
        paymentMethod: PaymentMethod.creditCard,
        // The payment amount
        amount: 10.99,
        // The payment currency
        currency: 'USD',
        // The payment description
        description: 'Test payment',
        // The payment callback
        onPaymentSuccess: (paymentId) {
          print('Payment successful: $paymentId');
        },
        onPaymentError: (error) {
          print('Payment error: $error');
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user opens the app and is presented with a payment screen.
// 2. The user enters their payment information and submits the payment.
// 3. The stone_payments package processes the payment and returns a payment ID if successful.
// 4. The app displays a success message to the user with the payment ID.
// 5. If an error occurs during payment processing, the app displays an error message to the user.

// In summary, this code sets up a basic payment screen using the stone_payments package.
// It handles payment processing and displays a success or error message to the user.
