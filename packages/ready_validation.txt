# Overview of the `ready_validation` Flutter Package

The `ready_validation` package is a powerful tool designed to simplify form validation in Flutter applications. It provides a straightforward way to validate user input, ensuring that data entered into forms meets specific criteria before submission. This package is particularly useful in applications that require user registration, login forms, or any scenario where data integrity is crucial.

## When to Use `ready_validation`

You should consider using `ready_validation` when:
- You need to validate user input in forms.
- You want to provide real-time feedback to users as they fill out forms.
- You are looking for a package that simplifies the validation process without extensive boilerplate code.

## Key Features
- **Custom Validation Rules**: Easily define your own validation rules.
- **Real-time Validation**: Validate input as the user types, providing immediate feedback.
- **Error Messages**: Display custom error messages for each validation rule.
- **Integration with Flutter Forms**: Seamlessly integrates with Flutter's form widgets.

Overall, `ready_validation` enhances user experience by ensuring that forms are filled out correctly before submission, reducing errors and improving data quality.

# Setting Up and Using `ready_validation`

## Installation

To add the `ready_validation` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ready_validation: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your validation involves accessing device features (like camera or location).

## Basic Usage

To use `ready_validation`, you will typically create a form and apply validation rules to your input fields. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set it up:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:ready_validation/ready_validation.dart';
```

2. Create a form with validation:

```dart
class MyForm extends StatelessWidget {
  final _formKey = GlobalKey<FormState>();
  final _validator = Validator();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Form(
      key: _formKey,
      child: Column(
        children: [
          TextFormField(
            validator: _validator.required('This field is required'),
          ),
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              if (_formKey.currentState!.validate()) {
                // Process data
              }
            },
            child: Text('Submit'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to set up a basic form with a required field validation. The `Validator` class from `ready_validation` is used to define the validation rules.

# Complete Example of `ready_validation`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ready_validation/ready_validation.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Ready Validation Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Form Validation Example'),
        ),
        body: MyForm(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MyForm extends StatelessWidget {
  final _formKey = GlobalKey<FormState>(); // Key to identify the form
  final _validator = Validator(); // Instance of Validator for validation rules

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0), // Padding around the form
      child: Form(
        key: _formKey, // Assigning the form key
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextFormField(
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter your name'), // Label for the input
              validator: _validator.required('This field is required'), // Required field validation
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between fields
            TextFormField(
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter your email'), // Label for the input
              validator: _validator.email('Enter a valid email'), // Email format validation
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between fields
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                if (_formKey.currentState!.validate()) { // Validate the form
                  // If the form is valid, display a success message
                  ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                    SnackBar(content: Text('Processing Data')),
                  );
                }
              },
              child: Text('Submit'), // Button to submit the form
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and the MyForm widget.
// 4. MyForm creates a form with two TextFormFields for name and email.
// 5. Each TextFormField has a validator that checks for required input and valid email format.
// 6. When the submit button is pressed, the form is validated.
// 7. If validation passes, a SnackBar is shown indicating that data is being processed.
