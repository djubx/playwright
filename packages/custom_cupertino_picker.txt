# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Custom Cupertino Picker

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `custom_cupertino_picker` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `custom_cupertino_picker` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  custom_cupertino_picker: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Custom Cupertino Picker

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `custom_cupertino_picker` in your app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:custom_cupertino_picker/custom_cupertino_picker.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Custom Cupertino Picker Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Show the custom picker when the button is pressed
              showCupertinoPicker(context);
            },
            child: Text('Open Picker'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void showCupertinoPicker(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a list of items to pick from
    List<String> items = ['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3', 'Item 4'];

    // Show the custom Cupertino picker
    showModalBottomSheet(
      context: context,
      builder: (context) {
        return CustomCupertinoPicker(
          items: items,
          onSelectedItemChanged: (index) {
            // Handle the selected item
            print('Selected: ${items[index]}');
          },
        );
      },
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with a button that opens the custom Cupertino picker when pressed. The selected item is printed to the console.

# Complete Example: Custom Cupertino Picker in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:custom_cupertino_picker/custom_cupertino_picker.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Custom Cupertino Picker Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Show the custom picker when the button is pressed
              showCupertinoPicker(context);
            },
            child: Text('Open Picker'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void showCupertinoPicker(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a list of items to pick from
    List<String> items = ['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3', 'Item 4'];

    // Show the custom Cupertino picker
    showModalBottomSheet(
      context: context,
      builder: (context) {
        return CustomCupertinoPicker(
          items: items,
          onSelectedItemChanged: (index) {
            // Handle the selected item
            print('Selected: ${items[index]}');
          },
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The build method creates a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the showCupertinoPicker method is called.
// 5. The showCupertinoPicker method defines a list of items and opens a modal bottom sheet.
// 6. The CustomCupertinoPicker is displayed in the modal, allowing users to select an item.
// 7. When an item is selected, the onSelectedItemChanged callback is triggered, printing the selected item to the console.
```
