# Setting Up Dashbook
To use the Dashbook package in your Flutter application, follow these steps:

1. Add the Dashbook package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  dashbook: ^1.0.0
```
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.
3. Import the Dashbook package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:dashbook/dashbook.dart';
```
4. Create a new instance of the `Dashbook` class:
```dart
Dashbook dashbook = Dashbook();
```
5. Add widgets, charts, and tables to your dashboard using the `addWidget` method:
```dart
dashbook.addWidget(
  Text('Hello, World!'),
  properties: {
    'color': Colors.blue,
    'fontSize': 24,
  },
);
```
6. Use the `build` method to render your dashboard:
```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return dashbook.build(context);
}
```
### Platform-Specific Details
For Android and iOS platforms, you may need to add additional configurations to your `AndroidManifest.xml` and `Info.plist` files, respectively.

For Android, add the following line to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:
```xml
<application
  ...
  android:hardwareAccelerated="true"
  ...
>
```
For iOS, add the following line to your `Info.plist` file:
```xml
<key>UIViewControllerBasedStatusBarAppearance</key>
<false/>
```
### Optimizations
To improve performance, you can use the `shouldRebuild` method to determine whether your dashboard needs to be rebuilt:
```dart
@override
bool shouldRebuild(Dashbook oldDashbook) {
  return oldDashbook != dashbook;
}
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dashbook/dashbook.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dashbook Demo',
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  Dashbook _dashbook = Dashbook();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _dashbook.addWidget(
      Text('Hello, World!'),
      properties: {
        'color': Colors.blue,
        'fontSize': 24,
      },
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Dashbook Demo'),
      ),
      body: _dashbook.build(context),
    );
  }
}
```

// This is the main entry point of the application.
// The `MyApp` widget is the root of the application.
// The `MyHomePage` widget is the home page of the application.
// The `_MyHomePageState` class is the state of the home page.
// In the `initState` method, we add a new widget to the dashboard.
// In the `build` method, we render the dashboard.

// The dashboard is rendered as a `Scaffold` widget with an `AppBar` and a `body`.
// The `body` of the `Scaffold` is the dashboard itself, which is built by the `_dashbook.build` method.

// When the application is run, the dashboard is displayed with the added widget.
