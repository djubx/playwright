```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  appier_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/appier_flutter).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the necessary permissions and metadata for Appier:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.yourapp">

    <application>
        <!-- Add this line -->
        <meta-data
            android:name="appier.api_key"
            android:value="YOUR_APP_KEY" />
    </application>
</manifest>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following configuration:

```xml
<key>AppierAPIKey</key>
<string>YOUR_APP_KEY</string>
```

## Basic Usage
After setting up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s how to initialize and log events:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:appier_flutter/appier_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Initialize Appier with your API key
    Appier.init("YOUR_APP_KEY");

    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Appier Flutter Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Appier Flutter Demo')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Log a custom event
            Appier.logEvent("button_clicked", {"button_name": "Demo Button"});
          },
          child: Text('Click Me'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize the Appier SDK with our API key and log a custom event when the button is clicked.

# Complete Example of Appier Flutter Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:appier_flutter/appier_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Initialize Appier with your API key
    Appier.init("YOUR_APP_KEY");

    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Appier Flutter Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Appier Flutter Demo')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Log a custom event when the button is clicked
            Appier.logEvent("button_clicked", {"button_name": "Demo Button"});
          },
          child: Text('Click Me'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp initializes the Appier SDK with the provided API key.
// 3. The MaterialApp widget is created with a title and a home screen.
// 4. HomeScreen is a StatelessWidget that builds a simple UI with an AppBar and a button.
// 5. When the button is clicked, it triggers the onPressed callback.
// 6. Inside the callback, a custom event "button_clicked" is logged to Appier with additional data about the button.
// 7. This allows tracking of user interactions for analytics and marketing purposes.
```
