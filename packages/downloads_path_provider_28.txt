# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Downloads Path Provider 28

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `downloads_path_provider_28` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the `downloads_path_provider_28` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  downloads_path_provider_28: ^2.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file. Add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you need to add the following key to your `Info.plist` file to request permission for file access:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to the photo library.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is an example of how to retrieve the downloads directory and save a file.

# Complete Example: Using Downloads Path Provider 28

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:downloads_path_provider_28/downloads_path_provider_28.dart';
import 'dart:io';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Downloads Path Provider Example',
      home: DownloadsExample(),
    );
  }
}

class DownloadsExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DownloadsExampleState createState() => _DownloadsExampleState();
}

class _DownloadsExampleState extends State<DownloadsExample> {
  String _downloadPath = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _getDownloadsPath(); // Fetch the downloads path when the app starts
  }

  // Function to get the downloads directory path
  Future<void> _getDownloadsPath() async {
    // Retrieve the downloads directory
    final directory = await DownloadsPathProvider.downloadsDirectory;
    setState(() {
      _downloadPath = directory?.path ?? 'Unknown path'; // Update the state with the path
    });
  }

  // Function to create a sample file in the downloads directory
  Future<void> _createSampleFile() async {
    if (_downloadPath.isNotEmpty) {
      // Create a sample text file
      final file = File('$_downloadPath/sample.txt');
      await file.writeAsString('This is a sample file created using downloads_path_provider_28.');
      // Notify the user
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(SnackBar(content: Text('File created at $_downloadPath/sample.txt')));
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Downloads Path Provider Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Downloads Path: $_downloadPath'), // Display the downloads path
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _createSampleFile, // Create a sample file on button press
              child: Text('Create Sample File'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and the main function runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds the MaterialApp and sets DownloadsExample as the home.
// 3. In DownloadsExample, the initState method is called, which triggers _getDownloadsPath.
// 4. _getDownloadsPath retrieves the downloads directory and updates the state with the path.
// 5. The downloads path is displayed on the screen.
// 6. When the user presses the "Create Sample File" button, _createSampleFile is called.
// 7. A sample text file is created in the downloads directory, and a snackbar notification is shown.
