# Tutorial: Setting Up flutter_web_qrcode_scanner

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_web_qrcode_scanner` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter web application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_web_qrcode_scanner` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_web_qrcode_scanner: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_web_qrcode_scanner).

## Step 2: Configure for Web

### For Android and iOS

While this package is primarily designed for web applications, if you plan to use it in a mobile context, ensure that you have the necessary permissions set up in your `AndroidManifest.xml` for Android and `Info.plist` for iOS.

For Android, add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
```

For iOS, add the following to your `Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the camera to scan QR codes.</string>
```

### For Web

Ensure that your web application has access to the camera. This is typically handled by the browser, but you may want to inform users to allow camera access when prompted.

## Step 3: Implementing the QR Code Scanner

Now that we have set up the package, we can implement the QR code scanner in our application. Below is a simple example of how to use the `flutter_web_qrcode_scanner` package.

# Complete Example of flutter_web_qrcode_scanner

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_web_qrcode_scanner/flutter_web_qrcode_scanner.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'QR Code Scanner',
      home: QRScannerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class QRScannerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _QRScannerScreenState createState() => _QRScannerScreenState();
}

class _QRScannerScreenState extends State<QRScannerScreen> {
  String result = "Scan a QR code";

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('QR Code Scanner'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(result), // Display the scanned result
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () async {
                // Start the QR code scanning process
                String scannedResult = await FlutterWebQrScanner.scan();
                setState(() {
                  result = scannedResult; // Update the result with the scanned QR code
                });
              },
              child: Text('Start Scanning'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home screen.
// 3. The QRScannerScreen is a StatefulWidget that manages the state of the scanned result.
// 4. In the build method, we create a simple UI with a Text widget to display the scanned result and a button to start scanning.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the scan method from the FlutterWebQrScanner package is called.
// 6. The scanned result is awaited and then displayed on the screen by updating the state.
```
