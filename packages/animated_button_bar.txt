```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_button_bar/animated_button_bar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animated Button Bar Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Animated Button Bar'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: AnimatedButtonBar(
            // Define the buttons in the bar
            buttons: [
              IconButton(
                icon: Icon(Icons.home),
                onPressed: () {
                  // Action for Home button
                },
              ),
              IconButton(
                icon: Icon(Icons.search),
                onPressed: () {
                  // Action for Search button
                },
              ),
              IconButton(
                icon: Icon(Icons.notifications),
                onPressed: () {
                  // Action for Notifications button
                },
              ),
              IconButton(
                icon: Icon(Icons.person),
                onPressed: () {
                  // Action for Profile button
                },
              ),
            ],
            // Customize the animation duration and curve
            duration: Duration(milliseconds: 300),
            curve: Curves.easeInOut,
            // Set the background color of the button bar
            backgroundColor: Colors.blueAccent,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Animated Button Bar'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers an AnimatedButtonBar widget.
// 5. The AnimatedButtonBar contains a list of IconButton widgets, each representing a different action.
// 6. Each button has an onPressed callback that defines the action to be taken when the button is pressed.
// 7. The button bar is animated with a specified duration and curve, providing a smooth transition effect.
// 8. The background color of the button bar is set to blueAccent, enhancing the visual appeal.
