# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Dashed Line Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **dashed_line** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  dashed_line: ^1.0.0
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:dashed_line/dashed_line.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using Dashed Line in Your Widget

You can now use the `DashedLine` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
DashedLine(
  dashLength: 10.0, // Length of each dash
  dashColor: Colors.blue, // Color of the dashes
  dashThickness: 2.0, // Thickness of the dashes
  dashGapLength: 5.0, // Space between dashes
)
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Optimizations

- Consider using the `DashedLine` widget within a `Container` to control its size and alignment.
- Use `Expanded` or `Flexible` widgets to make the dashed line responsive to different screen sizes.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the **dashed_line** package into your Flutter application seamlessly.

# Complete Example of Using the Dashed Line Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dashed_line/dashed_line.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dashed Line Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Dashed Line Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text('Above the dashed line'),
              // Dashed line widget with custom properties
              DashedLine(
                dashLength: 10.0, // Length of each dash
                dashColor: Colors.blue, // Color of the dashes
                dashThickness: 2.0, // Thickness of the dashes
                dashGapLength: 5.0, // Space between dashes
              ),
              Text('Below the dashed line'),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Dashed Line Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Column widget.
// 5. The Column has two Text widgets and a DashedLine widget in between.
// 6. The DashedLine widget is configured with specific dash properties, creating a visual divider.
// 7. The app displays text above and below the dashed line, demonstrating its use in a simple layout.
```
