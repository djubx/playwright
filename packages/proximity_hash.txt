# Proximity Hash Flutter Package

The **proximity_hash** package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to implement proximity-based hashing functionalities in their applications. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to determine the proximity of items based on their geographical coordinates. It can be applied in various domains, such as location-based services, social networking apps, and any application that requires spatial awareness.

## When to Use This Package
- **Location-Based Services**: When you need to find nearby users or places based on geographical coordinates.
- **Social Networking**: To suggest friends or connections based on proximity.
- **Geofencing**: To trigger events when a user enters or exits a defined geographical area.

## Key Features
- **Efficient Proximity Calculation**: Quickly calculates the proximity of items based on their latitude and longitude.
- **Customizable Hashing**: Allows developers to customize the hashing mechanism to suit specific needs.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate into existing Flutter applications with minimal setup.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Proximity Hash

## Installation
To get started with the **proximity_hash** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  proximity_hash: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/proximity_hash).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file to access location services:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you need to add the following keys to your `Info.plist` to request location permissions:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to find nearby users.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to provide better services.</string>
```

## Using the Package
Once you have installed the package and configured the necessary permissions, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the **proximity_hash** package to calculate the proximity of two locations.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:proximity_hash/proximity_hash.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Example coordinates
    final location1 = LatLng(37.7749, -122.4194); // San Francisco
    final location2 = LatLng(34.0522, -118.2437); // Los Angeles

    // Calculate proximity
    final proximity = ProximityHash.calculateProximity(location1, location2);

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Proximity Hash Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Proximity: $proximity'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to calculate the proximity between two geographical points and display the result in a Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Proximity Hash

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:proximity_hash/proximity_hash.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Define two locations using latitude and longitude
    final location1 = LatLng(37.7749, -122.4194); // San Francisco
    final location2 = LatLng(34.0522, -118.2437); // Los Angeles

    // Calculate the proximity between the two locations
    final proximity = ProximityHash.calculateProximity(location1, location2);

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Proximity Hash Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Display the calculated proximity
          child: Text('Proximity: $proximity'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the Flutter application by calling runApp() with RealFlutter as the root widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget, two geographical locations are defined using their latitude and longitude.
// 3. The ProximityHash.calculateProximity method is called with the two locations to compute the proximity value.
// 4. The result is displayed in the center of the screen using a Text widget.
// 5. The app has a simple UI with an AppBar and a centered text showing the proximity value.
