Here's a detailed technical blog on the "typed_result" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Typed Result Flutter Package

The `typed_result` package in Flutter is a powerful utility designed to simplify error handling and result management in Dart applications. It provides a type-safe way to handle results from functions, allowing developers to distinguish between successful outcomes and errors without resorting to exceptions. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where functions can return multiple types of results, such as API calls, database queries, or any asynchronous operations.

## When to Use `typed_result`

You should consider using the `typed_result` package in the following scenarios:

- **API Calls**: When making network requests, you can use `typed_result` to handle both successful responses and errors in a clean and type-safe manner.
- **Database Operations**: For operations that can succeed or fail, such as fetching data from a database, `typed_result` helps manage the outcomes effectively.
- **Complex Business Logic**: In applications with intricate business rules, using `typed_result` can help clarify the flow of data and error handling.

## Features

- **Type Safety**: Ensures that the result types are explicitly defined, reducing runtime errors.
- **Error Handling**: Provides a structured way to handle errors without using exceptions.
- **Ease of Use**: Simple API that integrates seamlessly with existing Dart and Flutter code.

## Example Usage

Here’s a simple example of how to use the `typed_result` package:

```dart
import 'package:typed_result/typed_result.dart';

Result<String, String> fetchData() {
  // Simulating a successful API call
  return Result.success("Data fetched successfully");
}

void main() {
  final result = fetchData();
  
  result.when(
    success: (data) => print(data),
    error: (error) => print("Error: $error"),
  );
}
```

In this example, the `fetchData` function returns a `Result` object that can either be a success or an error. The `when` method is used to handle both cases appropriately.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Typed Result Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `typed_result` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  typed_result: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure your `ios/Podfile` has the platform version set to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Here’s a simple example of how to implement it:

1. Import the package:

```dart
import 'package:typed_result/typed_result.dart';
```

2. Create a function that returns a `Result`:

```dart
Result<String, String> performOperation() {
  // Simulating an operation that can succeed or fail
  bool success = true; // Change this to false to simulate an error
  if (success) {
    return Result.success("Operation completed successfully");
  } else {
    return Result.error("Operation failed");
  }
}
```

3. Handle the result:

```dart
void main() {
  final result = performOperation();
  
  result.when(
    success: (data) => print(data),
    error: (error) => print("Error: $error"),
  );
}
```

This setup allows you to manage results effectively, ensuring that your application can handle both success and error cases gracefully.

# Complete Example of Using Typed Result

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:typed_result/typed_result.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Typed Result Example',
      home: ResultScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ResultScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  // Function that simulates an operation returning a Result
  Result<String, String> fetchData() {
    // Simulating a successful API call
    bool isSuccess = true; // Change to false to simulate an error
    if (isSuccess) {
      return Result.success("Data fetched successfully");
    } else {
      return Result.error("Failed to fetch data");
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Fetching data and storing the result
    final result = fetchData();

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Typed Result Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: result.when(
          success: (data) => Text(data, style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24)),
          error: (error) => Text("Error: $error", style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.red)),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (ResultScreen).
// 3. In ResultScreen, the fetchData function simulates an API call that can succeed or fail.
// 4. The result of fetchData is stored in the result variable.
// 5. The build method uses the result.when method to display either the success message or the error message.
// 6. If the operation is successful, it shows "Data fetched successfully"; otherwise, it shows the error message.
```
