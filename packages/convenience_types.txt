# Convenience Types Flutter Package

The `convenience_types` package is a Flutter library designed to simplify the handling of common data types in Dart. It provides a set of convenience classes that enhance the usability of standard types, making it easier for developers to work with nullable types, collections, and more. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to avoid boilerplate code and improve code readability.

## When to Use This Package
- **Nullable Types**: When you need to handle nullable types more gracefully.
- **Collections**: When you want to work with collections without worrying about null checks.
- **Type Safety**: When you want to enforce type safety in your applications.

## Key Features
- **Nullable Handling**: Simplifies the management of nullable types.
- **Enhanced Collections**: Provides utility methods for collections, making operations like filtering and mapping more straightforward.
- **Type Safety**: Ensures that your code adheres to type safety principles, reducing runtime errors.

Overall, `convenience_types` is a valuable addition to any Flutter developer's toolkit, especially for those looking to streamline their code and improve maintainability.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Convenience Types

## Installation
To add the `convenience_types` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  convenience_types: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
The `convenience_types` package is designed to work seamlessly across both Android and iOS platforms. There are no additional platform-specific configurations required for basic usage. However, ensure that your Flutter environment is set up correctly for both platforms.

## Basic Usage
To use the `convenience_types` package, you can import it into your Dart files:

```dart
import 'package:convenience_types/convenience_types.dart';
```

You can then utilize its features, such as handling nullable types and working with collections. For example:

```dart
void main() {
  // Using NullableType to handle a nullable integer
  NullableType<int> nullableInt = NullableType<int>(null);
  print(nullableInt.valueOrDefault(0)); // Outputs: 0
}
```

This example demonstrates how to create a nullable integer and provide a default value if it is null.

By following these steps, you can easily integrate the `convenience_types` package into your Flutter applications and start leveraging its features to write cleaner and more efficient code.

# Complete Example of Convenience Types

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:convenience_types/convenience_types.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Convenience Types Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Convenience Types Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Using NullableType to handle a nullable string
              Text(
                'Nullable String: ${NullableType<String>(null).valueOrDefault("Default Value")}',
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Using ListType to handle a list of integers
              Text(
                'List of Integers: ${ListType<int>([1, 2, 3]).map((e) => e * 2).toList()}',
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the Flutter application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Convenience Types Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Column widget.
// 5. Inside the Column, we display two Text widgets:
//    - The first Text widget uses NullableType to handle a nullable string and provides a default value if null.
//    - The second Text widget uses ListType to create a list of integers, mapping each integer to its double value.
// 6. The application demonstrates how to use the convenience types to manage nullable values and collections effectively.
