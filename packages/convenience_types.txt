In summary, the `convenience_types` package provides a set of utility types and functions to simplify the development process. The `UnionType` feature allows combining multiple types into a single type, and the `when` method is used to handle the different types. The example code demonstrates the usage of the `UnionType` feature and the application flow is explained in the comments.
