# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Custom Sliding Segmented Control

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `custom_sliding_segmented_control` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  custom_sliding_segmented_control: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:custom_sliding_segmented_control/custom_sliding_segmented_control.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

You can use the `CustomSlidingSegmentedControl` widget in your Flutter application as follows:

```dart
CustomSlidingSegmentedControl<int>(
  children: {
    0: Text('Option 1'),
    1: Text('Option 2'),
    2: Text('Option 3'),
  },
  onValueChanged: (value) {
    // Handle value change
  },
)
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Optimizations

- **Performance**: Use the `CustomSlidingSegmentedControl` in a stateless widget to improve performance.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure that the text labels are descriptive for screen readers.

With these steps, you can successfully integrate and use the `custom_sliding_segmented_control` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Custom Sliding Segmented Control

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:custom_sliding_segmented_control/custom_sliding_segmented_control.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Custom Sliding Segmented Control Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Custom Sliding Segmented Control'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: SlidingSegmentedControlDemo(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SlidingSegmentedControlDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SlidingSegmentedControlDemoState createState() => _SlidingSegmentedControlDemoState();
}

class _SlidingSegmentedControlDemoState extends State<SlidingSegmentedControlDemo> {
  // Variable to hold the selected segment value
  int _selectedSegment = 0;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        // Custom Sliding Segmented Control
        CustomSlidingSegmentedControl<int>(
          children: {
            0: Text('Option 1'),
            1: Text('Option 2'),
            2: Text('Option 3'),
          },
          onValueChanged: (value) {
            // Update the selected segment when the user changes it
            setState(() {
              _selectedSegment = value!;
            });
          },
          // Set the initial selected value
          groupValue: _selectedSegment,
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20),
        // Display the selected option
        Text(
          'Selected Option: ${_selectedSegment + 1}',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The home of the MaterialApp is a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. The Center widget contains the SlidingSegmentedControlDemo widget.
// 5. SlidingSegmentedControlDemo is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the selected segment.
// 6. The CustomSlidingSegmentedControl widget is created with three options.
// 7. When a user selects an option, the onValueChanged callback updates the _selectedSegment variable.
// 8. The selected option is displayed below the segmented control, updating dynamically as the user interacts with it.
