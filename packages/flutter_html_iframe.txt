# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_html_iframe

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_html_iframe` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_html_iframe` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_html_iframe: ^0.2.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file allows internet access. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permission:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to enable App Transport Security (ATS) if you are loading content from non-secure HTTP sources. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in a Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to render HTML content with an iframe.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_html_iframe/flutter_html_iframe.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter HTML Iframe Example'),
        ),
        body: SingleChildScrollView(
          child: HtmlIframe(
            // The HTML content with an iframe
            html: """
              <h1>Welcome to Flutter HTML Iframe</h1>
              <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ" width="100%" height="300" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            """,
            // Optional: Customize the iframe properties
            width: double.infinity,
            height: 300,
            // Optional: Enable scrolling
            scrollable: true,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays a YouTube video embedded in an iframe.

# Complete Example of flutter_html_iframe

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_html_iframe/flutter_html_iframe.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter HTML Iframe Example'), // Title of the app
        ),
        body: SingleChildScrollView(
          child: HtmlIframe(
            // The HTML content with an iframe
            html: """
              <h1>Welcome to Flutter HTML Iframe</h1>
              <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ" width="100%" height="300" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            """,
            // Optional: Customize the iframe properties
            width: double.infinity, // Set iframe width to fill the screen
            height: 300, // Set iframe height
            // Optional: Enable scrolling
            scrollable: true, // Allow scrolling if content overflows
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the `RealFlutter` class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The `MaterialApp` widget is created, providing the basic material design structure.
// 3. A `Scaffold` widget is used to create the app's layout, including an AppBar and body.
// 4. The AppBar displays the title of the application.
// 5. The body contains a `SingleChildScrollView` to allow scrolling of the content.
// 6. Inside the scroll view, the `HtmlIframe` widget is used to render HTML content.
// 7. The HTML content includes a heading and an iframe that embeds a YouTube video.
// 8. The iframe is set to take the full width of the screen and has a fixed height of 300 pixels.
// 9. The `scrollable` property is set to true, allowing users to scroll if the content exceeds the screen height.
```
