# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the barcode_image Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `barcode_image` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  barcode_image: ^2.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you plan to access the camera or other device features. However, for barcode generation, no special permissions are required.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to generate a barcode.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:barcode_image/barcode_image.dart';
```

2. Use the `BarcodeImage` widget to display a barcode:

```dart
BarcodeImage(
  data: '123456789012', // The data to encode
  codeType: BarcodeCode.Code128, // The type of barcode
  lineWidth: 2.0, // Width of the lines
  barHeight: 100.0, // Height of the barcode
  hasText: true, // Whether to show the text below the barcode
)
```

With these steps, you can easily integrate barcode generation into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using the barcode_image Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:barcode_image/barcode_image.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Barcode Image Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Barcode Image Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying the barcode image
              BarcodeImage(
                data: '123456789012', // The data to encode
                codeType: BarcodeCode.Code128, // The type of barcode
                lineWidth: 2.0, // Width of the lines
                barHeight: 100.0, // Height of the barcode
                hasText: true, // Whether to show the text below the barcode
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between barcode and text
              Text(
                'Barcode for 123456789012', // Description of the barcode
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Barcode Image Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Column widget.
// 5. Inside the Column, a BarcodeImage widget is created, which generates a barcode for the data '123456789012'.
// 6. The barcode is displayed with a specified line width and height, and the text below it indicates what the barcode represents.
// 7. The app is simple and demonstrates the basic functionality of generating and displaying a barcode using the barcode_image package.
