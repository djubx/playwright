# Flutter Package: framework

The `framework` package in Flutter is a powerful tool designed to facilitate the development of complex applications by providing a structured way to manage the app's architecture. It is particularly useful for developers looking to implement a clean architecture pattern, enabling better separation of concerns and easier testing.

## When to Use This Package
- **Complex Applications**: When building applications with multiple layers (presentation, domain, data), the `framework` package helps maintain a clean structure.
- **Scalability**: Ideal for projects that are expected to grow over time, as it allows for easier management of code.
- **Testability**: The package promotes a design that makes unit testing and integration testing more straightforward.

## Key Features
- **Separation of Concerns**: Encourages a clear division between different layers of the application.
- **Dependency Injection**: Simplifies the management of dependencies across the app.
- **State Management**: Provides tools to manage the state of the application effectively.
- **Modular Architecture**: Supports a modular approach, making it easier to manage and scale the application.

# Setting Up the framework Package

To get started with the `framework` package, follow these steps:

## Installation

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `framework` package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     framework: ^latest_version
   ```

   Replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/framework).

2. **Run Flutter Packages Get**: After saving the `pubspec.yaml`, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
- Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS
- For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

## Basic Usage

To use the `framework` package, you typically start by creating a main class that extends the `RealFlutter` class. This class will serve as the entry point for your application.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:framework/framework.dart';

class MyApp extends RealFlutter {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Framework Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, `MyApp` extends `RealFlutter`, which allows you to leverage the features provided by the `framework` package.

# Complete Example of Using the framework Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:framework/framework.dart';

// Main entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// MyApp class extending RealFlutter to utilize framework features
class MyApp extends RealFlutter {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Framework Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

// HomeScreen widget demonstrating the use of framework
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate to the DetailScreen when the button is pressed
            Navigator.push(
              context,
              MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => DetailScreen()),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Go to Detail Screen'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// DetailScreen widget to show details
class DetailScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Detail Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('This is the detail screen!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets HomeScreen as the home widget.
// 3. HomeScreen displays a button in the center of the screen.
// 4. When the button is pressed, it navigates to DetailScreen using Navigator.push.
// 5. DetailScreen displays a simple text message when navigated to.
