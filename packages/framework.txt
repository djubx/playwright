// This code defines a complete Flutter app with a material design theme and a single text widget that displays the text "You have pushed the button this many times:".
// The app also includes a FloatingActionButton that increments a counter variable when pressed.
// The counter value is displayed on the screen using a Text widget.
// The app uses the setState function to update the counter variable and the UI in real-time.
// The main function launches the app using the runApp function.
// The MyApp class defines the app's title, theme, and home screen.
// The RealFlutter class defines the app's UI and behavior.
// The _RealFlutterState class defines the app's state and behavior.
