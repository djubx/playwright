# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Cupertino Onboarding

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **cupertino_onboarding** package and demonstrate how to implement it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the **cupertino_onboarding** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cupertino_onboarding: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install Packages

Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: iOS Configuration

For iOS, ensure that your app's deployment target is set to at least iOS 10.0. You can do this by modifying the `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in the `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

## Step 5: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:cupertino_onboarding/cupertino_onboarding.dart';
```

## Step 6: Implementing the Onboarding Flow

You can now implement the onboarding flow in your application. Below is a simple example of how to use the **cupertino_onboarding** package.

# Complete Example: Implementing Cupertino Onboarding

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cupertino_onboarding/cupertino_onboarding.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Cupertino Onboarding Example',
      home: OnboardingScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class OnboardingScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return CupertinoOnboarding(
      pages: [
        // First onboarding page
        OnboardingPage(
          title: 'Welcome to Our App',
          description: 'Discover amazing features and functionalities.',
          image: AssetImage('assets/images/onboarding1.png'), // Add your image here
        ),
        // Second onboarding page
        OnboardingPage(
          title: 'Stay Connected',
          description: 'Connect with friends and family easily.',
          image: AssetImage('assets/images/onboarding2.png'), // Add your image here
        ),
        // Third onboarding page
        OnboardingPage(
          title: 'Get Started',
          description: 'Let\'s get started with your journey!',
          image: AssetImage('assets/images/onboarding3.png'), // Add your image here
        ),
      ],
      onFinish: () {
        // Action to perform when onboarding is finished
        Navigator.of(context).pushReplacement(
          MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => HomeScreen()),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Welcome to the Home Screen!')),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with the title 'Cupertino Onboarding Example'.
// 3. The OnboardingScreen widget is set as the home screen of the app.
// 4. Inside OnboardingScreen, we create a CupertinoOnboarding widget with three onboarding pages.
// 5. Each OnboardingPage contains a title, description, and an image.
// 6. When the user finishes the onboarding process, the onFinish callback is triggered, navigating to the HomeScreen.
// 7. The HomeScreen displays a simple welcome message to the user.
```
