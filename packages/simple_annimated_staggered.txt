# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Simple Animated Staggered

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `simple_animated_staggered` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  simple_animated_staggered: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Open the `Podfile` and uncomment the platform line, setting it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement staggered animations using the `simple_animated_staggered` package.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simple_animated_staggered/simple_animated_staggered.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Simple Animated Staggered Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Staggered Animation Example'),
        ),
        body: StaggeredAnimationExample(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class StaggeredAnimationExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(
      child: SimpleAnimatedStaggered(
        duration: Duration(milliseconds: 500), // Set the duration of the animation
        children: [
          // Each child will animate in a staggered manner
          Container(
            width: 100,
            height: 100,
            color: Colors.red,
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between the boxes
          Container(
            width: 100,
            height: 100,
            color: Colors.green,
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between the boxes
          Container(
            width: 100,
            height: 100,
            color: Colors.blue,
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a body that displays the StaggeredAnimationExample widget.
// 4. In StaggeredAnimationExample, SimpleAnimatedStaggered is used to create staggered animations for its children.
// 5. Each child (Container) is animated to appear one after the other, creating a visually appealing staggered effect.
```
