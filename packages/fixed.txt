Here's a detailed technical blog on the "fixed" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Fixed Flutter Package

The **fixed** Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to help developers manage and manipulate fixed-point arithmetic in their applications. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where precision is critical, such as financial applications, scientific calculations, or any domain where floating-point inaccuracies can lead to significant errors.

## When to Use the Fixed Package

You should consider using the fixed package in the following scenarios:

- **Financial Applications**: When dealing with currency calculations, where precision is paramount.
- **Scientific Calculations**: In cases where small errors can propagate and lead to incorrect results.
- **Game Development**: For physics calculations where fixed-point arithmetic can provide better performance on certain platforms.

## Features

- **Fixed-Point Arithmetic**: Provides a way to perform arithmetic operations with fixed-point numbers.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to add to your Flutter project with minimal setup.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

The fixed package allows developers to define fixed-point numbers and perform operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with ease. It abstracts the complexity of managing precision, making it a valuable addition to any Flutter developer's toolkit.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Fixed Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the fixed package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  fixed: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 3: Using the Fixed Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create and manipulate fixed-point numbers.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fixed/fixed.dart'; // Import the fixed package

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Fixed Package Example',
      home: FixedExample(),
    );
  }
}

class FixedExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create fixed-point numbers
    Fixed a = Fixed.fromInt(100); // Represents 1.00
    Fixed b = Fixed.fromInt(200); // Represents 2.00

    // Perform arithmetic operations
    Fixed sum = a + b; // 3.00
    Fixed difference = b - a; // 1.00
    Fixed product = a * b; // 2.00
    Fixed quotient = b / a; // 2.00

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Fixed Package Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Sum: $sum'),
            Text('Difference: $difference'),
            Text('Product: $product'),
            Text('Quotient: $quotient'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of fixed-point arithmetic.

# Complete Example of Using the Fixed Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fixed/fixed.dart'; // Import the fixed package

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Fixed Package Example',
      home: FixedExample(),
    );
  }
}

class FixedExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create fixed-point numbers
    Fixed a = Fixed.fromInt(100); // Represents 1.00
    Fixed b = Fixed.fromInt(200); // Represents 2.00

    // Perform arithmetic operations
    Fixed sum = a + b; // 3.00
    Fixed difference = b - a; // 1.00
    Fixed product = a * b; // 2.00
    Fixed quotient = b / a; // 2.00

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Fixed Package Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Sum: $sum'), // Display the sum
            Text('Difference: $difference'), // Display the difference
            Text('Product: $product'), // Display the product
            Text('Quotient: $quotient'), // Display the quotient
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget (FixedExample).
// 3. FixedExample creates two fixed-point numbers, a and b, representing 1.00 and 2.00 respectively.
// 4. It performs arithmetic operations: sum, difference, product, and quotient.
// 5. The results of these operations are displayed in the center of the screen using Text widgets.
// 6. The app provides a simple interface to demonstrate the capabilities of the fixed package.
```
