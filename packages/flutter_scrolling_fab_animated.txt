# flutter_scrolling_fab_animated: A Comprehensive Overview

The `flutter_scrolling_fab_animated` package is a Flutter library designed to enhance the user experience by providing an animated Floating Action Button (FAB) that responds to scrolling. This package is particularly useful in applications where a FAB is needed to perform actions that are contextually relevant to the content being displayed, such as adding new items or performing searches.

## When to Use This Package
- **Dynamic Content**: When your app has a list or scrollable content, and you want the FAB to appear or disappear based on the user's scroll direction.
- **Enhanced UX**: To provide a more engaging user experience by animating the FAB, making it more visually appealing.
- **Contextual Actions**: When actions associated with the FAB are relevant to the content being viewed, improving usability.

## Key Features
- **Scroll Detection**: Automatically detects scroll events and animates the FAB accordingly.
- **Customizable Animation**: Offers options to customize the animation duration and curve.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate into existing Flutter applications with minimal setup.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across different screen sizes and orientations.

Overall, `flutter_scrolling_fab_animated` is an excellent choice for developers looking to implement a responsive and animated FAB in their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_scrolling_fab_animated

## Installation
To use the `flutter_scrolling_fab_animated` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_scrolling_fab_animated: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `flutter_scrolling_fab_animated` package, you need to wrap your scrollable widget (like `ListView`) with the `ScrollingFab` widget. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_scrolling_fab_animated/flutter_scrolling_fab_animated.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Scrolling FAB Example')),
      body: ScrollingFab(
        fab: FloatingActionButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Action when FAB is pressed
          },
          child: Icon(Icons.add),
        ),
        child: ListView.builder(
          itemCount: 100,
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            return ListTile(title: Text('Item $index'));
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `ScrollingFab` widget wraps a `ListView`, and the FAB will animate based on the scroll position of the list.

# Complete Example of flutter_scrolling_fab_animated

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_scrolling_fab_animated/flutter_scrolling_fab_animated.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Scrolling FAB Example')),
        body: ScrollingFab(
          fab: FloatingActionButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Action when FAB is pressed
              print('FAB Pressed');
            },
            child: Icon(Icons.add),
          ),
          child: ListView.builder(
            itemCount: 100, // Number of items in the list
            itemBuilder: (context, index) {
              return ListTile(title: Text('Item $index')); // Displaying each item
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body uses the ScrollingFab widget, which takes a FloatingActionButton (FAB) and a child widget.
// 5. The FAB is configured to print a message when pressed.
// 6. The child of ScrollingFab is a ListView.builder that creates a list of 100 items.
// 7. As the user scrolls through the list, the FAB will animate in and out based on the scroll position, enhancing the user experience.
