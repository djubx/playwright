# Gridded PageView: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To use the **gridded_pageview** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  gridded_pageview: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/gridded_pageview).

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to set the platform version in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the **gridded_pageview** package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:gridded_pageview/gridded_pageview.dart';
```

You can then create a simple grid view by using the `GriddedPageView` widget. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
GriddedPageView(
  itemCount: 100, // Total number of items
  gridDelegate: SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount(
    crossAxisCount: 3, // Number of columns
  ),
  itemBuilder: (context, index) {
    return Container(
      color: Colors.blue,
      child: Center(child: Text('Item $index')),
    );
  },
);
```

This code snippet creates a grid view with 100 items, displaying three items per row.

## Best Practices
- **Performance**: Use `ListView.builder` or similar methods to improve performance when dealing with a large number of items.
- **Customization**: Customize the grid layout and item appearance to match your app's design.
- **Testing**: Test on both Android and iOS to ensure consistent behavior across platforms.

By following these steps, you can effectively integrate the **gridded_pageview** package into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Gridded PageView

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gridded_pageview/gridded_pageview.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Gridded PageView Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Gridded PageView Example'),
      ),
      body: GriddedPageView(
        itemCount: 100, // Total number of items
        gridDelegate: SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount(
          crossAxisCount: 3, // Number of columns in the grid
        ),
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return Container(
            margin: EdgeInsets.all(8.0), // Margin around each item
            color: Colors.blue, // Background color of each item
            child: Center(
              child: Text(
                'Item $index', // Display item index
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 16),
              ),
            ),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body contains a GriddedPageView widget that displays 100 items in a grid format.
// 5. Each grid item is a Container with a blue background and centered text showing the item index.
// 6. The grid layout is defined to have 3 columns, and each item has a margin for spacing.
