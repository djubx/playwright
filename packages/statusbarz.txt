# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Statusbarz

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **statusbarz** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  statusbarz: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, you may need to ensure that your app's theme supports a transparent status bar. Open `android/app/src/main/res/values/styles.xml` and modify your theme as follows:

```xml
<resources>
    <style name="AppTheme" parent="Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar">
        <item name="android:windowTranslucentStatus">true</item>
        <item name="android:statusBarColor">@android:color/transparent</item>
    </style>
</resources>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to adjust the `Info.plist` file to allow for a transparent status bar. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>UIViewControllerBasedStatusBarAppearance</key>
<false/>
```

## Step 4: Using Statusbarz in Your App

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:statusbarz/statusbarz.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Statusbarz Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Change the status bar color to blue
              Statusbarz.setColor(Colors.blue);
            },
            child: Text('Change Status Bar Color'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, the status bar color changes to blue.

# Complete Example of Statusbarz in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:statusbarz/statusbarz.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Initialize the Statusbarz package
    Statusbarz.init();

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Statusbarz Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Change the status bar color to blue
                  Statusbarz.setColor(Colors.blue);
                },
                child: Text('Change Status Bar Color'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Hide the status bar
                  Statusbarz.hide();
                },
                child: Text('Hide Status Bar'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Show the status bar
                  Statusbarz.show();
                },
                child: Text('Show Status Bar'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. Inside RealFlutter, the Statusbarz package is initialized.
// 3. The MaterialApp widget is created, containing a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. The Center widget contains a Column with three buttons:
//    - The first button changes the status bar color to blue when pressed.
//    - The second button hides the status bar when pressed.
//    - The third button shows the status bar when pressed.
// 5. Each button triggers a specific function from the Statusbarz package to manipulate the status bar's appearance and visibility.
