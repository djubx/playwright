# Overview of the `print_remover` Flutter Package

The `print_remover` package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who want to clean up their code by removing all print statements. This package is particularly useful in production environments where print statements can clutter logs and potentially expose sensitive information.

## When to Use `print_remover`

- **Production Readiness**: Before deploying your app, it's crucial to ensure that no debug print statements are left in the code. This package automates the removal process, saving time and reducing human error.
- **Code Cleanliness**: Maintaining a clean codebase is essential for readability and maintainability. Removing unnecessary print statements helps achieve this goal.
- **Performance Optimization**: Print statements can slow down your app, especially if they are executed frequently. Removing them can lead to performance improvements.

## Features

- **Automated Removal**: Automatically scans and removes all print statements from your Dart files.
- **Configurable**: Allows customization of which files or directories to include or exclude.
- **Safe Operation**: Provides a dry-run mode to preview changes before applying them.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `print_remover`

In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of setting up and using the `print_remover` package in a Flutter project. We'll cover platform-specific details for both Android and iOS.

## Setup Process

1. **Add Dependency**: First, add `print_remover` to your `pubspec.yaml` file.

   ```yaml
   dev_dependencies:
     print_remover: ^1.0.0
   ```

2. **Install Package**: Run the following command to install the package.

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Configuration**: Create a configuration file named `print_remover.yaml` in the root of your project to specify which files or directories to include or exclude.

   ```yaml
   include:
     - lib/**
   exclude:
     - lib/generated/**
   ```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

- Ensure that your `build.gradle` files are correctly configured to include the `print_remover` package as part of your build process.
- No additional Android-specific configuration is required for `print_remover`.

### iOS

- Make sure your `Podfile` is up to date by running `pod install` after adding the package.
- No additional iOS-specific configuration is required for `print_remover`.

## Running the Package

To execute the `print_remover`, use the following command:

```bash
flutter pub run print_remover
```

This command will remove all print statements from the files specified in your configuration.

# Complete Example: Using `print_remover` in a Flutter App

Below is a complete Flutter main file that demonstrates the use of the `print_remover` package. The code includes stepwise comments to explain each part.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutterApp());
}

// The main widget of the application
class RealFlutterApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // MaterialApp is the root of the application
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Print Remover Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

// HomeScreen widget that displays a simple UI
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Scaffold provides the basic material design visual layout structure
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // This print statement will be removed by print_remover
            print('Button Pressed!');
          },
          child: Text('Press Me'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// Application Flow Explanation
// 1. The `main` function is the entry point of the Flutter application, which calls `runApp` with `RealFlutterApp`.
// 2. `RealFlutterApp` is a stateless widget that builds a `MaterialApp`.
// 3. `MaterialApp` sets up the app's theme and home screen, which is `HomeScreen`.
// 4. `HomeScreen` is another stateless widget that uses a `Scaffold` to create a basic app structure with an `AppBar` and a `Center` widget.
// 5. Inside the `Center` widget, an `ElevatedButton` is placed, which, when pressed, triggers a print statement.
// 6. The `print_remover` package will automatically remove the print statement during the build process, ensuring no debug prints are left in the production code.
