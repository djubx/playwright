In summary, the code flow is as follows:

*   The user runs the app, and a new instance of the `TodoDatabase` class is created.
*   The app creates a new todo item and inserts it into the database using the `insert` method.
*   The app reads all todo items from the database using the `select` method and displays them in a list.
*   The user can update a todo item by tapping on it and entering new text, and the app updates the todo item in the database using the `update` method.
*   The user can delete a todo item by tapping on it and confirming deletion, and the app deletes the todo item from the database using the `delete` method.

Overall, the code demonstrates a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation using the Drift Flutter package.
