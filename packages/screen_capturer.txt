# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `screen_capturer`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `screen_capturer` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  screen_capturer: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request permissions:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save screenshots.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera for screen capturing.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to capture the screen.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:screen_capturer/screen_capturer.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to hold the captured image path
  String? _capturedImagePath;

  // Function to capture the screen
  void _captureScreen() async {
    try {
      // Start capturing the screen
      final path = await ScreenCapturer.capture();
      setState(() {
        _capturedImagePath = path; // Update the state with the captured image path
      });
    } catch (e) {
      print("Error capturing screen: $e");
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Screen Capturer Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _captureScreen,
              child: Text('Capture Screen'),
            ),
            if (_capturedImagePath != null)
              Image.file(File(_capturedImagePath!)), // Display the captured image
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that captures the screen when a button is pressed. The captured image is then displayed on the screen.

# Complete Example of `screen_capturer`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:screen_capturer/screen_capturer.dart';
import 'dart:io';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to hold the captured image path
  String? _capturedImagePath;

  // Function to capture the screen
  void _captureScreen() async {
    try {
      // Start capturing the screen
      final path = await ScreenCapturer.capture();
      setState(() {
        _capturedImagePath = path; // Update the state with the captured image path
      });
    } catch (e) {
      print("Error capturing screen: $e");
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Screen Capturer Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _captureScreen, // Capture screen on button press
              child: Text('Capture Screen'),
            ),
            if (_capturedImagePath != null)
              Image.file(File(_capturedImagePath!)), // Display the captured image
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The main function to run the app
void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    home: RealFlutter(), // Set the home widget to RealFlutter
  ));
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MaterialApp.
2. The RealFlutter widget is set as the home widget.
3. Inside RealFlutter, we have a button that, when pressed, calls the _captureScreen function.
4. The _captureScreen function uses the ScreenCapturer package to capture the screen.
5. If the capture is successful, the path of the captured image is stored in _capturedImagePath.
6. The captured image is displayed on the screen using an Image widget if _capturedImagePath is not null.
