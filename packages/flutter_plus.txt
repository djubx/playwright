# Complete Example of flutter_plus

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_plus/flutter_plus.dart'; // Importing the flutter_plus package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the RealFlutter app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Plus Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(), // Setting the home page to HomePage widget
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Plus Demo'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Welcome to Flutter Plus!',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24), // Displaying welcome text
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between widgets
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Using a utility function from flutter_plus to show a message
                showMessage(context, 'Button Pressed!');
              },
              child: Text('Press Me'), // Button text
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void showMessage(BuildContext context, String message) {
    // Function to show a snackbar message
    ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
      SnackBar(content: Text(message)), // Displaying the message
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to HomePage, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 4. HomePage contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the welcome text and button vertically.
// 6. When the button is pressed, the showMessage function is called, which displays a snackbar with a message.
// 7. The snackbar provides feedback to the user, indicating that the button was pressed.
