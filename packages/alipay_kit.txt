# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Alipay Kit

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `alipay_kit` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `alipay_kit` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  alipay_kit: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/alipay_kit).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions and activity:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>

<application>
    ...
    <activity
        android:name="com.alipay.sdk.app.H5PayActivity"
        android:exported="true">
    </activity>
</application>
```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
    <string>alipay</string>
</array>
```

2. **CocoaPods**: Ensure you have the latest version of CocoaPods installed and run `pod install` in the `ios` directory.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let’s see how to use it in our Flutter application.

### Basic Usage Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:alipay_kit/alipay_kit.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Alipay Kit Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Alipay Kit Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initiate the payment process
              String orderInfo = "your_order_info"; // Replace with your order info
              try {
                // Call the Alipay payment method
                var result = await AlipayKit.pay(orderInfo);
                // Handle the payment result
                if (result == '9000') {
                  // Payment successful
                  print('Payment Successful');
                } else {
                  // Payment failed
                  print('Payment Failed: $result');
                }
              } catch (e) {
                // Handle any errors
                print('Error: $e');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Pay with Alipay'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );

}
```

# Complete Example of Alipay Kit in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:alipay_kit/alipay_kit.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Alipay Kit Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Alipay Kit Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Step 1: Prepare the order information
              String orderInfo = "your_order_info"; // Replace with your actual order info
              
              try {
                // Step 2: Call the Alipay payment method
                var result = await AlipayKit.pay(orderInfo);
                
                // Step 3: Handle the payment result
                if (result == '9000') {
                  // Payment successful
                  print('Payment Successful');
                } else {
                  // Payment failed
                  print('Payment Failed: $result');
                }
              } catch (e) {
                // Step 4: Handle any errors that occur during the payment process
                print('Error: $e');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Pay with Alipay'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which sets up a MaterialApp.
// 2. The home screen contains an AppBar and a button labeled "Pay with Alipay."
// 3. When the button is pressed, it prepares the order information required for the payment.
// 4. It then calls the AlipayKit's pay method with the order information.
// 5. The result of the payment is checked; if it returns '9000', the payment is successful.
// 6. If the payment fails or an error occurs, appropriate messages are printed to the console.
```
