# Mimir Flutter Package: A Comprehensive Overview

The **Mimir** package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who want to implement a robust and flexible state management solution. It provides a simple yet effective way to manage application state, making it easier to build responsive and maintainable applications. Mimir is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to manage complex state interactions, such as in large applications with multiple screens and data sources.

## When to Use Mimir
- **Complex State Management**: When your application has multiple states that need to be managed across different widgets.
- **Reactive Programming**: If you want to leverage reactive programming principles to update your UI based on state changes.
- **Separation of Concerns**: When you want to separate your business logic from your UI code for better maintainability.

## Key Features
- **Reactive State Management**: Automatically updates the UI when the state changes.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate into existing Flutter applications.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead, making it suitable for performance-sensitive applications.
- **Support for Async Operations**: Easily manage asynchronous data fetching and state updates.

Mimir is an excellent choice for developers looking to implement a clean and efficient state management solution in their Flutter applications.

# Mimir Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the Mimir package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  mimir: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/mimir).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use Mimir in your application, you will typically create a state class that extends `MimirState`. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set up a state and a widget that uses it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mimir/mimir.dart';

class MyState extends MimirState {
  int counter = 0;

  void increment() {
    counter++;
    notifyListeners(); // Notify listeners to update the UI
  }
}

class MyCounterWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final state = Mimir.of<MyState>(context); // Access the state

    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Text('Counter: ${state.counter}'),
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: state.increment, // Increment the counter
          child: Text('Increment'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple counter application using Mimir for state management. The `MyState` class holds the counter value and provides a method to increment it. The `MyCounterWidget` listens for changes in the state and updates the UI accordingly.

# Complete Example of Mimir in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mimir/mimir.dart';

// Define the main function to run the app
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// Create the main application widget
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MimirProvider<MyState>(
      // Provide the state to the widget tree
      create: (context) => MyState(),
      child: MaterialApp(
        title: 'Mimir Example',
        home: MyHomePage(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Define the state class extending MimirState
class MyState extends MimirState {
  int counter = 0; // Initialize the counter

  // Method to increment the counter
  void increment() {
    counter++;
    notifyListeners(); // Notify listeners to update the UI
  }
}

// Create the home page widget
class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Mimir State Management'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: MyCounterWidget(), // Use the counter widget
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Create a widget to display and interact with the counter
class MyCounterWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final state = Mimir.of<MyState>(context); // Access the state

    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Text('Counter: ${state.counter}'), // Display the counter
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: state.increment, // Increment the counter
          child: Text('Increment'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp with MyApp.
2. MyApp uses MimirProvider to create and provide an instance of MyState to the widget tree.
3. MyHomePage is displayed as the home screen, which contains the MyCounterWidget.
4. MyCounterWidget accesses the state using Mimir.of<MyState>(context) to get the current counter value.
5. When the "Increment" button is pressed, the increment method in MyState is called, which updates the counter and notifies listeners.
6. The UI automatically updates to reflect the new counter value due to the reactive nature of Mimir.
