In summary, the code flows as follows:

*   The user runs the application and the Treemap widget is displayed.
*   The Treemap widget uses the data provided to it to render the hierarchical data.
*   The user can interact with the Treemap widget by zooming and panning.
*   The Treemap widget updates in real-time as the user interacts with it.

The Treemap package is a powerful tool for visualizing hierarchical data in a compact and interactive way. It is particularly useful for displaying large amounts of data in a limited space, making it an ideal choice for mobile and web applications.
