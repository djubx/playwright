# Setting Up Flame Markdown in Your Flutter Project

## Installation
To get started with the **flame_markdown** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml

  flame_markdown: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flame_markdown).

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` if you plan to load images from the internet. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the **flame_markdown** package, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flame_markdown/flame_markdown.dart';
```

You can then create a widget to render Markdown content:

```dart
Markdown(
  data: '# Hello, Markdown!\nThis is a simple example.',
)
```

This will render a header and a paragraph of text formatted in Markdown.
