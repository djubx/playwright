# Tutorial: Setting Up Stylish Pull to Refresh

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `stylish_pull_to_refresh` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `stylish_pull_to_refresh` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  stylish_pull_to_refresh: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install Packages

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `stylish_pull_to_refresh` in a `ListView`.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:stylish_pull_to_refresh/stylish_pull_to_refresh.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Stylish Pull to Refresh')),
        body: RefreshIndicator(
          onRefresh: _refreshData,
          child: ListView.builder(
            itemCount: 20,
            itemBuilder: (context, index) {
              return ListTile(title: Text('Item $index'));
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  Future<void> _refreshData() async {
    // Simulate a network call
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple `ListView` with a pull-to-refresh feature. The `_refreshData` method simulates a network call when the user pulls down to refresh.

# Complete Example of Stylish Pull to Refresh

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:stylish_pull_to_refresh/stylish_pull_to_refresh.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  List<String> items = List.generate(20, (index) => 'Item $index');

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Stylish Pull to Refresh')),
        body: StylishPullToRefresh(
          onRefresh: _refreshData, // Callback for refresh action
          child: ListView.builder(
            itemCount: items.length, // Number of items in the list
            itemBuilder: (context, index) {
              return ListTile(title: Text(items[index])); // Display each item
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  Future<void> _refreshData() async {
    // Simulate a network call
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));
    // Update the list with new data
    setState(() {
      items = List.generate(20, (index) => 'New Item $index');
    });
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains a list of items.
// 3. The build method creates a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a StylishPullToRefresh widget.
// 4. The StylishPullToRefresh widget wraps a ListView.builder, which displays the list of items.
// 5. When the user pulls down to refresh, the _refreshData method is called.
// 6. Inside _refreshData, we simulate a network call with a delay.
// 7. After the delay, we update the list of items and call setState to refresh the UI.
// 8. The ListView is rebuilt with the new items, providing a seamless refresh experience.
