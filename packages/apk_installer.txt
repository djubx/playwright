## Setup Process

To get started with the `apk_installer` package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the `apk_installer` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  apk_installer: ^latest_version
```

Replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/apk_installer).

### Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android

1. **Permissions**: Ensure that your Android app has the necessary permissions to install APKs. Add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
   ```

2. **Target SDK**: Make sure your `targetSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to 26 or higher to support APK installation.

#### iOS

Currently, the `apk_installer` package does not support iOS for APK installations, as iOS does not allow the installation of APK files. This package is primarily for Android applications.

### Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:apk_installer/apk_installer.dart';
```

## Using the Package

To use the `apk_installer` package, you can call the `installApk` method provided by the package. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
void installApk(String apkPath) async {
  try {
    await ApkInstaller.installApk(apkPath);
    print("APK installed successfully!");
  } catch (e) {
    print("Error installing APK: $e");
  }
}
```

This method takes the path of the APK file as a parameter and attempts to install it. If successful, it prints a success message; otherwise, it catches and prints the error.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:apk_installer/apk_installer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'APK Installer Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('APK Installer Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Define the path to the APK file
              String apkPath = '/path/to/your/apkfile.apk';
              installApk(apkPath);
            },
            child: Text('Install APK'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to install APK
  void installApk(String apkPath) async {
    try {
      // Attempt to install the APK
      await ApkInstaller.installApk(apkPath);
      // If successful, print a success message
      print("APK installed successfully!");
    } catch (e) {
      // If an error occurs, print the error message
      print("Error installing APK: $e");
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and displays a button labeled 'Install APK'.
// 2. When the button is pressed, the installApk function is called with the path to the APK file.
// 3. The installApk function attempts to install the APK using the ApkInstaller package.
// 4. If the installation is successful, a success message is printed to the console.
// 5. If an error occurs during installation, the error message is caught and printed.
```
