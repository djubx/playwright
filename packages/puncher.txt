# Puncher Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the Puncher package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  puncher: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/puncher).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, no additional configuration is typically required. Just ensure that your project is set up to support the latest iOS versions.

## Basic Usage
To use the Puncher package, wrap your widget with the `Puncher` widget. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:puncher/puncher.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Puncher Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Puncher(
          onTap: () {
            // Action to perform on tap
            print('Widget punched!');
          },
          child: Container(
            width: 100,
            height: 100,
            color: Colors.blue,
            child: Center(child: Text('Punch Me!', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white))),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the user taps the blue container, it will trigger the punch effect and print a message to the console.

With these steps, you can easily integrate the Puncher package into your Flutter application and start enhancing user interactions.

# Complete Example of Puncher in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:puncher/puncher.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Puncher Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Puncher Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Puncher(
          onTap: () {
            // Action to perform on tap
            print('Widget punched!');
          },
          child: Container(
            width: 100,
            height: 100,
            color: Colors.blue,
            child: Center(child: Text('Punch Me!', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white))),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Puncher widget wraps a Container.
// 5. The Container has a fixed size, a blue background, and displays the text "Punch Me!".
// 6. When the user taps the Container, the onTap callback of the Puncher widget is triggered.
// 7. This callback prints "Widget punched!" to the console, demonstrating the punch effect.
