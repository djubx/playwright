# flutter_native_text_view: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the `flutter_native_text_view` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_native_text_view: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_native_text_view).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
}
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions if you plan to load content from the internet:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `flutter_native_text_view` package, you can create a simple widget that displays rich text. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_native_text_view/flutter_native_text_view.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Native Text View Example')),
        body: NativeTextView(
          data: '<h1>Hello, Flutter!</h1><p>This is a <strong>native</strong> text view.</p>',
          isHtml: true, // Set to true if you're rendering HTML
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays a native text view with HTML content.

# Complete Example of flutter_native_text_view

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_native_text_view/flutter_native_text_view.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Native Text View Example')),
        body: NativeTextView(
          data: '<h1>Hello, Flutter!</h1><p>This is a <strong>native</strong> text view.</p>',
          isHtml: true, // Set to true if you're rendering HTML
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The runApp function takes the RealFlutter widget and starts the app.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 4. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Native Text View Example'.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains a NativeTextView widget.
// 6. The NativeTextView widget is initialized with HTML data.
// 7. The isHtml parameter is set to true, indicating that the data is HTML.
// 8. The app displays the rendered HTML content natively on the device.
```
