2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

3. Add the following to your `android/app/build.gradle` file under `android`:

```groovy
buildTypes {
    release {
        // Add your ProGuard rules here if needed
    }
}
```

### iOS

<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

3. Ensure that you have the latest iOS deployment target set in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage

To start using the **apptics_flutter** package, you need to initialize it in your main application file. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:apptics_flutter/apptics_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize Apptics with your API key
  Apptics.init('YOUR_API_KEY');
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Apptics Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Apptics Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Log a custom event
            Apptics.logEvent('Button Pressed');
          },
          child: Text('Press Me'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize the **apptics_flutter** package with an API key and log a custom event when a button is pressed.

# Complete Example of Apptics Flutter

Here is a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the **apptics_flutter** package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:apptics_flutter/apptics_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize Apptics with your API key
  Apptics.init('YOUR_API_KEY'); // Replace with your actual API key
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Apptics Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Apptics Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Log a custom event when the button is pressed
                Apptics.logEvent('Button Pressed');
              },
              child: Text('Press Me'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Log a screen view
                Apptics.logScreenView('Home Screen');
              },
              child: Text('View Home Screen'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Apptics SDK with the provided API key.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is the root of the application, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is displayed as the home screen of the app.
// 4. Two buttons are provided: 
//    - The first button logs a custom event when pressed.
//    - The second button logs a screen view when pressed.
// 5. This setup allows tracking user interactions and screen views for analytics purposes.
