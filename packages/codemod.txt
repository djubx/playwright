# Codemod Flutter Package: A Comprehensive Overview

The **codemod** package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers to facilitate code transformations and migrations. It allows developers to automate the process of modifying their codebase, making it easier to implement changes across multiple files or to upgrade to new versions of Flutter or dependencies.

## When to Use Codemod
- **Code Refactoring**: When you need to refactor large sections of your codebase, codemod can help automate repetitive changes.
- **Dependency Upgrades**: If you are upgrading dependencies that require changes in your code, codemod can streamline this process.
- **Codebase Migration**: When migrating from one architecture or state management solution to another, codemod can assist in making the necessary adjustments.

## Key Features
- **Automated Code Transformations**: Easily apply transformations to your codebase with minimal manual intervention.
- **Custom Scripts**: Create custom scripts to handle specific code modifications tailored to your project needs.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly across both Android and iOS platforms, ensuring consistent code changes.

With these features, codemod significantly reduces the time and effort required for code maintenance and upgrades, making it an essential tool for any Flutter developer.

# Codemod Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the codemod package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  codemod: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file is configured correctly. You may need to adjust the `minSdkVersion` and `targetSdkVersion` to meet the requirements of the codemod package.

### iOS
For iOS, check your `ios/Podfile` to ensure that you are using a compatible version of CocoaPods. You may need to run `pod install` after making changes to your dependencies.

## Basic Usage
Once installed, you can start using codemod in your project. Here’s a simple example of how to create a transformation script:

1. Create a new Dart file for your codemod script, e.g., `my_codemod.dart`.
2. Write your transformation logic using the codemod API.

Here’s a basic example of a codemod script that renames a class:

```dart
import 'package:codemod/codemod.dart';

void main() {
  // Define the transformation
  final transformer = Transformer(
    // Specify the files to transform
    files: ['lib/**/*.dart'],
    // Define the transformation logic
    transform: (String content) {
      return content.replaceAll('OldClassName', 'NewClassName');
    },
  );

  // Run the transformer
  transformer.run();
}
```

This script will search through all Dart files in the `lib` directory and replace occurrences of `OldClassName` with `NewClassName`.

# Complete Example of Using Codemod in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:codemod/codemod.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Codemod Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Codemod Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Trigger the codemod transformation when the button is pressed
              runCodemod();
            },
            child: Text('Run Codemod'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void runCodemod() {
    // Define the transformation
    final transformer = Transformer(
      files: ['lib/**/*.dart'],
      transform: (String content) {
        // Replace 'OldClassName' with 'NewClassName'
        return content.replaceAll('OldClassName', 'NewClassName');
      },
    );

    // Run the transformer
    transformer.run();
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'Codemod Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget with an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the runCodemod function is called.
// 6. The runCodemod function initializes a Transformer that looks for Dart files in the 'lib' directory.
// 7. The transformation logic replaces occurrences of 'OldClassName' with 'NewClassName'.
// 8. Finally, the transformer runs, applying the changes to the codebase.
```
