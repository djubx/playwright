```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart

```

## Step 5: Using the Package

You can now use the `PercentagesWithAnimation` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
PercentagesWithAnimation(
  percentage: 75, // The percentage to display
  duration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Animation duration
  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold), // Custom text style
),
```

This widget will animate from 0% to 75% over 2 seconds, displaying the percentage in a bold font.

# Complete Example of Using Percentages_with_animation

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:percentages_with_animation/percentages_with_animation.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Percentages with Animation Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Animated Percentage Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: PercentageDemo(), // Custom widget to show percentage
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class PercentageDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PercentageDemoState createState() => _PercentageDemoState();
}

class _PercentageDemoState extends State<PercentageDemo> {
  double _percentage = 0; // Initial percentage value

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Simulate a data loading process
    Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1), () {
      setState(() {
        _percentage = 75; // Update percentage after 1 second
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        // Animated percentage indicator
        PercentagesWithAnimation(
          percentage: _percentage, // Current percentage value
          duration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Animation duration
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 48, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold), // Text style
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between elements
        Text(
          'Loading...', // Additional text below the percentage
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a centered PercentageDemo widget.
// 3. PercentageDemo is a StatefulWidget that initializes a percentage value to 0.
// 4. In the initState method, a delayed future simulates loading data and updates the percentage to 75 after 1 second.
// 5. The build method returns a Column with the animated percentage indicator and a loading text.
// 6. The PercentagesWithAnimation widget animates the percentage from 0 to 75 over 2 seconds, providing a smooth visual transition.
