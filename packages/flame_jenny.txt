// The game starts by initializing the game loop, loading the game assets, and initializing the game state.
// The game loop updates the game state by changing the player's and enemy's positions.
// The game state is rendered by drawing the player's and enemy's sprites on the screen.
// The game continues to update and render the game state until the game is over.
