# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `body_part_selector`

## Installation
To get started with the `body_part_selector` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  body_part_selector: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/body_part_selector).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package
Once the package is installed, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the body part selector.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:body_part_selector/body_part_selector.dart';
```

2. Create a widget that utilizes the `BodyPartSelector`:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Body Part Selector Example')),
      body: BodyPartSelector(
        onPartSelected: (selectedPart) {
          // Handle the selected body part
          print('Selected Body Part: $selectedPart');
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This simple setup will create a body part selector that prints the selected part to the console.

# Complete Example of `body_part_selector`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:body_part_selector/body_part_selector.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Body Part Selector Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Body Part Selector Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: BodyPartSelector(
          onPartSelected: (selectedPart) {
            // This callback is triggered when a body part is selected
            // Here we can handle the selected body part
            print('Selected Body Part: $selectedPart');
            // You can also show a dialog or navigate to another screen based on the selection
            showDialog(
              context: context,
              builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                title: Text('Body Part Selected'),
                content: Text('You selected: $selectedPart'),
                actions: [
                  TextButton(
                    onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                    child: Text('OK'),
                  ),
                ],
              ),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme, and specifies RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a BodyPartSelector widget in the center.
// 4. When a user selects a body part, the onPartSelected callback is triggered.
// 5. The selected body part is printed to the console and an AlertDialog is shown with the selected part.
// 6. The user can dismiss the dialog by pressing the 'OK' button, which closes the dialog.
