# Tutorial: Setting Up the YouTube Flutter Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the YouTube Flutter package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the YouTube package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  youtube_player_flutter: ^8.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 16:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 16
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following key to allow network access:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to embed a YouTube video.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:youtube_player_flutter/youtube_player_flutter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late YoutubePlayerController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the YoutubePlayerController with a video ID
    _controller = YoutubePlayerController(
      initialVideoId: 'dQw4w9WgXcQ', // Replace with your video ID
      flags: YoutubePlayerFlags(
        autoPlay: true,
        loop: true,
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose the controller when the widget is removed from the widget tree
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('YouTube Player Example'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Display the YouTube player
          YoutubePlayer(
            controller: _controller,
            showVideoProgressIndicator: true,
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that plays a YouTube video using the `YoutubePlayerController`. The video ID is specified in the controller's initialization.

# Complete Example: YouTube Player in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:youtube_player_flutter/youtube_player_flutter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late YoutubePlayerController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the YoutubePlayerController with a video ID
    _controller = YoutubePlayerController(
      initialVideoId: 'dQw4w9WgXcQ', // Replace with your video ID
      flags: YoutubePlayerFlags(
        autoPlay: true, // Automatically play the video
        loop: true, // Loop the video
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose the controller when the widget is removed from the widget tree
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('YouTube Player Example'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Display the YouTube player
          YoutubePlayer(
            controller: _controller, // Pass the controller to the player
            showVideoProgressIndicator: true, // Show progress indicator
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 2. In the initState method, we initialize the YoutubePlayerController with a specific video ID.
// 3. The controller is configured to autoplay and loop the video.
// 4. In the build method, we create a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body that contains the YoutubePlayer widget.
// 5. The YoutubePlayer widget takes the controller as a parameter and displays the video.
// 6. When the widget is disposed, we ensure to dispose of the controller to free up resources.
```
