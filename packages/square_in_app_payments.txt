# Tutorial: Setting Up Square In-App Payments

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **square_in_app_payments** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the **square_in_app_payments** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  square_in_app_payments: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Add the following permissions and metadata to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<manifest>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
    <application>
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.squareup.sdk.inapp_payments.api_key"
            android:value="YOUR_SQUARE_API_KEY"/>
    </application>
</manifest>
```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure that your `build.gradle` file includes the necessary dependencies:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.squareup.sdk.inapp_payments:in-app-payments:latest_version'
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
<key>SquareInAppPaymentsSDK</key>
<dict>
    <key>APIKey</key>
    <string>YOUR_SQUARE_API_KEY</string>
</dict>
```

2. **CocoaPods**: Ensure you have the necessary CocoaPods installed. Run the following command in your iOS directory:

```bash
pod install
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have configured the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement payment processing.

# Complete Example of Square In-App Payments

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:square_in_app_payments/square_in_app_payments.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Square In-App Payments Demo',
      home: PaymentScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PaymentScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PaymentScreenState createState() => _PaymentScreenState();
}

class _PaymentScreenState extends State<PaymentScreen> {
  // Initialize Square In-App Payments
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    SquareInAppPayments.init('YOUR_SQUARE_APPLICATION_ID');
  }

  // Function to handle payment
  void _handlePayment() async {
    try {
      // Create a payment request
      final result = await SquareInAppPayments.requestPayment(
        amount: 1000, // Amount in cents
        currency: 'USD',
        note: 'Payment for services',
      );

      // Handle successful payment
      if (result != null) {
        // Payment was successful
        ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
          SnackBar(content: Text('Payment Successful: ${result.id}')),
        );
      }
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle payment error
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Payment Failed: $e')),
      );
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Square Payment')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _handlePayment,
          child: Text('Pay Now'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The PaymentScreen widget is displayed, initializing Square In-App Payments with the application ID.
// 3. When the user taps the "Pay Now" button, the _handlePayment function is called.
// 4. This function requests a payment of $10.00 (1000 cents) and handles the response.
// 5. If the payment is successful, a success message is shown; otherwise, an error message is displayed.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we demonstrated how to set up and use the **square_in_app_payments** package in a Flutter application. The application initializes the Square payment SDK, requests a payment when the user taps the button, and handles both success and error responses. This flow ensures a smooth user experience while processing payments securely.
