# Setting Up the Checkmark Package in Flutter

Integrating the `checkmark` package into your Flutter project is straightforward. This section will guide you through the setup process and demonstrate how to use the package effectively.

## Installation

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `checkmark` package under dependencies.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     checkmark: ^1.0.0
   ```

2. **Install Package**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the package.

   ```

## Platform-Specific Setup

### Android

No additional setup is required for Android. The package works seamlessly with the default Flutter Android setup.

### iOS

Ensure that your iOS deployment target is set to at least iOS 9.0. You can set this in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
```

## Using the Checkmark Package

To use the `checkmark` package, you need to import it into your Dart file and utilize the `RealFlutter` class to create and display checkmarks.

```dart
import 'package:checkmark/checkmark.dart';

// Example usage
RealFlutter(
  size: 50.0,
  color: Colors.green,
  duration: Duration(seconds: 1),
);
```

### Customization Options

- **Size**: Adjust the size of the checkmark.
- **Color**: Change the color to match your app's theme.
- **Duration**: Set the duration of the animation.

# Complete Example: Flutter Main File

Below is a complete example demonstrating how to use the `checkmark` package in a Flutter application.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:checkmark/checkmark.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Checkmark Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: CheckmarkDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class CheckmarkDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CheckmarkDemoState createState() => _CheckmarkDemoState();
}

class _CheckmarkDemoState extends State<CheckmarkDemo> {
  bool _showCheckmark = false;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Checkmark Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Conditionally display the checkmark
            if (_showCheckmark)
              RealFlutter(
                size: 100.0,
                color: Colors.green,
                duration: Duration(seconds: 1),
              ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Toggle the checkmark visibility
                setState(() {
                  _showCheckmark = !_showCheckmark;
                });
              },
              child: Text(_showCheckmark ? 'Hide Checkmark' : 'Show Checkmark'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// MyApp is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// The home property of MaterialApp is set to CheckmarkDemo, a StatefulWidget.
// CheckmarkDemo manages the state of the checkmark visibility using a boolean _showCheckmark.
// The build method of _CheckmarkDemoState returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to layout the checkmark and a button.
// The RealFlutter widget is conditionally displayed based on the _showCheckmark boolean.
// An ElevatedButton is provided to toggle the visibility of the checkmark by updating the state.
