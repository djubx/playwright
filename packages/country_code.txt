# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Country Code Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `country_code` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  country_code: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you are accessing location services or other sensitive data. However, for basic usage of the `country_code` package, no additional configuration is required.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to retrieve and display country codes.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:country_code/country_code.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Country Code Example'),
        ),
        body: CountryCodeList(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class CountryCodeList extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Fetching the list of country codes
    final countryCodes = CountryCode.getAllCountryCodes();

    return ListView.builder(
      itemCount: countryCodes.length,
      itemBuilder: (context, index) {
        return ListTile(
          title: Text(countryCodes[index].name),
          subtitle: Text(countryCodes[index].code),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays a list of country names along with their corresponding codes.

# Complete Example of the Country Code Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:country_code/country_code.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Country Code Example'),
        ),
        body: CountryCodeList(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class CountryCodeList extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Fetching the list of country codes
    final countryCodes = CountryCode.getAllCountryCodes();

    return ListView.builder(
      itemCount: countryCodes.length,
      itemBuilder: (context, index) {
        return ListTile(
          title: Text(countryCodes[index].name), // Display country name
          subtitle: Text(countryCodes[index].code), // Display country code
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with RealFlutter as the root widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a body.
// 3. The body of the Scaffold is a CountryCodeList widget, which is responsible for displaying the list of country codes.
// 4. In the CountryCodeList widget, we call CountryCode.getAllCountryCodes() to retrieve a list of all available country codes.
// 5. We use a ListView.builder to create a scrollable list of ListTile widgets, each displaying the name and code of a country.
// 6. The ListTile's title shows the country name, and the subtitle shows the corresponding country code, providing a clear and organized display of information.
