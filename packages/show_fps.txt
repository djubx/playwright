# Overview of the show_fps Flutter Package

The `show_fps` package is a Flutter plugin designed to help developers monitor the frames per second (FPS) of their applications in real-time. This package is particularly useful for performance optimization, allowing developers to identify bottlenecks and ensure smooth animations and transitions.

## When to Use `show_fps`

- **Performance Monitoring**: Use this package when you want to keep track of your app's performance during development and testing phases.
- **Animation Optimization**: If your app relies heavily on animations, monitoring FPS can help you fine-tune them for a smoother user experience.
- **Debugging**: When you encounter performance issues, the FPS data can provide insights into whether the app is rendering frames efficiently.

## Features

- **Real-time FPS Display**: The package overlays the current FPS on the app's UI, providing immediate feedback.
- **Customizable Appearance**: You can customize the position, color, and size of the FPS display to fit your app's design.
- **Platform Compatibility**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

By integrating `show_fps`, developers can gain valuable insights into their app's performance, leading to better optimization and user experience.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using show_fps

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `show_fps` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  show_fps: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:show_fps/show_fps.dart';
```

## Step 3: Initializing the FPS Display

You need to initialize the FPS display in your main widget. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
  ShowFps.start(); // Start showing FPS
}
```

## Step 4: Customizing the FPS Display

You can customize the FPS display by passing parameters to the `ShowFps` widget. For example:

```dart
ShowFps(
  color: Colors.green, // Change the color of the FPS text
  fontSize: 20, // Set the font size
  position: FpsPosition.topRight, // Position the FPS display
)
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` if your app requires specific capabilities. However, for basic FPS monitoring, no additional configurations are typically required.

## Step 5: Running Your App

After setting everything up, run your app using:

```bash
flutter run
```

You should see the FPS displayed on your app's UI, allowing you to monitor performance in real-time.

# Complete Example of Using show_fps

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:show_fps/show_fps.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
  ShowFps.start(); // Start showing FPS
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'FPS Monitor Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('FPS Monitor'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text(
                'Watch the FPS in the top right corner!',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Simulate a heavy task
                  for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
                    // This loop is just to simulate workload
                  }
                },
                child: Text('Simulate Load'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
        floatingActionButton: ShowFps(
          color: Colors.green, // Customize FPS display color
          fontSize: 20, // Customize FPS display font size
          position: FpsPosition.topRight, // Position of the FPS display
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and starts the FPS monitoring.
// 2. The RealFlutter class builds the main UI, which includes an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the text and button vertically.
// 4. The button simulates a heavy task when pressed, which can affect the FPS.
// 5. The ShowFps widget is used to display the current FPS in the top right corner of the screen.
// 6. The FPS display is customizable in terms of color, font size, and position.
