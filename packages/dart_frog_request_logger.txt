# Setting Up and Using Dart Frog Request Logger

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `dart_frog_request_logger` package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `dart_frog_request_logger` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dart_frog_request_logger: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to access the internet. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following line inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` file to allow arbitrary loads if you are testing with non-HTTPS endpoints. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to integrate the `dart_frog_request_logger` into your app.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:dart_frog_request_logger/dart_frog_request_logger.dart';
```

2. Initialize the logger in your main application file:

```dart
void main() {
  // Initialize the logger
  final logger = RequestLogger();
  
  // Start your application
  runApp(MyApp(logger: logger));
}
```

3. Use the logger in your HTTP requests:

```dart
final response = await logger.get('https://api.example.com/data');
```

By following these steps, you can effectively set up and utilize the `dart_frog_request_logger` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Dart Frog Request Logger

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dart_frog_request_logger/dart_frog_request_logger.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the logger
  final logger = RequestLogger();
  
  // Start the Flutter application
  runApp(MyApp(logger: logger));
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  final RequestLogger logger;

  MyApp({required this.logger});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dart Frog Request Logger Example',
      home: HomeScreen(logger: logger),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  final RequestLogger logger;

  HomeScreen({required this.logger});

  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  String _responseData = '';

  // Function to fetch data from the API
  Future<void> _fetchData() async {
    try {
      // Log the request and get the response
      final response = await widget.logger.get('https://api.example.com/data');
      
      // Update the state with the response data
      setState(() {
        _responseData = response.body; // Assuming the response body is a String
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during the request
      setState(() {
        _responseData = 'Error: $e';
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Dart Frog Request Logger Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Response Data:'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(_responseData),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _fetchData, // Fetch data when button is pressed
              child: Text('Fetch Data'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the RequestLogger and starts the Flutter app.
// 2. MyApp is the root widget that takes the logger as a parameter.
// 3. HomeScreen is a stateful widget that displays the response data and a button to fetch data.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the _fetchData function is called.
// 5. _fetchData uses the logger to make a GET request to the specified API endpoint.
// 6. The response data is then displayed on the screen, or an error message is shown if the request fails.
```
