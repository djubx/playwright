Here's a detailed technical blog on the "whiteboard" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Whiteboard Flutter Package

The **Whiteboard** Flutter package is a versatile tool designed for creating interactive whiteboard applications. It allows developers to implement drawing functionalities, making it ideal for educational apps, collaborative tools, and creative applications. With features like freehand drawing, shape creation, and text annotations, the Whiteboard package provides a comprehensive solution for building engaging user interfaces.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the Whiteboard package in scenarios such as:
- **Educational Apps**: Where students can draw or annotate on a shared canvas.
- **Collaborative Tools**: For teams to brainstorm and visualize ideas in real-time.
- **Creative Applications**: Allowing users to sketch or illustrate concepts directly within the app.

## Key Features
- **Freehand Drawing**: Users can draw freely on the canvas with customizable brush sizes and colors.
- **Shape Tools**: Options to add geometric shapes like circles, rectangles, and lines.
- **Text Annotations**: Users can add text to the canvas for better explanations.
- **Undo/Redo Functionality**: Users can easily revert or reapply their actions.
- **Export Options**: Save the whiteboard content as images or share it directly.

The Whiteboard package is a powerful addition to any Flutter developer's toolkit, enabling the creation of rich, interactive applications with minimal effort.

# Tutorial: Setting Up the Whiteboard Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the Whiteboard package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the Whiteboard package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  whiteboard: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/whiteboard).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file, especially if you plan to use features that require camera or microphone access.

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the camera for drawing features.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the microphone for audio annotations.</string>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple whiteboard application. Below is a basic implementation.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:whiteboard/whiteboard.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Whiteboard Example',
      home: WhiteboardPage(),
    );
  }
}

class WhiteboardPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _WhiteboardPageState createState() => _WhiteboardPageState();
}

class _WhiteboardPageState extends State<WhiteboardPage> {
  // Initialize the whiteboard controller
  final WhiteboardController _controller = WhiteboardController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Whiteboard'),
        actions: [
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.undo),
            onPressed: () {
              _controller.undo(); // Undo the last action
            },
          ),
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.redo),
            onPressed: () {
              _controller.redo(); // Redo the last undone action
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
      body: Whiteboard(
        controller: _controller, // Attach the controller to the whiteboard
        backgroundColor: Colors.white, // Set the background color
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this code, we create a simple Flutter application with a whiteboard. The `Whiteboard` widget is used to display the drawing area, and we provide undo and redo functionality through the app bar.

# Complete Example of a Whiteboard Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:whiteboard/whiteboard.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Whiteboard Example',
      home: WhiteboardPage(),
    );
  }
}

class WhiteboardPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _WhiteboardPageState createState() => _WhiteboardPageState();
}

class _WhiteboardPageState extends State<WhiteboardPage> {
  // Initialize the whiteboard controller
  final WhiteboardController _controller = WhiteboardController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Whiteboard'),
        actions: [
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.undo),
            onPressed: () {
              _controller.undo(); // Undo the last action
            },
          ),
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.redo),
            onPressed: () {
              _controller.redo(); // Redo the last undone action
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
      body: Whiteboard(
        controller: _controller, // Attach the controller to the whiteboard
        backgroundColor: Colors.white, // Set the background color
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets WhiteboardPage as the home.
// 3. WhiteboardPage is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the whiteboard.
// 4. The _WhiteboardPageState class initializes a WhiteboardController to manage drawing actions.
// 5. The Scaffold widget provides a structure with an AppBar and a body.
// 6. The AppBar contains buttons for undoing and redoing actions on the whiteboard.
// 7. The body contains the Whiteboard widget, which displays the drawing area and allows user interactions.
// 8. Users can draw on the whiteboard, and the app provides functionality to undo and redo their actions.
```

In summary, this blog provided a comprehensive overview of the Whiteboard Flutter package, including its features, setup instructions, and a complete example application. The application allows users to draw on a whiteboard, with undo and redo functionalities, making it a great starting point for building interactive applications.
