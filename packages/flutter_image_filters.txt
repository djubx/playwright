# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_image_filters

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_image_filters` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_image_filters` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_image_filters: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_image_filters).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add permissions for accessing the photo library in your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to the photo library.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in our Flutter application. Below, we will create a simple app that allows users to select an image and apply filters to it.

# Complete Example: Flutter Image Filters

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_image_filters/flutter_image_filters.dart';
import 'package:image_picker/image_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Image Filters Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: ImageFilterHome(),
    );
  }
}

class ImageFilterHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ImageFilterHomeState createState() => _ImageFilterHomeState();
}

class _ImageFilterHomeState extends State<ImageFilterHome> {
  // Variable to hold the selected image
  Image? _image;
  // Variable to hold the selected filter
  ImageFilter? _selectedFilter;

  // Function to pick an image from the gallery
  Future<void> _pickImage() async {
    final picker = ImagePicker();
    final pickedFile = await picker.getImage(source: ImageSource.gallery);
    
    if (pickedFile != null) {
      setState(() {
        // Load the selected image
        _image = Image.file(File(pickedFile.path));
      });
    }
  }

  // Function to apply the selected filter
  Widget _applyFilter() {
    if (_image != null && _selectedFilter != null) {
      return ImageFiltered(
        imageFilter: _selectedFilter!,
        child: _image!,
      );
    }
    return _image ?? Container(); // Return the image or an empty container
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Image Filters'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the filtered image
            _applyFilter(),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to pick an image
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _pickImage,
              child: Text('Pick Image'),
            ),
            // Dropdown to select a filter
            DropdownButton<ImageFilter>(
              hint: Text('Select Filter'),
              value: _selectedFilter,
              onChanged: (ImageFilter? newValue) {
                setState(() {
                  _selectedFilter = newValue; // Update the selected filter
                });
              },
              items: [
                DropdownMenuItem(
                  child: Text('Blur'),
                  value: ImageFilter.blur(sigmaX: 5.0, sigmaY: 5.0),
                ),
                DropdownMenuItem(
                  child: Text('Brightness'),
                  value: ImageFilter.matrix(<double>[
                    1, 0, 0, 0, 50, // Increase brightness
                    0, 1, 0, 0, 50,
                    0, 0, 1, 0, 50,
                    0, 0, 0, 1, 0,
                  ]),
                ),
                // Add more filters as needed
              ],
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds the MaterialApp and sets the home to ImageFilterHome.
// 3. ImageFilterHome is a stateful widget that manages the selected image and filter.
// 4. The _pickImage function allows users to select an image from their gallery.
// 5. The _applyFilter function applies the selected filter to the image if available.
// 6. The UI consists of a button to pick an image and a dropdown to select a filter.
// 7. When an image is picked, it is displayed, and the selected filter is applied dynamically.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application that allows users to pick an image from their gallery and apply various filters to it. The application flow is straightforward: it starts with the main function, builds the UI, and allows users to interact with the image and filters. The comments within the code provide a step-by-step explanation of how the application works, making it easy to understand and extend.
