# Complete Example: Using the Genius Lyrics Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:genius_lyrics/genius_lyrics.dart'; // Import the genius_lyrics package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Genius Lyrics Example',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: LyricsPage(), // Set the home page to LyricsPage
    );
  }
}

class LyricsPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _LyricsPageState createState() => _LyricsPageState();
}

class _LyricsPageState extends State<LyricsPage> {
  String _lyrics = ''; // Variable to hold the fetched lyrics
  final String _accessToken = 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'; // Replace with your Genius API access token

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _fetchLyrics(); // Fetch lyrics when the widget is initialized
  }

  // Function to fetch lyrics from Genius API
  Future<void> _fetchLyrics() async {
    final genius = GeniusLyrics(accessToken: _accessToken); // Create an instance of GeniusLyrics
    final song = await genius.searchSong('Song Title', 'Artist Name'); // Search for the song
    if (song != null) {
      final lyrics = await genius.getLyrics(song.id); // Get the lyrics for the song
      setState(() {
        _lyrics = lyrics; // Update the state with the fetched lyrics
      });
    } else {
      setState(() {
        _lyrics = 'Lyrics not found'; // Handle case where lyrics are not found
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Lyrics')),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: SingleChildScrollView(
          child: Column(
            children: [
              Text(
                _lyrics.isNotEmpty ? _lyrics : 'Loading lyrics...',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
              ), // Display the fetched lyrics or loading message
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme, and the home page is set to LyricsPage.
// 3. In LyricsPage, the _fetchLyrics function is called in initState to fetch lyrics when the page loads.
// 4. The _fetchLyrics function creates an instance of GeniusLyrics with the access token, searches for a specific song, and retrieves its lyrics.
// 5. If the lyrics are found, they are displayed on the screen; otherwise, a "Lyrics not found" message is shown.
```
