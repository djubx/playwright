# Overview of the `widget_event` Flutter Package

The `widget_event` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that simplifies the management of events within widgets. It allows developers to create responsive and interactive applications by handling user interactions and widget state changes efficiently. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple widgets need to communicate or respond to events, such as in complex forms, dashboards, or games.

## When to Use `widget_event`

- **Complex User Interfaces**: When building applications with intricate UI components that require real-time updates based on user actions.
- **State Management**: When you need a lightweight solution for managing state across multiple widgets without relying on heavier state management solutions like Provider or Bloc.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: When implementing an event-driven architecture where widgets need to react to specific events triggered by user actions or other widgets.

## Key Features

- **Event Handling**: Easily define and listen for events within your widgets.
- **Decoupled Architecture**: Promotes a clean separation of concerns by decoupling event producers from consumers.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead, making it suitable for performance-sensitive applications.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

By leveraging the `widget_event` package, developers can create more maintainable and scalable Flutter applications that respond dynamically to user interactions.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the `widget_event` Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `widget_event` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `widget_event` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  widget_event: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # Ensure this is set to at least 10.0
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in a Flutter application.

1. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the `widget_event` package.

   ```dart
   import 'package:widget_event/widget_event.dart';
   ```

2. **Create an Event Class**: Define an event class that extends `WidgetEvent`.

   ```dart
   class MyCustomEvent extends WidgetEvent {
     final String message;

     MyCustomEvent(this.message);
   }
   ```

3. **Listen for Events**: Use the `WidgetEventListener` to listen for events in your widgets.

   ```dart
   WidgetEventListener(
     onEvent: (event) {
       if (event is MyCustomEvent) {
         print(event.message);
       }
     },
     child: YourWidget(),
   );
   ```

4. **Trigger Events**: Use the `WidgetEventDispatcher` to dispatch events from your widgets.

   ```dart
   WidgetEventDispatcher.dispatch(MyCustomEvent("Hello from the widget!"));
   ```

By following these steps, you can effectively integrate the `widget_event` package into your Flutter application, enabling dynamic event handling and communication between widgets.

# Complete Example of Using the `widget_event` Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:widget_event/widget_event.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Widget Event Example',
      home: EventDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class EventDemo extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Widget Event Demo'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: [
          // Widget to listen for events
          WidgetEventListener(
            onEvent: (event) {
              if (event is MyCustomEvent) {
                // Print the message from the event
                print(event.message);
              }
            },
            child: ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Dispatch an event when the button is pressed
                WidgetEventDispatcher.dispatch(MyCustomEvent("Button Pressed!"));
              },
              child: Text('Press Me'),
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (EventDemo).
// 3. The EventDemo widget creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Column containing a button.
// 4. The WidgetEventListener listens for MyCustomEvent events.
// 5. When the button is pressed, it dispatches a MyCustomEvent with a message.
// 6. The listener captures the event and prints the message to the console.
