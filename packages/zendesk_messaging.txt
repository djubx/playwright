# Tutorial: Setting Up the Zendesk Messaging Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `zendesk_messaging` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `zendesk_messaging` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  zendesk_messaging: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the required permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.yourapp">

    <application
        ...
        android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"> <!-- Allow cleartext traffic for testing -->
        ...
    </application>

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
</manifest>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. Ensure you have the required permissions in your `Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires location access to provide better support.</string>
```

## Step 3: Initialize the Package

In your main Dart file, initialize the `zendesk_messaging` package. You will need to provide your Zendesk account credentials.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:zendesk_messaging/zendesk_messaging.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Zendesk Messaging Demo',
      home: ChatScreen(),
    );
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Implement the Chat Screen

Create a chat screen that utilizes the `zendesk_messaging` package to display the chat interface.

```dart
class ChatScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ChatScreenState createState() => _ChatScreenState();
}

class _ChatScreenState extends State<ChatScreen> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize Zendesk Messaging
    ZendeskMessaging.initialize(
      accountKey: 'YOUR_ZENDESK_ACCOUNT_KEY',
      appId: 'YOUR_ZENDESK_APP_ID',
      userId: 'USER_ID', // Optional: Set user ID for tracking
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Chat with Support'),
      ),
      body: ZendeskMessagingWidget(), // Display the chat widget
    );
  }
}
```

Now, you have successfully set up the `zendesk_messaging` package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Zendesk Messaging in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:zendesk_messaging/zendesk_messaging.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Zendesk Messaging Demo',
      home: ChatScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ChatScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ChatScreenState createState() => _ChatScreenState();
}

class _ChatScreenState extends State<ChatScreen> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize Zendesk Messaging with your credentials
    ZendeskMessaging.initialize(
      accountKey: 'YOUR_ZENDESK_ACCOUNT_KEY', // Replace with your Zendesk account key
      appId: 'YOUR_ZENDESK_APP_ID', // Replace with your Zendesk app ID
      userId: 'USER_ID', // Optional: Set user ID for tracking
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Chat with Support'), // Title of the chat screen
      ),
      body: ZendeskMessagingWidget(), // Display the chat widget
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget, which is the root of the application.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets ChatScreen as the home widget.
// 3. ChatScreen is a StatefulWidget that initializes the Zendesk Messaging package in its initState method.
// 4. The ZendeskMessaging.initialize method is called with the required credentials to set up the messaging service.
// 5. The build method of ChatScreen returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and the ZendeskMessagingWidget, which displays the chat interface.
// 6. Users can now interact with the chat interface to communicate with customer support.
