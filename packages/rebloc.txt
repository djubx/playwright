# Exploring the rebloc Flutter Package

The **rebloc** package is a state management solution for Flutter applications that follows the Redux pattern. It provides a way to manage application state in a predictable manner, making it easier to build complex applications with a clear separation of concerns. 

## When to Use rebloc
You might consider using rebloc when:
- You are building a large-scale application that requires a robust state management solution.
- You want to maintain a clear and predictable state flow in your application.
- You prefer a functional programming approach to managing state.

## Key Features
- **Redux-inspired Architecture**: rebloc is inspired by the Redux pattern, which allows for a unidirectional data flow.
- **Separation of Concerns**: It encourages separating your business logic from UI code, making your application easier to maintain and test.
- **Immutable State**: The state in rebloc is immutable, which helps in tracking changes and debugging.
- **Middleware Support**: You can add middleware to handle side effects, logging, or asynchronous actions.

Overall, rebloc is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to implement a structured state management solution.

# Setting Up and Using rebloc

## Installation
To get started with rebloc, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  rebloc: ^0.5.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Basic Configuration
### Android
No specific configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 9.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
```

## Using rebloc
1. **Define Your State**: Create a class that represents your application state.
2. **Create Actions**: Define actions that will modify the state.
3. **Create a Reducer**: Write a function that takes the current state and an action, returning a new state.
4. **Set Up the Store**: Create a store that holds the state and allows dispatching actions.
5. **Connect Your Widgets**: Use `BlocBuilder` to connect your UI to the state.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set up rebloc in your Flutter application:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:rebloc/rebloc.dart';

// Step 1: Define your application state
class AppState {
  final int counter;

  AppState({this.counter = 0});
}

// Step 2: Define actions
class IncrementAction {}
class DecrementAction {}

// Step 3: Create a reducer
AppState appReducer(AppState state, dynamic action) {
  if (action is IncrementAction) {
    return AppState(counter: state.counter + 1);
  } else if (action is DecrementAction) {
    return AppState(counter: state.counter - 1);
  }
  return state;
}

// Step 4: Set up the store
class MyStore extends Store<AppState> {
  MyStore() : super(appReducer, initialState: AppState());
}

// Step 5: Connect your widgets
class CounterWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return BlocBuilder<AppState>(
      builder: (context, state) {
        return Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Counter: ${state.counter}'),
            Row(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              children: [
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () => context.dispatch(IncrementAction()),
                  child: Text('Increment'),
                ),
                SizedBox(width: 20),
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () => context.dispatch(DecrementAction()),
                  child: Text('Decrement'),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ],
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

// Main application widget
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return StoreProvider<MyStore>(
      store: MyStore(),
      child: MaterialApp(
        home: Scaffold(
          appBar: AppBar(title: Text('rebloc Example')),
          body: Center(child: CounterWidget()),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This setup provides a simple counter application using rebloc for state management.

# Complete Example of rebloc in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:rebloc/rebloc.dart';

// Step 1: Define your application state
class AppState {
  final int counter;

  AppState({this.counter = 0});
}

// Step 2: Define actions
class IncrementAction {}
class DecrementAction {}

// Step 3: Create a reducer
AppState appReducer(AppState state, dynamic action) {
  if (action is IncrementAction) {
    return AppState(counter: state.counter + 1); // Increment the counter
  } else if (action is DecrementAction) {
    return AppState(counter: state.counter - 1); // Decrement the counter
  }
  return state; // Return the current state if no action matches
}

// Step 4: Set up the store
class MyStore extends Store<AppState> {
  MyStore() : super(appReducer, initialState: AppState());
}

// Step 5: Connect your widgets
class CounterWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return BlocBuilder<AppState>(
      builder: (context, state) {
        return Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Counter: ${state.counter}'), // Display the current counter value
            Row(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              children: [
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () => context.dispatch(IncrementAction()), // Dispatch increment action
                  child: Text('Increment'),
                ),
                SizedBox(width: 20),
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () => context.dispatch(DecrementAction()), // Dispatch decrement action
                  child: Text('Decrement'),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ],
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

// Main application widget
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return StoreProvider<MyStore>(
      store: MyStore(), // Provide the store to the widget tree
      child: MaterialApp(
        home: Scaffold(
          appBar: AppBar(title: Text('rebloc Example')), // App bar title
          body: Center(child: CounterWidget()), // Center the counter widget
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget sets up the StoreProvider, providing the MyStore instance to the widget tree.
3. The CounterWidget is built, which uses BlocBuilder to listen for changes in the AppState.
4. When the Increment or Decrement button is pressed, an action is dispatched to the store.
5. The store processes the action through the appReducer, updating the state accordingly.
6. The BlocBuilder rebuilds the CounterWidget with the new state, displaying the updated counter value.
