flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to allow video playback:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:video_player/video_player.dart';

# Complete Example of Using the Video Player Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:video_player/video_player.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late VideoPlayerController _controller; // Declare a VideoPlayerController
  late Future<void> _initializeVideoPlayerFuture; // Future to manage video initialization

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the VideoPlayerController with a video URL
    _controller = VideoPlayerController.network(
      'https://www.example.com/video.mp4', // Replace with your video URL
    );

    // Initialize the controller and store the Future for later use
    _initializeVideoPlayerFuture = _controller.initialize();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the controller when the widget is disposed
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Video Player Example'), // App title
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: FutureBuilder(
            // Use FutureBuilder to wait for the video to initialize
            future: _initializeVideoPlayerFuture,
            builder: (context, snapshot) {
              if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.done) {
                // If the video is initialized, display the video player
                return AspectRatio(
                  aspectRatio: _controller.value.aspectRatio, // Maintain aspect ratio
                  child: VideoPlayer(_controller), // Create the VideoPlayer widget
                );
              } else {
                // If the video is still loading, show a loading spinner
                return CircularProgressIndicator();
              }
            },
          ),
        ),
        floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Toggle play/pause when the button is pressed
            setState(() {
              _controller.value.isPlaying
                  ? _controller.pause() // Pause if currently playing
                  : _controller.play(); // Play if currently paused
            });
          },
          child: Icon(
            _controller.value.isPlaying ? Icons.pause : Icons.play_arrow, // Change icon based on state
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget, a VideoPlayerController is created to manage video playback.
// 3. The video is initialized in the initState method, and a Future is stored for later use.
// 4. The build method uses a FutureBuilder to wait for the video to initialize before displaying it.
// 5. If the video is ready, it shows the video player; otherwise, it displays a loading spinner.
// 6. A FloatingActionButton is provided to toggle play and pause functionality for the video.
