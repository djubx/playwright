# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:share_files_and_screenshot_widgets/share_files_and_screenshot_widgets.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Share Files and Screenshot Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  // Function to capture a screenshot of the widget
  Future<void> _captureAndShareScreenshot(BuildContext context) async {
    try {
      // Capture the screenshot of the entire screen
      final image = await ShareFilesAndScreenshotWidgets.capture(
        pixelRatio: 3.0, // Set the pixel ratio for better quality
        widget: RepaintBoundary(
          child: Container(
            color: Colors.white,
            child: Column(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              children: [
                Text('Hello, Flutter!', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24)),
                SizedBox(height: 20),
                Image.asset('assets/sample_image.png'), // Example image
              ],
            ),
          ),
        ),
      );

      // Share the captured image
      await ShareFilesAndScreenshotWidgets.share(
        image.path,
        'Check out this screenshot!',
      );
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during screenshot capture or sharing
      print('Error: $e');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Share Files and Screenshot Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () => _captureAndShareScreenshot(context),
          child: Text('Capture and Share Screenshot'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget contains a button that, when pressed, triggers the _captureAndShareScreenshot function.
// 4. Inside this function, a screenshot of the specified widget is captured using the capture method.
// 5. The captured image is then shared using the share method, allowing users to send it via their preferred sharing options.
// 6. Any errors during the process are caught and printed to the console for debugging.
```
