# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Access Wallpaper Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `access_wallpaper` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `access_wallpaper` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  access_wallpaper: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open `AndroidManifest.xml` located in `android/app/src/main/` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SET_WALLPAPER"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
   ```

2. **Minimum SDK Version**: Ensure your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open `Info.plist` located in `ios/Runner/` and add the following key to request permission to access the photo library:

   ```xml
   <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
   <string>This app requires access to your photo library to set wallpapers.</string>
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to set and get wallpapers.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:access_wallpaper/access_wallpaper.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Wallpaper App')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Set a wallpaper from a local image
              String imagePath = 'path/to/your/image.jpg'; // Replace with your image path
              await AccessWallpaper.setWallpaper(imagePath);
            },
            child: Text('Set Wallpaper'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app with a button that sets a wallpaper when pressed.

# Complete Example of Access Wallpaper Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:access_wallpaper/access_wallpaper.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Wallpaper App')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Set a wallpaper from a local image
              String imagePath = 'path/to/your/image.jpg'; // Replace with your image path
              await AccessWallpaper.setWallpaper(imagePath);
            },
            child: Text('Set Wallpaper'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Wallpaper App'.
// 4. In the body of the Scaffold, a Center widget is used to center the content.
// 5. An ElevatedButton is created, which, when pressed, triggers the onPressed callback.
// 6. Inside the onPressed callback, the setWallpaper method from the access_wallpaper package is called with the path to the image.
// 7. This sets the wallpaper on the device using the specified image path.
