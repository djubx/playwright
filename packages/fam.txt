# Overview of the "fam" Flutter Package

The "fam" package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers to manage and utilize family trees or hierarchical data structures effectively. It provides a simple and intuitive way to represent relationships and connections between entities, making it ideal for applications that require displaying family trees, organizational charts, or any other hierarchical data.

## When to Use "fam"
- **Family Tree Applications**: Ideal for apps that need to visualize family relationships.
- **Organizational Charts**: Useful for displaying company structures or team hierarchies.
- **Data Visualization**: Great for any application that requires a clear representation of parent-child relationships.

## Key Features
- **Hierarchical Data Representation**: Easily create and manage tree-like structures.
- **Customizable Nodes**: Allows for customization of how each node is displayed.
- **Interactive Elements**: Supports touch interactions for expanding and collapsing nodes.
- **Efficient Rendering**: Optimized for performance, ensuring smooth rendering of large trees.

# Setting Up and Using the "fam" Package

## Installation
To get started with the "fam" package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  fam: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/fam).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` if your application requires access to specific features. However, the "fam" package itself does not require any special permissions.

## Basic Usage
To use the "fam" package, you will need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:fam/fam.dart';
```

You can then create a simple family tree structure using the provided classes and methods.

# Complete Example of Using the "fam" Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fam/fam.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Family Tree Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Family Tree'),
        ),
        body: FamilyTreeWidget(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class FamilyTreeWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a sample family tree data structure
    final familyData = FamilyNode(
      name: 'Grandparent',
      children: [
        FamilyNode(
          name: 'Parent 1',
          children: [
            FamilyNode(name: 'Child 1'),
            FamilyNode(name: 'Child 2'),
          ],
        ),
        FamilyNode(
          name: 'Parent 2',
          children: [
            FamilyNode(name: 'Child 3'),
          ],
        ),
      ],
    );

    // Use the Fam widget to display the family tree
    return Fam(
      data: familyData,
      nodeBuilder: (context, node) {
        // Customize how each node is displayed
        return Container(
          padding: EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
          margin: EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 4.0),
          color: Colors.blueAccent,
          child: Text(
            node.name,
            style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 18),
          ),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and the FamilyTreeWidget.
// 3. FamilyTreeWidget creates a hierarchical family data structure using FamilyNode.
// 4. The Fam widget is used to render the family tree, utilizing the nodeBuilder to customize the appearance of each node.
// 5. Each node is displayed in a blue container with the name of the family member, creating a clear visual representation of the family tree.
