# Overview of the is_device_secure Flutter Package

The `is_device_secure` package is a Flutter plugin that allows developers to check whether the device is secure. This is particularly useful for applications that handle sensitive data, such as banking apps or applications that require user authentication. By ensuring that the device is secure, developers can enhance the security of their applications and protect user data.

## When to Use This Package
- **Sensitive Applications**: If your app deals with sensitive information, such as financial data or personal information, you should verify the device's security.
- **Authentication**: Before allowing access to certain features, you can check if the device is secure.
- **Compliance**: For applications that need to comply with security standards, this package can help ensure that the device meets necessary security requirements.

## Key Features
- **Device Security Check**: Easily check if the device is secure.
- **Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS.
- **Simple API**: Provides a straightforward API for checking device security.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using is_device_secure

## Installation
To use the `is_device_secure` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  is_device_secure: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you are accessing sensitive data. However, the `is_device_secure` package does not require any specific permissions.

## Using the Package
To use the package, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:is_device_secure/is_device_secure.dart';
```

You can then check if the device is secure using the following code:

```dart
bool isSecure = await IsDeviceSecure.isDeviceSecure;
```

This will return a boolean indicating whether the device is secure or not.

# Complete Example of Using is_device_secure

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:is_device_secure/is_device_secure.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Device Security Check',
      home: SecureCheckScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class SecureCheckScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SecureCheckScreenState createState() => _SecureCheckScreenState();
}

class _SecureCheckScreenState extends State<SecureCheckScreen> {
  bool? _isSecure;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _checkDeviceSecurity(); // Call the method to check device security on initialization
  }

  Future<void> _checkDeviceSecurity() async {
    // Check if the device is secure
    bool isSecure = await IsDeviceSecure.isDeviceSecure;
    setState(() {
      _isSecure = isSecure; // Update the state with the security status
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Device Security Check'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: _isSecure == null
            ? CircularProgressIndicator() // Show loading indicator while checking
            : Text(
                _isSecure! ? 'Device is Secure' : 'Device is Not Secure',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (SecureCheckScreen).
// 3. SecureCheckScreen is a stateful widget that checks the device's security status.
// 4. In the initState method, _checkDeviceSecurity is called to perform the security check.
// 5. _checkDeviceSecurity uses the is_device_secure package to check if the device is secure.
// 6. The result is stored in the _isSecure variable, and the UI is updated accordingly.
// 7. While the check is in progress, a CircularProgressIndicator is displayed.
// 8. Once the check is complete, a message is displayed indicating whether the device is secure or not.
