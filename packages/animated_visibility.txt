<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Animated Visibility Flutter Package

The `animated_visibility` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to create smooth and visually appealing transitions for widget visibility. This package allows you to animate the visibility of widgets with ease, providing a more dynamic user experience. 

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the `animated_visibility` package in scenarios such as:
- **Dynamic UI Changes**: When you want to show or hide widgets based on user interactions, such as buttons or toggles.
- **Conditional Rendering**: When certain elements of your UI should only be displayed under specific conditions, like error messages or loading indicators.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: To create a more engaging interface by animating the appearance and disappearance of widgets.

## Features

- **Smooth Transitions**: Provides built-in animations for showing and hiding widgets.
- **Customizable Duration**: Allows you to set the duration of the animations to fit your design needs.
- **Flexible Usage**: Can be used with any widget, making it versatile for various UI components.

By leveraging the `animated_visibility` package, developers can enhance their applications with fluid animations that improve the overall user experience.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Animated Visibility

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `animated_visibility` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and include the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  animated_visibility: ^1.0.0
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement animated visibility:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_visibility/animated_visibility.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  bool _isVisible = true;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Animated Visibility Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            AnimatedVisibility(
              visible: _isVisible,
              duration: Duration(milliseconds: 300),
              child: Container(
                width: 200,
                height: 200,
                color: Colors.blue,
                child: Center(child: Text('I am visible!')),
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                setState(() {
                  _isVisible = !_isVisible; // Toggle visibility
                });
              },
              child: Text(_isVisible ? 'Hide' : 'Show'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple app with a button that toggles the visibility of a blue container. The `AnimatedVisibility` widget handles the animation for us.

# Complete Example of Animated Visibility

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_visibility/animated_visibility.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // State variable to control visibility
  bool _isVisible = true;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Animated Visibility Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // AnimatedVisibility widget to animate the visibility of the container
            AnimatedVisibility(
              visible: _isVisible, // Control visibility based on state
              duration: Duration(milliseconds: 300), // Animation duration
              child: Container(
                width: 200, // Width of the container
                height: 200, // Height of the container
                color: Colors.blue, // Background color
                child: Center(child: Text('I am visible!')), // Centered text
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between widgets
            // Button to toggle visibility
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                setState(() {
                  _isVisible = !_isVisible; // Toggle the visibility state
                });
              },
              child: Text(_isVisible ? 'Hide' : 'Show'), // Button text changes based on visibility
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with a StatefulWidget called RealFlutter.
// 2. A boolean state variable _isVisible is initialized to true, indicating that the container is visible.
// 3. The build method constructs the UI, which includes an AppBar and a Center widget containing a Column.
// 4. Inside the Column, an AnimatedVisibility widget is used to wrap a Container. 
//    - The visibility of this container is controlled by the _isVisible state variable.
// 5. The container has a blue background and displays the text "I am visible!" when visible.
// 6. Below the container, an ElevatedButton is provided to toggle the visibility of the container.
// 7. When the button is pressed, the setState method is called, which toggles the _isVisible variable.
// 8. The UI rebuilds, and the AnimatedVisibility widget smoothly animates the appearance or disappearance of the container based on the new state.
```

In summary, the `animated_visibility` package provides a straightforward way to animate widget visibility in Flutter applications. By following the setup and usage instructions, developers can easily implement dynamic UI changes that enhance user experience. The complete example demonstrates how to toggle visibility with smooth animations, making it a valuable addition to any Flutter project.
