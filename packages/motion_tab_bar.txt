# Tutorial: Setting Up Motion Tab Bar

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **motion_tab_bar** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **motion_tab_bar** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  motion_tab_bar: ^0.3.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

# Complete Example of Motion Tab Bar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:motion_tab_bar/motion_tab_bar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Motion Tab Bar Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  // Variable to keep track of the selected tab index
  int _currentIndex = 0;

  // List of widgets to display for each tab
  final List<Widget> _children = [
    Center(child: Text('Home')),
    Center(child: Text('Search')),
    Center(child: Text('Profile')),
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Motion Tab Bar Example'),
      ),
      body: _children[_currentIndex], // Display the current tab's widget
      bottomNavigationBar: MotionTabBar(
        // Define the tabs with icons and labels
        labels: ["Home", "Search", "Profile"],
        icons: [Icons.home, Icons.search, Icons.person],
        initialSelectedTab: "Home", // Set the initial selected tab
        onTabSelected: (String label) {
          // Update the current index based on the selected tab
          setState(() {
            _currentIndex = ["Home", "Search", "Profile"].indexOf(label);
          });
        },
        // Customize the tab bar's animation
        tabIconColor: Colors.grey,
        tabSelectedColor: Colors.blue,
        tabIconSize: 30,
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. The HomeScreen is the main screen of the app, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 4. The _currentIndex variable keeps track of the currently selected tab.
// 5. The _children list contains the widgets to display for each tab.
// 6. The MotionTabBar widget is used in the bottomNavigationBar of the Scaffold.
// 7. When a tab is selected, the onTabSelected callback updates the _currentIndex.
// 8. The body of the Scaffold displays the widget corresponding to the selected tab.
```
