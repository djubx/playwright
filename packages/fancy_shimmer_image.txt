# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Fancy Shimmer Image

In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of setting up and using the `fancy_shimmer_image` package in a Flutter project. We'll cover platform-specific configurations for both Android and iOS to ensure smooth operation.

## Setup Process

1. **Add Dependency**

   First, add the `fancy_shimmer_image` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     fancy_shimmer_image: ^1.0.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**

   Run the following command to install the new package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configurations**

   - **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 19:

     ```gradle
     defaultConfig {
         minSdkVersion 19
     }
     ```

   - **iOS**: No specific configuration is required for iOS, but ensure your deployment target is set to iOS 9.0 or higher in your `ios/Podfile`.

## Using the Package

To use the `fancy_shimmer_image` package, import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:fancy_shimmer_image/fancy_shimmer_image.dart';
```

You can then use the `FancyShimmerImage` widget to display images with a shimmer effect:

```dart
FancyShimmerImage(
  imageUrl: "https://example.com/image.jpg",
  shimmerBaseColor: Colors.grey[300]!,
  shimmerHighlightColor: Colors.grey[100]!,
  boxFit: BoxFit.cover,
)
```

<-- MAIN -->

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fancy_shimmer_image/fancy_shimmer_image.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Fancy Shimmer Image Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: ImageScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ImageScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Shimmer Image Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: FancyShimmerImage(
          // URL of the image to be loaded
          imageUrl: "https://example.com/image.jpg",
          // Base color of the shimmer effect
          shimmerBaseColor: Colors.grey[300]!,
          // Highlight color of the shimmer effect
          shimmerHighlightColor: Colors.grey[100]!,
          // How the image should be inscribed into the box
          boxFit: BoxFit.cover,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp.
// The MaterialApp defines the app's title, theme, and home screen.
// ImageScreen is the home screen, which is a StatelessWidget with a Scaffold.
// The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget.
// The Center widget holds the FancyShimmerImage, which displays the image with a shimmer effect.
// The shimmer effect is customizable with base and highlight colors.
// The image is fetched from the provided URL and displayed with BoxFit.cover to fill the space.
