# Extra Alignments Flutter Package
=====================================

The `extra_alignments` Flutter package provides additional alignment options for widgets, allowing for more precise control over layout. This package is useful when the standard alignment options provided by Flutter are not sufficient.

### Features

*   Additional alignment options for widgets
*   Support for both horizontal and vertical alignments
*   Compatible with various Flutter widgets, such as `Container`, `Row`, and `Column`

### When to Use

The `extra_alignments` package is particularly useful in scenarios where you need more control over the alignment of widgets. For example:

*   When creating complex layouts that require precise alignment of widgets
*   When using widgets like `Row` and `Column` that have limited alignment options
*   When you need to align widgets based on specific conditions or user interactions

# Tutorial: Using the Extra Alignments Package
=============================================

To use the `extra_alignments` package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

Add the `extra_alignments` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  extra_alignments: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

Import the `extra_alignments` package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:extra_alignments/extra_alignments.dart';
```

### Step 3: Use the Alignment Options

Use the additional alignment options provided by the package:

```dart
Container(
  alignment: ExtraAlignments.topLeft,
  child: Text('Top Left'),
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details

The `extra_alignments` package works on both Android and iOS platforms. However, you may need to adjust the alignment options based on the platform's specific requirements.

### Configurations and Optimizations

You can configure the alignment options based on the screen size, orientation, or other conditions. For example:

```dart
Container(
  alignment: MediaQuery.of(context).size.width > 600
      ? ExtraAlignments.topLeft
      : ExtraAlignments.center,
  child: Text('Responsive Alignment'),
)
```

```dart

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Extra Alignments Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Extra Alignments Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(

            Container(
              alignment: ExtraAlignments.topLeft,
              width: 200,
              height: 100,
              color: Colors.red,
              child: Text('Top Left'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),

            // Center Alignment
            Container(
              alignment: ExtraAlignments.center,
              width: 200,
              height: 100,
              color: Colors.green,
              child: Text('Center'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),

            // Bottom Right Alignment
            Container(
              alignment: ExtraAlignments.bottomRight,
              width: 200,
              height: 100,
              color: Colors.blue,
              child: Text('Bottom Right'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app, and the MyApp widget is rendered.
// 2. The MyApp widget builds the MaterialApp with the title and theme.
// 3. The MaterialApp renders the MyHomePage widget as its home page.
// 4. The MyHomePage widget builds the Scaffold with the AppBar and body.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget with a Column.
// 6. The Column contains three Container widgets, each with a different alignment.
// 7. The alignment of each Container is set using the ExtraAlignments class.
// 8. The Container widgets are rendered with their respective alignments.

// In summary, the code flows from the MyApp widget to the MyHomePage widget,
// which renders the Scaffold and its contents. The alignment of the Container
// widgets is set using the ExtraAlignments class, demonstrating its usage.
