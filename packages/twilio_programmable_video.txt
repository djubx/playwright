# Tutorial: Setting Up Twilio Programmable Video in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `twilio_programmable_video` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `twilio_programmable_video` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  twilio_programmable_video: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Configure Android

For Android, you need to ensure that your app has the necessary permissions. Open the `AndroidManifest.xml` file located in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
```

## Step 3: Configure iOS

For iOS, you need to add permissions in the `Info.plist` file located in `ios/Runner/Info.plist`. Add the following entries:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera for video calls.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio during video calls.</string>
```

## Step 4: Initialize Twilio Video

You will need to initialize the Twilio Video SDK in your Flutter application. This typically involves creating a `TwilioVideo` instance and connecting to a room.

## Step 5: Implement Video Call Logic

You can now implement the logic for joining a video room, handling local and remote video tracks, and managing the user interface.

### Example Code

Refer to the complete example below for a practical implementation.

# Complete Example of Twilio Programmable Video in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:twilio_programmable_video/twilio_programmable_video.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Declare variables for the room and local video track
  Room? _room;
  LocalVideoTrack? _localVideoTrack;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the local video track
    _initializeLocalVideo();
  }

  // Function to initialize the local video track
  Future<void> _initializeLocalVideo() async {
    _localVideoTrack = await LocalVideoTrack.create();
  }

  // Function to join a video room
  Future<void> _joinRoom(String roomName) async {
    // Create a connect options object with the access token and local video track
    final connectOptions = ConnectOptions(
      accessToken: 'YOUR_TWILIO_ACCESS_TOKEN',
      roomName: roomName,
      videoTracks: [_localVideoTrack!],
    );

    // Connect to the room
    _room = await TwilioVideo.connect(connectOptions);
    setState(() {});
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the local video track and room when done
    _localVideoTrack?.dispose();
    _room?.disconnect();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Twilio Video Call')),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Display local video track
              if (_localVideoTrack != null)
                VideoRenderer(track: _localVideoTrack!),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () => _joinRoom('testRoom'),
                child: Text('Join Room'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget, we initialize the local video track in initState.
// 3. The _joinRoom function is called when the user presses the "Join Room" button.
// 4. This function creates a ConnectOptions object with the access token and local video track, then connects to the specified room.
// 5. The local video track is displayed using the VideoRenderer widget.
// 6. When the widget is disposed, we clean up by disposing of the local video track and disconnecting from the room.
```
