# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Release Notes Dialog Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `release_notes_dialog` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  release_notes_dialog: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` file to allow for network requests if your release notes are fetched from a remote server. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Here’s a simple example of how to display the release notes dialog.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:release_notes_dialog/release_notes_dialog.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Release Notes Dialog Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Show the release notes dialog when the button is pressed
            showReleaseNotesDialog(context);
          },
          child: Text('Show Release Notes'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void showReleaseNotesDialog(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a list of release notes
    final releaseNotes = [
      'Version 1.0.0: Initial release.',
      'Version 1.1.0: Added new features.',
      'Version 1.2.0: Bug fixes and performance improvements.',
    ];

    // Show the dialog with the release notes
    ReleaseNotesDialog.show(
      context: context,
      title: 'Release Notes',
      notes: releaseNotes,
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app with a button that, when pressed, displays the release notes dialog.

# Complete Example of Release Notes Dialog

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:release_notes_dialog/release_notes_dialog.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Release Notes Dialog Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Show the release notes dialog when the button is pressed
            showReleaseNotesDialog(context);
          },
          child: Text('Show Release Notes'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void showReleaseNotesDialog(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a list of release notes
    final releaseNotes = [
      'Version 1.0.0: Initial release.',
      'Version 1.1.0: Added new features.',
      'Version 1.2.0: Bug fixes and performance improvements.',
    ];

    // Show the dialog with the release notes
    ReleaseNotesDialog.show(
      context: context,
      title: 'Release Notes',
      notes: releaseNotes,
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget contains an AppBar and a centered button.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the showReleaseNotesDialog function is called.
// 5. This function creates a list of release notes and calls ReleaseNotesDialog.show to display them in a dialog.
// 6. The dialog presents the release notes to the user, allowing them to read about the latest updates.
