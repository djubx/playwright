# Flutter Android Developer Mode Package

The `flutter_android_developer_mode` package is a specialized Flutter package designed to facilitate the activation and management of developer options on Android devices. This package is particularly useful for developers who need to test their applications under various developer settings, such as enabling USB debugging, showing touches, or adjusting animation scales.

## When to Use This Package
- **Testing and Debugging**: When you need to enable developer options for testing purposes.
- **Device Management**: For applications that require specific developer settings to function correctly.
- **User Experience**: To provide users with the ability to toggle developer options directly from the app.

## Features
- **Toggle Developer Options**: Easily enable or disable developer options programmatically.
- **Check Developer Mode Status**: Determine if the device is currently in developer mode.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple API for integrating developer mode functionalities into your Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_android_developer_mode

## Installation
To add the `flutter_android_developer_mode` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_android_developer_mode: ^latest_version
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
1. Ensure that your Android project has the necessary permissions in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file. You may need to add:
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_SETTINGS"/>
   ```

2. Make sure your app targets a minimum SDK version that supports the developer options you want to manipulate.

### iOS
- Currently, this package is primarily focused on Android. iOS does not support toggling developer options programmatically due to security restrictions.

## Using the Package
To use the package, you can create a simple interface that allows users to toggle developer options. Below is a basic example of how to implement this.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_android_developer_mode/flutter_android_developer_mode.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Developer Mode Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Check if developer mode is enabled
              bool isDevMode = await FlutterAndroidDeveloperMode.isDeveloperModeEnabled();
              // Toggle developer mode
              if (!isDevMode) {
                await FlutterAndroidDeveloperMode.enableDeveloperMode();
              } else {
                await FlutterAndroidDeveloperMode.disableDeveloperMode();
              }
            },
            child: Text('Toggle Developer Mode'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of flutter_android_developer_mode

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_android_developer_mode/flutter_android_developer_mode.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Developer Mode Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Check if developer mode is enabled
              bool isDevMode = await FlutterAndroidDeveloperMode.isDeveloperModeEnabled();
              
              // Toggle developer mode based on current status
              if (!isDevMode) {
                // Enable developer mode
                await FlutterAndroidDeveloperMode.enableDeveloperMode();
                // Show a message to the user
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(SnackBar(content: Text('Developer Mode Enabled')));
              } else {
                // Disable developer mode
                await FlutterAndroidDeveloperMode.disableDeveloperMode();
                // Show a message to the user
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(SnackBar(content: Text('Developer Mode Disabled')));
              }
            },
            child: Text('Toggle Developer Mode'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

```
// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a simple UI.
// 3. The UI consists of an AppBar and a Center widget containing an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, it checks if developer mode is currently enabled using the isDeveloperModeEnabled method.
// 5. If developer mode is not enabled, it calls enableDeveloperMode to enable it and shows a SnackBar message to inform the user.
// 6. If developer mode is already enabled, it calls disableDeveloperMode to turn it off and shows a corresponding SnackBar message.
// 7. The app provides a simple interface for toggling developer options, making it easy for developers to test their applications under different settings.
