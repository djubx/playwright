# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Bones UI

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with bones_ui, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the bones_ui package:

```dart
import 'package:bones_ui/bones_ui.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using Bones UI Widgets

You can now start using the widgets provided by bones_ui. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use a customizable button from the package:

```dart
CustomButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // Handle button press
  },
  text: 'Click Me',
  color: Colors.blue,
);
```

This button can be styled with different colors, text, and actions, making it versatile for various use cases.

# Complete Example of Using Bones UI

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bones_ui/bones_ui.dart'; // Importing the bones_ui package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the main application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Bones UI Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue, // Setting the primary color
      ),
      home: HomePage(), // Setting the home page
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Bones UI Demo'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: CustomButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Action to perform on button press
            showDialog(
              context: context,
              builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                title: Text('Button Pressed!'), // Dialog title
                content: Text('You have pressed the button.'), // Dialog content
                actions: [
                  TextButton(
                    onPressed: () {
                      Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                    },
                    child: Text('OK'), // Button text
                  ),
                ],
              ),
            );
          },
          text: 'Press Me', // Button text
          color: Colors.blue, // Button color
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home page is set to HomePage, which contains the main UI.
// 4. HomePage builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a centered CustomButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, an AlertDialog is shown with a message and an OK button.
// 6. Pressing the OK button closes the dialog, returning to the main screen.
```
