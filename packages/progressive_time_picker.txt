# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Progressive Time Picker

## Step 1: Adding Dependency
To get started, add the `progressive_time_picker` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  progressive_time_picker: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:progressive_time_picker/progressive_time_picker.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage
You can use the `ProgressiveTimePicker` widget in your Flutter application. Here’s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
ProgressiveTimePicker(
  onTimeChanged: (time) {
    // Handle the time change
    print("Selected time: $time");
  },
)
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Customization
You can customize the appearance of the time picker by passing additional parameters:

```dart
ProgressiveTimePicker(
  onTimeChanged: (time) {
    print("Selected time: $time");
  },
  hourColor: Colors.blue,
  minuteColor: Colors.green,
  secondColor: Colors.red,
)
```

This allows you to match the time picker with your app's theme.

# Complete Example of Progressive Time Picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:progressive_time_picker/progressive_time_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Progressive Time Picker Demo',
      home: TimePickerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class TimePickerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _TimePickerScreenState createState() => _TimePickerScreenState();
}

class _TimePickerScreenState extends State<TimePickerScreen> {
  // Variable to hold the selected time
  TimeOfDay selectedTime = TimeOfDay.now();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Progressive Time Picker'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the selected time
            Text(
              'Selected Time: ${selectedTime.format(context)}',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Progressive Time Picker widget
            ProgressiveTimePicker(
              onTimeChanged: (time) {
                // Update the selected time when the user picks a new time
                setState(() {
                  selectedTime = time;
                });
              },
              hourColor: Colors.blue,
              minuteColor: Colors.green,
              secondColor: Colors.red,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The TimePickerScreen widget is displayed as the home screen.
// 3. Inside TimePickerScreen, the selected time is initialized to the current time.
// 4. The UI consists of a Text widget to display the selected time and the ProgressiveTimePicker widget.
// 5. When the user selects a new time, the onTimeChanged callback is triggered, updating the selectedTime state.
// 6. The UI rebuilds to reflect the newly selected time.
```
