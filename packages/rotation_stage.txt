Here's a detailed technical blog on the "rotation_stage" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Rotation Stage Flutter Package

The **rotation_stage** Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to facilitate the creation of interactive and animated rotation stages in Flutter applications. This package is particularly useful for applications that require 3D-like effects or need to display content in a circular manner, such as games, educational apps, or any application that benefits from a dynamic user interface.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the **rotation_stage** package in scenarios such as:
- Creating a carousel of images or cards that rotate around a central point.
- Developing games that require rotating objects or characters.
- Building educational tools that present information in a circular format, enhancing user engagement.

## Features

- **Customizable Rotation**: Easily adjust the rotation speed and direction.
- **Interactive Controls**: Users can interact with the rotation stage, allowing for a more engaging experience.
- **Smooth Animations**: The package provides smooth transitions and animations, enhancing the visual appeal of your application.
- **Flexible Layouts**: Supports various layouts, making it adaptable to different design requirements.

Overall, the **rotation_stage** package is a versatile tool that can significantly enhance the user experience in Flutter applications by adding dynamic and interactive elements.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Rotation Stage Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **rotation_stage** package, you first need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and include the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  rotation_stage: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file, depending on your app's requirements. For example, if your app uses camera features, add:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the camera for scanning QR codes.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the **rotation_stage** in your app.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:rotation_stage/rotation_stage.dart'; // Import the rotation_stage package

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp()); // Run the main application
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Rotation Stage Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RotationStageDemo(), // Set the home to the demo widget
    );
  }
}

class RotationStageDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RotationStageDemoState createState() => _RotationStageDemoState();
}

class _RotationStageDemoState extends State<RotationStageDemo> {
  // Initialize the rotation stage controller
  final RotationStageController _controller = RotationStageController();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Start the rotation animation
    _controller.startRotation();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the controller when the widget is removed from the widget tree
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Rotation Stage Demo'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: RotationStage(
          controller: _controller, // Pass the controller to the RotationStage
          items: [
            // Define the items to be displayed in the rotation stage
            RotationStageItem(
              child: Container(
                color: Colors.red,
                width: 100,
                height: 100,
                child: Center(child: Text('Item 1')),
              ),
            ),
            RotationStageItem(
              child: Container(
                color: Colors.green,
                width: 100,
                height: 100,
                child: Center(child: Text('Item 2')),
              ),
            ),
            RotationStageItem(
              child: Container(
                color: Colors.blue,
                width: 100,
                height: 100,
                child: Center(child: Text('Item 3')),
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home of the app is set to RotationStageDemo.
// 4. RotationStageDemo initializes a RotationStageController to manage the rotation.
// 5. In initState, the rotation animation starts.
// 6. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 7. The RotationStage widget is created with the controller and a list of items.
// 8. Each item is a colored container with a centered text label.
// 9. The dispose method ensures the controller is properly disposed of when the widget is removed.
```
