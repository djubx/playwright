## Platform-Specific Configuration

    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // or higher
    }
}
```

2. Add any necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml` if required by the package.

    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
To start using the `user_experior` package, you need to initialize it in your main application file. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:user_experior/user_experior.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Initialize User Experior
    UserExperior.initialize('YOUR_API_KEY');

    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'User Experior Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('User Experior Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Log a custom event
            UserExperior.logEvent('button_clicked', {'button_name': 'example_button'});
          },
          child: Text('Click Me!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize the `UserExperior` with an API key and log a custom event when a button is clicked.

# Complete Example of User Experior

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:user_experior/user_experior.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Initialize User Experior with your API key
    UserExperior.initialize('YOUR_API_KEY');

    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'User Experior Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('User Experior Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Log a custom event when the button is clicked
            UserExperior.logEvent('button_clicked', {'button_name': 'example_button'});
          },
          child: Text('Click Me!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp initializes the User Experior package with an API key.
// 3. The MaterialApp widget is created with a title and a home screen.
// 4. HomeScreen is a StatelessWidget that builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 6. When the button is pressed, a custom event 'button_clicked' is logged with a parameter indicating the button's name.
// 7. This event can be tracked in the User Experior dashboard for analysis.
