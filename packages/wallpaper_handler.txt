                  WallpaperHandler.setWallpaper(url: 'https://example.com/wallpaper.jpg');
                },
                child: Text('Set Wallpaper from URL'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user opens the app and is presented with three buttons to set wallpapers from assets, files, and URLs.
// 2. When the user clicks on a button, the corresponding method is called to set the wallpaper.
// 3. The `WallpaperHandler` class handles the process of setting the wallpaper, including requesting permissions and downloading the wallpaper if necessary.
// 4. Once the wallpaper is set, the user is notified through a callback.
// 5. The app remains open, allowing the user to set another wallpaper or exit the app.
