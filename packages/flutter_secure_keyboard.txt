# Setting Up and Using flutter_secure_keyboard

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_secure_keyboard` package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_secure_keyboard` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_secure_keyboard: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_secure_keyboard).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add specific configurations in your `Info.plist` file. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the secure keyboard in your app.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_secure_keyboard/flutter_secure_keyboard.dart';
```

2. Create a widget that utilizes the secure keyboard:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Secure Keyboard Example')),
        body: SecureInputField(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SecureInputField extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SecureInputFieldState createState() => _SecureInputFieldState();
}

class _SecureInputFieldState extends State<SecureInputField> {
  String _input = '';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        SecureKeyboard(
          onChanged: (value) {
            setState(() {
              _input = value;
            });
          },
        ),
        Text('Input: $_input'),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that uses the `SecureKeyboard` widget to handle secure input.

# Complete Example of flutter_secure_keyboard

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_secure_keyboard/flutter_secure_keyboard.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Secure Keyboard Example')),
        body: SecureInputField(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SecureInputField extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SecureInputFieldState createState() => _SecureInputFieldState();
}

class _SecureInputFieldState extends State<SecureInputField> {
  String _input = ''; // Variable to hold the input from the secure keyboard

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center, // Center the input field
      children: [
        SecureKeyboard(
          onChanged: (value) {
            setState(() {
              _input = value; // Update the input variable when the keyboard input changes
            });
          },
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20), // Add some space between the keyboard and the text
        Text('Input: $_input'), // Display the current input
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and the SecureInputField widget.
// 3. SecureInputField is a stateful widget that maintains the current input state.
// 4. The SecureKeyboard widget is used to capture secure input, and its onChanged callback updates the _input variable.
// 5. The current input is displayed below the keyboard, allowing users to see what they have entered.
```

In summary, this blog provided a comprehensive overview of the `flutter_secure_keyboard` package, including its features, setup instructions, and a complete example. By following the steps outlined, you can easily integrate secure input handling into your Flutter applications, enhancing the security of sensitive data entry.
