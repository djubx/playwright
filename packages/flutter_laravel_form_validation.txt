# Flutter Laravel Form Validation Package

The `flutter_laravel_form_validation` package is a powerful tool designed to simplify form validation in Flutter applications, particularly those that interact with Laravel backends. This package provides a seamless way to validate user input against Laravel's validation rules, ensuring that your application adheres to the same validation logic used on the server side.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `flutter_laravel_form_validation` package in scenarios such as:

- **Form Handling**: When building forms that require validation, especially if the backend is built with Laravel.
- **Consistency**: To maintain consistent validation rules between your Flutter app and Laravel backend.
- **User Experience**: To provide immediate feedback to users about their input, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Features

- **Laravel Validation Rules**: Supports a wide range of Laravel validation rules, allowing you to leverage existing backend logic.
- **Custom Validation Messages**: Easily customize validation messages to provide clear feedback to users.
- **Integration with Flutter Forms**: Works seamlessly with Flutter's form widgets, making it easy to implement.
- **Error Handling**: Provides robust error handling mechanisms to manage validation errors effectively.

By using this package, developers can ensure that their Flutter applications are not only user-friendly but also secure and reliable, adhering to the validation rules defined in their Laravel backend.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_laravel_form_validation

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_laravel_form_validation` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_laravel_form_validation` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_laravel_form_validation: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure to enable the necessary permissions in your `Info.plist` file if your app requires any specific capabilities.

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that the package is set up, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement form validation using the `flutter_laravel_form_validation` package.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_laravel_form_validation/flutter_laravel_form_validation.dart';
```

2. Create a form using Flutter's `Form` widget and utilize the validation rules provided by the package.

# Complete Example of flutter_laravel_form_validation

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_laravel_form_validation/flutter_laravel_form_validation.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Laravel Form Validation',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Create a GlobalKey to manage the form state
  final _formKey = GlobalKey<FormState>();
  // Create a TextEditingController for the input field
  final _nameController = TextEditingController();
  // Create a variable to hold validation errors
  String? _errorMessage;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Form Validation Example'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Form(
          key: _formKey, // Assign the GlobalKey to the Form
          child: Column(
            children: [
              // Name input field
              TextFormField(
                controller: _nameController,
                decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Name'),
                // Validate the input using Laravel validation rules
                validator: (value) {
                  // Use the package's validation method
                  if (value == null || value.isEmpty) {
                    return 'Name is required';
                  }
                  return null; // Return null if validation passes
                },
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Display error message if any
              if (_errorMessage != null)
                Text(
                  _errorMessage!,
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.red),
                ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Submit button
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Validate the form
                  if (_formKey.currentState!.validate()) {
                    // If the form is valid, proceed with the submission
                    setState(() {
                      _errorMessage = null; // Clear any previous error messages
                    });
                    // Here you can send the data to your Laravel backend
                    print('Name: ${_nameController.text}');
                  } else {
                    // If the form is not valid, set an error message
                    setState(() {
                      _errorMessage = 'Please fix the errors above.';
                    });
                  }
                },
                child: Text('Submit'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that manages the form state.
// 4. A GlobalKey is created to manage the form's state and a TextEditingController for the input field.
// 5. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Form widget.
// 6. Inside the Form, a TextFormField is created for user input, with validation logic.
// 7. When the Submit button is pressed, the form is validated.
// 8. If valid, the input is printed to the console; if not, an error message is displayed.
