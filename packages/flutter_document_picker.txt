# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Flutter Document Picker

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_document_picker` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_document_picker: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_document_picker).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request permission to access files:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to select documents.</string>
<key>NSDocumentDirectoryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your documents.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Document Picker

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the document picker.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_document_picker/flutter_document_picker.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: DocumentPickerExample(),
    );
  }
}

class DocumentPickerExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DocumentPickerExampleState createState() => _DocumentPickerExampleState();
}

class _DocumentPickerExampleState extends State<DocumentPickerExample> {
  String? _filePath;

  // Function to pick a document
  Future<void> _pickDocument() async {
    // Show the document picker
    final path = await FlutterDocumentPicker.openDocument();
    // Check if a file was selected
    if (path != null) {
      setState(() {
        _filePath = path; // Update the file path state
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Document Picker Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _pickDocument, // Call the document picker
              child: Text('Pick Document'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(_filePath ?? 'No document selected'), // Display selected file path
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
// Import necessary packages
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_document_picker/flutter_document_picker.dart';

// Main class of the application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: DocumentPickerExample(), // Set the home widget
    );
  }
}

// Stateful widget to demonstrate document picking
class DocumentPickerExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DocumentPickerExampleState createState() => _DocumentPickerExampleState();
}

// State class for DocumentPickerExample
class _DocumentPickerExampleState extends State<DocumentPickerExample> {
  String? _filePath; // Variable to hold the selected file path

  // Function to pick a document
  Future<void> _pickDocument() async {
    // Show the document picker and wait for the user to select a document
    final path = await FlutterDocumentPicker.openDocument();
    // Check if a file was selected
    if (path != null) {
      setState(() {
        _filePath = path; // Update the file path state
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Document Picker Example'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _pickDocument, // Call the document picker when pressed
              child: Text('Pick Document'), // Button text
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between button and text
            Text(_filePath ?? 'No document selected'), // Display selected file path or a message
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The app starts and displays a button to pick a document.
// 2. When the button is pressed, the _pickDocument function is called.
// 3. The document picker dialog appears, allowing the user to select a document.
// 4. Once a document is selected, the file path is stored in the _filePath variable.
// 5. The UI updates to display the selected file path or a message indicating no document was selected.
```
