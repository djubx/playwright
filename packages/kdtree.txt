# Exploring the kdtree Flutter Package

The `kdtree` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to implement efficient spatial data structures. KD-trees (k-dimensional trees) are particularly useful for organizing points in a k-dimensional space, making them ideal for applications involving multidimensional data, such as geographic information systems (GIS), computer graphics, and machine learning.

## When to Use kdtree

You might consider using the `kdtree` package in scenarios such as:
- **Geospatial Applications**: When you need to manage and query geographical data points efficiently.
- **Machine Learning**: For nearest neighbor searches in high-dimensional datasets.
- **Game Development**: To optimize collision detection and spatial partitioning.

## Key Features

- **Efficient Search**: Quickly find nearest neighbors in a multidimensional space.
- **Dynamic Insertion and Deletion**: Easily add or remove points from the KD-tree.
- **Customizable**: Supports various data types and dimensions, allowing flexibility in implementation.

The `kdtree` package is a valuable addition to any Flutter developer's toolkit, especially when dealing with complex spatial data.

# Setting Up and Using the kdtree Package

## Installation

To get started with the `kdtree` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and include the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  kdtree: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the platform version in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage

Hereâ€™s how to use the `kdtree` package in your Flutter application:

1. **Import the Package**: Start by importing the package in your Dart file.

   ```dart
   import 'package:kdtree/kdtree.dart';
   ```

2. **Create a KD-Tree**: Initialize a KD-tree with your data points.

   ```dart
   // Create a list of points (2D in this case)
   List<Point> points = [
     Point(1, 2),
     Point(3, 6),
     Point(5, 4),
     Point(7, 8),
     Point(9, 7),
   ];

   // Create a KD-tree from the points
   KDTree<Point> kdTree = KDTree<Point>(points);
   ```

3. **Query the KD-Tree**: Use the KD-tree to find the nearest neighbor to a given point.

   ```dart
   Point queryPoint = Point(4, 5);
   Point nearest = kdTree.nearest(queryPoint);
   print('Nearest point to $queryPoint is $nearest');
   ```

With these steps, you can effectively utilize the `kdtree` package in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Using the kdtree Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:kdtree/kdtree.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'KD-Tree Example',
      home: KDTreeDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class KDTreeDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _KDTreeDemoState createState() => _KDTreeDemoState();
}

class _KDTreeDemoState extends State<KDTreeDemo> {
  // List of points to be added to the KD-tree
  List<Point> points = [
    Point(1, 2),
    Point(3, 6),
    Point(5, 4),
    Point(7, 8),
    Point(9, 7),
  ];

  // KD-tree instance
  late KDTree<Point> kdTree;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the KD-tree with the points
    kdTree = KDTree<Point>(points);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Query point to find the nearest neighbor
    Point queryPoint = Point(4, 5);
    // Find the nearest point in the KD-tree
    Point nearest = kdTree.nearest(queryPoint);

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('KD-Tree Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Nearest point to $queryPoint is $nearest',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. KDTreeDemo is a StatefulWidget that initializes a KD-tree with a list of points.
// 4. In the initState method, the KD-tree is created using the predefined points.
// 5. The build method queries the nearest point to a specified query point (4, 5).
// 6. The nearest point is displayed in the center of the screen.
