# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Story Maker Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started with the **story_maker** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and include the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  story_maker: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package
Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package
In your Dart files, import the package to start using it:

```dart
import 'package:story_maker/story_maker.dart';
```

## Step 5: Basic Usage
You can now use the `RealFlutter` class to create a simple story. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to set up a story:

```dart
RealFlutter(
  title: 'My First Story',
  pages: [
    StoryPage(
      content: 'Once upon a time...',
      image: 'assets/images/story1.png',
    ),
    StoryPage(
      content: 'They lived happily ever after.',
      image: 'assets/images/story2.png',
    ),
  ],
);
```

This code snippet initializes a story with two pages, each containing text and an image.

With these steps, you are now ready to create engaging stories in your Flutter application using the **story_maker** package!

# Complete Example of Using the Story Maker Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:story_maker/story_maker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Story Maker Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: StoryScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class StoryScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('My Story'),
      ),
      body: RealFlutter(
        title: 'My First Story',
        pages: [
          StoryPage(
            content: 'Once upon a time in a faraway land...',
            image: 'assets/images/story1.png',
          ),
          StoryPage(
            content: 'There lived a brave knight.',
            image: 'assets/images/story2.png',
          ),
          StoryPage(
            content: 'He fought dragons and saved the kingdom.',
            image: 'assets/images/story3.png',
          ),
          StoryPage(
            content: 'And they all lived happily ever after.',
            image: 'assets/images/story4.png',
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home of the MaterialApp is set to StoryScreen.
// 4. StoryScreen builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 5. The body contains the RealFlutter widget, which initializes the story.
// 6. The RealFlutter widget takes a title and a list of StoryPage objects.
// 7. Each StoryPage contains content and an image, creating a multi-page story experience.
// 8. Users can navigate through the story pages, enjoying the interactive storytelling experience.
