# Tutorial

## Setup Process

To get started with the `datetime_setting` package, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `datetime_setting` package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     datetime_setting: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
   ```

2. **Install the Package**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions for accessing the device's date and time settings. You may need to add the following permissions:

     ```xml
     <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
     ```

   - **iOS**: For iOS, ensure that you have the correct settings in your `Info.plist` file. You may need to add:

     ```xml
     <key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
     <string>We need your location to set the date and time.</string>
     ```

## Using the Package

Once the package is installed and configured, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a date and time picker using the `datetime_setting` package:

1. **Import the Package**:

   ```dart
   import 'package:datetime_setting/datetime_setting.dart';
   ```

2. **Create a Stateful Widget**: This widget will manage the state of the selected date and time.

   ```dart
   class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
     @override
     _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
   }

   class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
     DateTime selectedDate = DateTime.now();
     TimeOfDay selectedTime = TimeOfDay.now();

     // Method to show date picker
     Future<void> _selectDate(BuildContext context) async {
       final DateTime? picked = await showDatePicker(
         context: context,
         initialDate: selectedDate,
         firstDate: DateTime(2000),
         lastDate: DateTime(2101),
       );
       if (picked != null && picked != selectedDate)
         setState(() {
           selectedDate = picked;
         });
     }

     // Method to show time picker
     Future<void> _selectTime(BuildContext context) async {
       final TimeOfDay? picked = await showTimePicker(
         context: context,
         initialTime: selectedTime,
       );
       if (picked != null && picked != selectedTime)
         setState(() {
           selectedTime = picked;
         });
     }

     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return Scaffold(
         appBar: AppBar(
           title: Text('DateTime Setting Example'),
         ),
         body: Center(
           child: Column(
             mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
             children: <Widget>[
               Text(
                 "Selected date: ${selectedDate.toLocal()}".split(' ')[0],
                 style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
               ),
               Text(
                 "Selected time: ${selectedTime.hour}:${selectedTime.minute}",
                 style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
               ),
               SizedBox(height: 20),
               ElevatedButton(
                 onPressed: () => _selectDate(context),
                 child: Text('Select date'),
               ),
               ElevatedButton(
                 onPressed: () => _selectTime(context),
                 child: Text('Select time'),
               ),
             ],
           ),
         ),
       );
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Run Your Application**: Use the command below to run your application:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

This setup will allow users to select a date and time, which will be displayed on the screen.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:datetime_setting/datetime_setting.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'DateTime Setting Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  DateTime selectedDate = DateTime.now(); // Initialize selected date to now
  TimeOfDay selectedTime = TimeOfDay.now(); // Initialize selected time to now

  // Method to show date picker
  Future<void> _selectDate(BuildContext context) async {
    final DateTime? picked = await showDatePicker(
      context: context,
      initialDate: selectedDate, // Set initial date
      firstDate: DateTime(2000), // Minimum date
      lastDate: DateTime(2101), // Maximum date
    );
    if (picked != null && picked != selectedDate) // Check if a new date is picked
      setState(() {
        selectedDate = picked; // Update selected date
      });
  }

  // Method to show time picker
  Future<void> _selectTime(BuildContext context) async {
    final TimeOfDay? picked = await showTimePicker(
      context: context,
      initialTime: selectedTime, // Set initial time
    );
    if (picked != null && picked != selectedTime) // Check if a new time is picked
      setState(() {
        selectedTime = picked; // Update selected time
      });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('DateTime Setting Example'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              "Selected date: ${selectedDate.toLocal()}".split(' ')[0], // Display selected date
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            Text(
              "Selected time: ${selectedTime.hour}:${selectedTime.minute}", // Display selected time
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Add space between buttons and text
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () => _selectDate(context), // Call date picker
              child: Text('Select date'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () => _selectTime(context), // Call time picker
              child: Text('Select time'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home as RealFlutter.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the selected date and time.
// 4. The _selectDate method opens a date picker dialog, allowing the user to select a date.
// 5. The _selectTime method opens a time picker dialog, allowing the user to select a time.
// 6. The selected date and time are displayed on the screen, and the user can update them by pressing the respective buttons.
