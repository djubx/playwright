# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_calendar_week

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_calendar_week` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_calendar_week` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_calendar_week: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `flutter_calendar_week` in your app.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_calendar_week/flutter_calendar_week.dart';
```

2. Create a StatefulWidget to manage the calendar state:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  DateTime selectedDate = DateTime.now(); // Track the selected date

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Calendar Week Example'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          CalendarWeek(
            onDateSelected: (date) {
              setState(() {
                selectedDate = date; // Update the selected date
              });
            },
            initialDate: selectedDate, // Set the initial date
          ),
          // Display the selected date
          Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
            child: Text(
              'Selected Date: ${selectedDate.toLocal()}'.split(' ')[0],
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Run your application to see the calendar in action!

# Complete Example of flutter_calendar_week

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_calendar_week/flutter_calendar_week.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Calendar Week Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(), // Set the home to our RealFlutter widget
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  DateTime selectedDate = DateTime.now(); // Track the selected date

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Calendar Week Example'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          CalendarWeek(
            onDateSelected: (date) {
              setState(() {
                selectedDate = date; // Update the selected date
              });
            },
            initialDate: selectedDate, // Set the initial date
          ),
          // Display the selected date
          Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
            child: Text(
              'Selected Date: ${selectedDate.toLocal()}'.split(' ')[0], // Show the selected date
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets MyApp as the root widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme, setting RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the selected date.
// 4. The CalendarWeek widget is displayed, allowing users to select a date.
// 5. When a date is selected, the onDateSelected callback updates the selectedDate state.
// 6. The selected date is displayed below the calendar, updating dynamically as the user interacts with the calendar.
```
