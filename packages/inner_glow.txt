# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Inner Glow

## Installation
To add the **inner_glow** package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  inner_glow: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/inner_glow).

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if you are using any features that require user permissions. However, the inner glow effect itself does not require special permissions.

## Using the Package
To use the inner glow effect, wrap your widget with the `InnerGlow` widget provided by the package. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:inner_glow/inner_glow.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Inner Glow Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: InnerGlow(
          glowColor: Colors.blue,
          child: Container(
            width: 200,
            height: 100,
            color: Colors.white,
            child: Center(child: Text('Glow Effect')),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `InnerGlow` widget wraps a `Container`, applying a blue inner glow effect to it.

# Complete Example of Inner Glow

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:inner_glow/inner_glow.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Inner Glow Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Inner Glow Example')),
      body: Center(
        // Wrapping the Container with InnerGlow to apply the glow effect
        child: InnerGlow(
          glowColor: Colors.blue, // Setting the glow color to blue
          child: Container(
            width: 200, // Width of the container
            height: 100, // Height of the container
            color: Colors.white, // Background color of the container
            child: Center(
              // Centering the text inside the container
              child: Text(
                'Glow Effect', // Text to display
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20), // Text style
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, the InnerGlow widget is used to wrap a Container.
// 5. The InnerGlow widget applies a blue glow effect to the Container.
// 6. The Container has a fixed width and height, with a white background.
// 7. A Text widget is centered inside the Container, displaying "Glow Effect".
// 8. The app runs smoothly, showcasing the inner glow effect on the specified widget.
