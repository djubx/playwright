# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Customizable Space Bar

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the **customizable_space_bar** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  customizable_space_bar: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:customizable_space_bar/customizable_space_bar.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Customizable Space Bar
You can now use the `CustomizableSpaceBar` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
CustomizableSpaceBar(
  background: Container(color: Colors.blue),
  spaceBar: Text(
    'Press Space',
    style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
  ),
  onPressed: () {
    print('Space bar pressed!');
  },
);
```

This code creates a space bar with a blue background and a text label. The `onPressed` callback is triggered when the space bar is pressed.

# Complete Example of Customizable Space Bar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:customizable_space_bar/customizable_space_bar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Customizable Space Bar Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Customizable Space Bar Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: CustomizableSpaceBar(
            // Background color of the space bar
            background: Container(color: Colors.blue),
            // The content displayed on the space bar
            spaceBar: Text(
              'Press Space',
              style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
            ),
            // Callback function when the space bar is pressed
            onPressed: () {
              // Print a message to the console
              print('Space bar pressed!');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Customizable Space Bar Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers the CustomizableSpaceBar widget.
// 5. The CustomizableSpaceBar has a blue background and displays the text 'Press Space'.
// 6. When the space bar is pressed, it triggers the onPressed callback, printing 'Space bar pressed!' to the console.
