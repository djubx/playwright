// The app starts by running the `RealFlutter` widget, which is a stateless widget that builds the app's UI.
// The `RealFlutter` widget uses the `MaterialApp` widget to create a material design app, and sets the title and theme of the app.
// The `home` property of the `MaterialApp` widget is set to a `Scaffold` widget, which provides a basic material design layout structure.
// The `body` property of the `Scaffold` widget is set to a `Center` widget, which centers its child widget horizontally and vertically.
// The `child` property of the `Center` widget is set to a `Column` widget, which arranges its child widgets vertically.
// The `Column` widget contains three child widgets: a `GlowyBorder` widget that wraps a `Container` widget, a `GlowyBorder` widget that wraps a `Text` widget, and a `GlowyBorder` widget that wraps an `Image` widget.
// Each `GlowyBorder` widget creates a glowy border around its child widget, using the specified color, width, and style.
// The app's UI is updated when the user interacts with the widgets, such as tapping on the text or image widgets.
