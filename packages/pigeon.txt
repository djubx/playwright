# Pigeon Flutter Package: Bridging Flutter and Native Code

The Pigeon package in Flutter is a powerful tool designed to facilitate communication between Flutter and platform-specific code (iOS and Android). It generates type-safe message passing code, allowing Flutter to interact with native APIs seamlessly. This package is particularly useful when you need to access platform-specific features or APIs that are not available in Flutter's standard library.

## When to Use Pigeon

- **Platform-Specific Features**: When your Flutter app needs to access native features like camera, sensors, or Bluetooth, which require platform-specific implementations.
- **Performance Optimization**: For operations that are more efficiently handled in native code, such as complex computations or hardware-accelerated tasks.
- **Existing Native Code**: If you have existing native code that you want to integrate into your Flutter app.

## Key Features

- **Type Safety**: Pigeon generates type-safe code, reducing runtime errors and improving code reliability.
- **Cross-Platform**: Supports both Android and iOS, making it easier to write platform-specific code in a unified manner.
- **Easy Integration**: Simplifies the process of writing platform channels by generating boilerplate code.

# Setting Up and Using the Pigeon Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the Pigeon package and demonstrate how to use it to communicate between Flutter and native code on both Android and iOS platforms.

## Setup Process

### Step 1: Add Pigeon to Your Project

Add Pigeon as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  pigeon: ^1.0.0
```

### Step 2: Define Your API

Create a Dart file to define the API that you want to use for communication. For example, create a file named `api.dart`:

```dart
import 'package:pigeon/pigeon.dart';

class RealFlutter {
  String? message;
}

@HostApi()
abstract class RealFlutterApi {
  RealFlutter getRealFlutterMessage();
  void setRealFlutterMessage(RealFlutter msg);
}
```

### Step 3: Generate Code

Run the Pigeon command to generate the necessary code:

```bash
flutter pub run pigeon \
  --input pigeons/api.dart \
  --dart_out lib/real_flutter_api.dart \
  --objc_header_out ios/Runner/real_flutter_api.h \
  --objc_source_out ios/Runner/real_flutter_api.m \
  --java_out android/app/src/main/java/com/example/app/RealFlutterApi.java
```

### Step 4: Implement Platform-Specific Code

#### Android

In `RealFlutterApi.java`, implement the methods defined in your API:

```java
package com.example.app;

import androidx.annotation.NonNull;

public class RealFlutterApiImpl implements RealFlutterApi {
    @Override
    public RealFlutter getRealFlutterMessage() {
        RealFlutter message = new RealFlutter();
        message.setMessage("Hello from Android!");
        return message;
    }

    @Override
    public void setRealFlutterMessage(@NonNull RealFlutter msg) {
        // Handle the message from Flutter
    }
}
```

#### iOS

In `real_flutter_api.m`, implement the methods:

```objc
#import "real_flutter_api.h"

@implementation RealFlutterApiImpl
- (RealFlutter *)getRealFlutterMessage:(FlutterError **)error {
    RealFlutter *message = [[RealFlutter alloc] init];
    message.message = @"Hello from iOS!";
    return message;
}

- (void)setRealFlutterMessage:(RealFlutter *)msg error:(FlutterError **)error {
    // Handle the message from Flutter
}
@end
```

### Step 5: Use the API in Flutter

In your Flutter code, use the generated API to communicate with the native code:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'real_flutter_api.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  final RealFlutterApi _api = RealFlutterApi();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Pigeon Example')),
        body: FutureBuilder<RealFlutter>(
          future: _api.getRealFlutterMessage(),
          builder: (context, snapshot) {
            if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.done) {
              return Center(child: Text(snapshot.data?.message ?? 'No message'));
            } else {
              return CircularProgressIndicator();
            }
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

<-- MAIN -->

```dart
// main.dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'real_flutter_api.dart'; // Import the generated API

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp()); // Entry point of the Flutter application
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  final RealFlutterApi _api = RealFlutterApi(); // Initialize the API

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Build the main widget tree
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Pigeon Example')), // App bar with title
        body: FutureBuilder<RealFlutter>(
          // Use FutureBuilder to handle asynchronous data
          future: _api.getRealFlutterMessage(), // Call the native method
          builder: (context, snapshot) {
            // Build the UI based on the snapshot state
            if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.done) {
              // If the future is complete, display the message
              return Center(child: Text(snapshot.data?.message ?? 'No message'));
            } else {
              // Otherwise, show a loading indicator
              return CircularProgressIndicator();
            }
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow:
// 1. The app starts and runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp initializes the RealFlutterApi to communicate with native code.
// 3. The FutureBuilder widget calls getRealFlutterMessage() to fetch data from the native side.
// 4. While waiting for the data, a CircularProgressIndicator is displayed.
// 5. Once the data is received, the message is displayed in the center of the screen.
// 6. The native code on Android and iOS returns a platform-specific message, demonstrating cross-platform communication.
