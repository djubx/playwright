# Speed Test Dart Flutter Package

The `speed_test_dart` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to measure network speed and performance within their applications. This package provides a simple and efficient way to conduct speed tests, allowing developers to assess the quality of the user's internet connection. 

## When to Use This Package
You might consider using the `speed_test_dart` package in scenarios such as:
- **Network Diagnostics**: To help users understand their internet speed and connectivity issues.
- **Performance Monitoring**: To monitor the performance of your app based on the user's internet speed.
- **User Experience Optimization**: To adjust app behavior based on the detected network speed, such as loading lower-quality images on slower connections.

## Features
- **Download and Upload Speed Measurement**: Accurately measures both download and upload speeds.
- **Ping Measurement**: Provides latency information to help assess connection quality.
- **Customizable Test Parameters**: Allows developers to configure test parameters such as server selection and test duration.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices.

With these features, the `speed_test_dart` package is an essential tool for any Flutter application that requires network performance assessment.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Speed Test Dart Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the `speed_test_dart` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  speed_test_dart: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to access the internet. Add the following lines inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you need to ensure that your app has the appropriate permissions set in the `Info.plist` file. Add the following key-value pair:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the speed test functionality.

# Complete Example of Using Speed Test Dart

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:speed_test_dart/speed_test_dart.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  SpeedTestDart speedTestDart = SpeedTestDart();
  String downloadSpeed = '';
  String uploadSpeed = '';
  String ping = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Start the speed test when the app initializes
    startSpeedTest();
  }

  void startSpeedTest() async {
    // Start the download speed test
    speedTestDart.startDownloadTesting(
      onDone: (double transferRate) {
        setState(() {
          downloadSpeed = transferRate.toStringAsFixed(2) + ' Mbps';
        });
      },
      onError: (String error) {
        setState(() {
          downloadSpeed = 'Error: $error';
        });
      },
    );

    // Start the upload speed test
    speedTestDart.startUploadTesting(
      onDone: (double transferRate) {
        setState(() {
          uploadSpeed = transferRate.toStringAsFixed(2) + ' Mbps';
        });
      },
      onError: (String error) {
        setState(() {
          uploadSpeed = 'Error: $error';
        });
      },
    );

    // Start the ping test
    speedTestDart.startPingTesting(
      onDone: (double pingValue) {
        setState(() {
          ping = pingValue.toStringAsFixed(2) + ' ms';
        });
      },
      onError: (String error) {
        setState(() {
          ping = 'Error: $error';
        });
      },
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Speed Test Dart Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text('Download Speed: $downloadSpeed'),
              Text('Upload Speed: $uploadSpeed'),
              Text('Ping: $ping'),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the initState method, the startSpeedTest function is called to initiate the speed tests.
// 3. The startDownloadTesting method measures the download speed and updates the UI when done.
// 4. The startUploadTesting method measures the upload speed and updates the UI when done.
// 5. The startPingTesting method measures the ping and updates the UI when done.
// 6. The results are displayed in the center of the screen, showing the download speed, upload speed, and ping.
