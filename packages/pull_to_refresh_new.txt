- You need a customizable and easy-to-implement solution that integrates seamlessly with existing Flutter widgets.

## Features

- **Customizable Refresh Indicators**: The package allows you to customize the appearance and behavior of the refresh indicator.
- **Easy Integration**: It can be easily integrated with existing scrollable widgets.
- **Support for Multiple Scrollable Widgets**: Works with `ListView`, `GridView`, and other scrollable widgets.
- **Control Over Refreshing State**: Provides methods to programmatically control the refreshing state.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Pull to Refresh New Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `pull_to_refresh_new` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `pull_to_refresh_new` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  pull_to_refresh_new: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` in your terminal to install the package.

## Step 2: Basic Setup

Next, you need to import the package in your Dart file where you want to use it:

```dart
import 'package:pull_to_refresh_new/pull_to_refresh_new.dart';
```

## Step 3: Implementing Pull to Refresh

Here’s how to implement the pull-to-refresh functionality in a simple Flutter app:

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now, let’s create a simple example using the `pull_to_refresh_new` package. Below is a basic implementation:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pull_to_refresh_new/pull_to_refresh_new.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  List<String> items = List.generate(20, (index) => "Item $index");
  RefreshController _refreshController =
      RefreshController(initialRefresh: false);

  void _onRefresh() async {
    // Simulate a network request
    await Future.delayed(Duration(milliseconds: 1000));
    // Update the items list
    setState(() {
      items.add("Item ${items.length}");
    });
    // Complete the refresh
    _refreshController.refreshCompleted();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Pull to Refresh Example")),
      body: SmartRefresher(
        controller: _refreshController,
        onRefresh: _onRefresh,
        child: ListView.builder(
          itemCount: items.length,
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            return ListTile(title: Text(items[index]));
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple list of items that can be refreshed by pulling down. The `_onRefresh` method simulates a network request and updates the list.

# Complete Example of Pull to Refresh New Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pull_to_refresh_new/pull_to_refresh_new.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // List to hold the items displayed in the ListView
  List<String> items = List.generate(20, (index) => "Item $index");
  
  // Controller for managing the refresh state
  RefreshController _refreshController =
      RefreshController(initialRefresh: false);

  // Method to handle the refresh action
  void _onRefresh() async {
    // Simulate a network request with a delay
    await Future.delayed(Duration(milliseconds: 1000));
    
    // Update the items list by adding a new item
    setState(() {
      items.add("Item ${items.length}");
    });
    
    // Complete the refresh action
    _refreshController.refreshCompleted();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Pull to Refresh Example")),
      body: SmartRefresher(
        // Assign the refresh controller
        controller: _refreshController,
        // Set the onRefresh callback
        onRefresh: _onRefresh,
        child: ListView.builder(
          // Build the list of items
          itemCount: items.length,
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            return ListTile(title: Text(items[index]));
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 2. The _RealFlutterState class manages the state of the widget.
// 3. A list of items is generated and displayed in a ListView.
// 4. The RefreshController is initialized to manage the refresh state.
// 5. When the user pulls down to refresh, the _onRefresh method is called.
// 6. This method simulates a network request and updates the list of items.
// 7. After the items are updated, the refresh is completed, and the UI is rebuilt.
