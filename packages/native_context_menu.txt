<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Native Context Menu Flutter Package

The `native_context_menu` Flutter package provides a way to create native context menus in your Flutter applications. Context menus are essential for enhancing user experience by providing quick access to actions related to a specific item or area in the app. This package allows developers to implement context menus that feel native to both Android and iOS platforms.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `native_context_menu` package when:
- You want to provide users with quick actions related to a specific item (e.g., long-pressing a list item).
- You need to implement a context menu that behaves consistently across both Android and iOS.
- You want to enhance the usability of your app by providing contextual actions without cluttering the UI.

## Features

- **Native Look and Feel**: The package ensures that the context menus look and behave like native menus on both Android and iOS.
- **Customizable Menu Items**: You can easily customize the items in the context menu, including icons and actions.
- **Easy Integration**: The package is straightforward to integrate into existing Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Native Context Menu Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `native_context_menu` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  native_context_menu: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions. Typically, no special permissions are required for context menus, but ensure your app's minimum SDK version is set appropriately.

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add specific configurations in your `Info.plist` file if you are using any features that require permissions. However, for basic context menu functionality, no additional configurations are necessary.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Hereâ€™s how to use the `native_context_menu` package in your Flutter application:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

   ```dart
   import 'package:native_context_menu/native_context_menu.dart';
   ```

2. Create a context menu using the `NativeContextMenu` class. You can define the menu items and their actions.

3. Attach the context menu to a widget, such as a `ListTile` or any other widget that supports gestures.

### Example Code Snippet

```dart
NativeContextMenu(
  items: [
    NativeContextMenuItem(
      title: 'Edit',
      onTap: () {
        // Handle edit action
      },
    ),
    NativeContextMenuItem(
      title: 'Delete',
      onTap: () {
        // Handle delete action
      },
    ),
  ],
  child: GestureDetector(
    onLongPress: () {
      // Show the context menu
    },
    child: Container(
      padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
      child: Text('Long press me!'),
    ),
  ),
);
```

This snippet demonstrates how to create a simple context menu with "Edit" and "Delete" options that appear when the user long-presses the container.

# Complete Example of Using the Native Context Menu Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:native_context_menu/native_context_menu.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Native Context Menu Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Native Context Menu Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: NativeContextMenu(
            items: [
              NativeContextMenuItem(
                title: 'Edit',
                onTap: () {
                  // Handle edit action
                  print('Edit action selected');
                },
              ),
              NativeContextMenuItem(
                title: 'Delete',
                onTap: () {
                  // Handle delete action
                  print('Delete action selected');
                },
              ),
            ],
            child: GestureDetector(
              onLongPress: () {
                // Show the context menu
                print('Long pressed! Showing context menu...');
              },
              child: Container(
                padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
                color: Colors.blueAccent,
                child: Text(
                  'Long press me!',
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title "Native Context Menu Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a NativeContextMenu widget.
// 5. The NativeContextMenu has two items: "Edit" and "Delete", each with their respective onTap actions.
// 6. A GestureDetector wraps a Container that displays the text "Long press me!".
// 7. When the user long-presses the container, the context menu is shown, allowing the user to select an action.
// 8. Selecting an action triggers the corresponding onTap function, which currently prints a message to the console.
