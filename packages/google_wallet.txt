### Final Summary

The code flows as follows:

1.  The app initializes the Google Wallet API and creates a pass.
2.  The user can add the pass to their Google Wallet by pressing the "Add Pass" button, which triggers the `addPass` API call.
3.  The user can update the pass information by pressing the "Update Pass" button, which triggers the `updatePass` API call.
4.  The user can remove the pass from their Google Wallet by pressing the "Remove Pass" button, which triggers the `removePass` API call.
5.  Each API call is made to the Google Wallet API, and the app prints a message to the console after each call to indicate the result.

Overall, the code demonstrates how to use the `google_wallet` package to interact with the Google Wallet API and manage passes in a user's Google Wallet.
