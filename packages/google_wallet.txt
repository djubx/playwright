# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Google Wallet Package

## Installation
To get started with the `google_wallet` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  google_wallet: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/google_wallet).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Add the necessary permissions and metadata in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<manifest>
    <application>
        ...
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.google.android.gms.wallet.api.enabled"
            android:value="true" />
    </application>
</manifest>
```

2. **Enable Google Wallet API**: Ensure that the Google Wallet API is enabled in your Google Cloud Console.

### iOS
1. **Update Info.plist**: Add the required permissions in your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save passes.</string>
```

2. **Enable Google Wallet API**: Similar to Android, ensure that the Google Wallet API is enabled in your Google Cloud Console.

## Basic Usage
Once you have installed the package and configured your project, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create and display a pass.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:google_wallet/google_wallet.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Google Wallet Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Create a new pass
              final pass = WalletPass(
                id: '123456',
                title: 'My Loyalty Card',
                description: 'Earn points with every purchase!',
                barcode: '1234567890',
              );

              // Add the pass to Google Wallet
              GoogleWallet.addPass(pass);
            },
            child: Text('Add Pass to Google Wallet'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app with a button that, when pressed, adds a loyalty card pass to Google Wallet.

# Complete Example of Google Wallet Integration

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:google_wallet/google_wallet.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Google Wallet Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Step 1: Create a new pass object
              final pass = WalletPass(
                id: '123456', // Unique identifier for the pass
                title: 'My Loyalty Card', // Title of the pass
                description: 'Earn points with every purchase!', // Description of the pass
                barcode: '1234567890', // Barcode for scanning
              );

              // Step 2: Add the pass to Google Wallet
              GoogleWallet.addPass(pass);
            },
            child: Text('Add Pass to Google Wallet'), // Button text
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which builds a MaterialApp.
// 2. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. The Center widget contains an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, a new WalletPass object is created with an ID, title, description, and barcode.
// 5. The pass is then added to Google Wallet using the GoogleWallet.addPass method.
// 6. This allows users to save their loyalty card directly to their Google Wallet for easy access.
