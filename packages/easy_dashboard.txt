# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Easy Dashboard

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **easy_dashboard** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **easy_dashboard** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  easy_dashboard: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple dashboard using the **easy_dashboard** widgets. Below is an example of how to implement a basic dashboard layout.

<!-- END_TUTORIAL -->

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:easy_dashboard/easy_dashboard.dart'; // Import the easy_dashboard package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Easy Dashboard Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: DashboardScreen(), // Set the home screen to DashboardScreen
    );
  }
}

class DashboardScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Dashboard'), // Title of the dashboard
      ),
      body: EasyDashboard(
        // Create an EasyDashboard widget
        children: [
          DashboardCard(
            title: 'Sales',
            value: '1500',
            icon: Icons.attach_money,
          ),
          DashboardCard(
            title: 'Users',
            value: '300',
            icon: Icons.people,
          ),
          DashboardCard(
            title: 'Orders',
            value: '75',
            icon: Icons.shopping_cart,
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to DashboardScreen, which is the main screen of the app.
// 4. The DashboardScreen widget creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 5. The body contains an EasyDashboard widget, which holds multiple DashboardCard widgets.
// 6. Each DashboardCard displays a title, a value, and an icon, representing different metrics on the dashboard.
```
<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple dashboard with three cards displaying sales, users, and orders. The application flow is straightforward: it initializes the app, sets up the main screen, and displays the dashboard with relevant metrics.

### Final Summary

The **easy_dashboard** package allows developers to create dashboards quickly and efficiently. By following the setup and usage instructions, you can integrate this package into your Flutter applications and leverage its customizable widgets to build visually appealing dashboards. The provided example demonstrates how to set up a basic dashboard, and you can expand upon this foundation to create more complex and feature-rich dashboards as needed.
