# Onegini Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the Onegini package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  onegini: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/onegini).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure you have the following configurations:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:
   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. Ensure your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:
   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

## Basic Usage
Once you have installed and configured the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initialize Onegini and perform user authentication.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:onegini/onegini.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Onegini Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Onegini Authentication')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initialize Onegini
              await Onegini.initialize();

              // Perform user login
              var result = await Onegini.login(username: 'user', password: 'pass');
              if (result.isSuccessful) {
                // Handle successful login
                print('Login successful!');
              } else {
                // Handle login failure
                print('Login failed: ${result.error}');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Login'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code initializes the Onegini SDK and provides a simple login button that, when pressed, attempts to log in a user.

# Complete Example of Onegini in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:onegini/onegini.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Onegini Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Onegini Authentication')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initialize Onegini SDK
              await Onegini.initialize();

              // Attempt to log in the user
              var result = await Onegini.login(username: 'user', password: 'pass');
              if (result.isSuccessful) {
                // If login is successful, navigate to the home screen
                print('Login successful!');
                // You can navigate to another screen here
              } else {
                // If login fails, display the error
                print('Login failed: ${result.error}');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Login'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which builds a MaterialApp.
// 2. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, there is an ElevatedButton labeled 'Login'.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the Onegini SDK is initialized.
// 5. The app then attempts to log in using the provided username and password.
// 6. If the login is successful, a message is printed to the console, and you can navigate to another screen.
// 7. If the login fails, the error message is printed to the console.
