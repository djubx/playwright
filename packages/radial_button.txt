# Radial Button Flutter Package

The **radial_button** Flutter package provides a customizable radial button widget that enhances user interaction in mobile applications. This package is particularly useful for applications that require a unique and engaging way to present options to users, such as in games, multimedia applications, or any app that benefits from a visually appealing interface.

## When to Use

You might consider using the radial button package in scenarios such as:
- **Game Development**: For selecting game modes or options in a visually engaging way.
- **Media Applications**: To control playback options like play, pause, and skip in a circular layout.
- **Custom Navigation**: To create a unique navigation experience that stands out from traditional button layouts.

## Features
- **Customizable Appearance**: You can easily change colors, sizes, and shapes to fit your app's theme.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Radial Button Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the radial_button package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  radial_button: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file, depending on your app's functionality. For example, if your app uses network features, you might need to add:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Radial Button

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a radial button in your app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:radial_button/radial_button.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Radial Button Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: RadialButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Action to perform when the button is pressed
              print('Radial Button Pressed!');
            },
            child: Text('Press Me'),
            color: Colors.blue,
            size: 100.0,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with a radial button in the center. The button prints a message to the console when pressed.

### Summary

In this tutorial, we covered how to set up the radial_button package in your Flutter project, including platform-specific configurations for Android and iOS. We also demonstrated how to create a basic radial button and handle its press event.

# Complete Example of Radial Button in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:radial_button/radial_button.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Radial Button Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: RadialButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Action to perform when the button is pressed
              print('Radial Button Pressed!');
            },
            child: Text('Press Me'),
            color: Colors.blue,
            size: 100.0,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the main UI.
// 3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// 4. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Radial Button Example'.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold is centered, containing a RadialButton widget.
// 6. The RadialButton has an onPressed callback that prints a message to the console when pressed.
// 7. The button is styled with a blue color and a size of 100.0.
// 8. Finally, the runApp function is called to launch the application with the RealFlutter widget.
