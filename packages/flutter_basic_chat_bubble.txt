# Complete Example of flutter_basic_chat_bubble

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_basic_chat_bubble/flutter_basic_chat_bubble.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Chat Bubble Example',
      home: ChatScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ChatScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Chat Bubble Example'),
      ),
      body: ListView(
        padding: EdgeInsets.all(10),
        children: [
          // Incoming message bubble
          ChatBubble(
            message: "Hello! How are you?",
            isSender: false, // false for incoming message
            color: Colors.blue[200],
          ),
          // Outgoing message bubble
          ChatBubble(
            message: "I'm good, thanks! How about you?",
            isSender: true, // true for outgoing message
            color: Colors.green[200],
          ),
          // Another incoming message bubble
          ChatBubble(
            message: "I'm doing well, thank you!",
            isSender: false,
            color: Colors.blue[200],
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The above code creates a simple chat interface using the flutter_basic_chat_bubble package.
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 2. The ChatScreen widget builds the UI with an AppBar and a ListView to display chat messages.
// 3. Each ChatBubble widget represents a message, with the 'isSender' property determining its alignment.
// 4. The color property allows customization of the bubble's appearance, enhancing the visual experience.
// 5. The ListView allows for scrolling through messages, making it suitable for chat applications.
