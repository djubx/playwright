# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Video Editor SDK

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `video_editor_sdk` package and explain how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `video_editor_sdk` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  video_editor_sdk: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/video_editor_sdk).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure that you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version required
        ...
    }
}
```

2. Add the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to edit videos.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to record videos.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone to record audio.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Video Editor SDK

Now that we have set up the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the video editor functionality.

<!-- END_TUTORIAL -->

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:video_editor_sdk/video_editor_sdk.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Video Editor SDK Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: VideoEditorScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class VideoEditorScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _VideoEditorScreenState createState() => _VideoEditorScreenState();
}

class _VideoEditorScreenState extends State<VideoEditorScreen> {
  // This function will be called when the user wants to edit a video
  void _editVideo() async {
    // Initialize the video editor SDK
    final result = await VideoEditorSDK.openEditor(
      videoPath: 'path_to_your_video.mp4', // Path to the video file
    );

    // Check if the user has saved the edited video
    if (result != null) {
      // Handle the edited video (e.g., save it or display it)
      print('Edited video saved at: ${result.outputPath}');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Video Editor SDK Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _editVideo, // Call the edit video function on button press
          child: Text('Edit Video'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The home screen is set to VideoEditorScreen, where the main functionality resides.
// 3. When the user presses the "Edit Video" button, the _editVideo function is called.
// 4. Inside _editVideo, the VideoEditorSDK is initialized with the path to the video file.
// 5. If the user saves the edited video, the output path is printed to the console.
```
