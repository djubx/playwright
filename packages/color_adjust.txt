# Setting Up and Using the `color_adjust` Package

## Installation

To get started with the `color_adjust` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  color_adjust: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage

To use the `color_adjust` package, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:color_adjust/color_adjust.dart';
```

You can then create an instance of the `ColorAdjust` class and use its methods to manipulate colors. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
Color originalColor = Colors.blue;
Color adjustedColor = ColorAdjust.adjustBrightness(originalColor, 0.2); // Increase brightness by 20%
```

This will give you a new color that is 20% brighter than the original blue color.

With these steps, you are now ready to start using the `color_adjust` package in your Flutter applications!

# Complete Example of Using `color_adjust`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:color_adjust/color_adjust.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Color Adjust Example',
      home: ColorAdjustDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class ColorAdjustDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ColorAdjustDemoState createState() => _ColorAdjustDemoState();
}

class _ColorAdjustDemoState extends State<ColorAdjustDemo> {
  Color _originalColor = Colors.blue; // Original color
  Color _adjustedColor; // Color after adjustment
  double _brightness = 0.0; // Brightness adjustment value

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _adjustedColor = _originalColor; // Initialize adjusted color
  }

  void _adjustColor() {
    // Adjust the color based on the brightness value
    setState(() {
      _adjustedColor = ColorAdjust.adjustBrightness(_originalColor, _brightness);
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Color Adjust Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Container(
              width: 100,
              height: 100,
              color: _adjustedColor, // Display the adjusted color
            ),
            Slider(
              value: _brightness,
              min: -1.0,
              max: 1.0,
              divisions: 20,
              label: 'Brightness: ${_brightness.toStringAsFixed(2)}',
              onChanged: (value) {
                _brightness = value; // Update brightness value
                _adjustColor(); // Adjust color when slider changes
              },
            ),
            Text('Adjust Brightness'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp and points to the ColorAdjustDemo widget.
// 3. ColorAdjustDemo is a stateful widget that maintains the original and adjusted colors.
// 4. The initState method initializes the adjusted color to the original color.
// 5. The _adjustColor method updates the adjusted color based on the brightness value.
// 6. The build method creates a UI with a container displaying the adjusted color, a slider to adjust brightness, and a label.
// 7. When the slider is moved, the onChanged callback updates the brightness value and calls _adjustColor to refresh the UI with the new color.
```
