// The app initializes the FlutterCallkitIncomingYoer package and sets up an event listener for incoming calls.
// When an incoming call is received, the app displays the call screen using the showCallScreen method.
// The call screen is displayed on top of the current app screen, allowing the user to answer or reject the call.
// The app uses the CallKit framework on iOS and the TelecomManager on Android to handle incoming calls.
// The app requires the necessary permissions to handle incoming calls, such as the READ_PHONE_STATE and CALL_PHONE permissions on Android.
// The app also requires a configuration file, such as the CallKit.plist file on iOS, to configure the CallKit framework.
