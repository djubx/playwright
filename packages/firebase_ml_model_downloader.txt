# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Firebase ML Model Downloader

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `firebase_ml_model_downloader` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `firebase_ml_model_downloader` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  firebase_ml_model_downloader: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Configure Firebase

### For Android

1. **Add Firebase to Your Android Project**:
   - Go to the Firebase Console and create a new project.
   - Add your Android app to the project and download the `google-services.json` file.
   - Place the `google-services.json` file in the `android/app` directory.

2. **Update `build.gradle` Files**:
   - In `android/build.gradle`, add the Google services classpath:

   ```groovy
   buildscript {
       dependencies {
           // Add this line
           classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.10'
       }
   }
   ```

   - In `android/app/build.gradle`, apply the Google services plugin:

   ```groovy
   apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
   ```

### For iOS

1. **Add Firebase to Your iOS Project**:
   - In the Firebase Console, add your iOS app and download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file.
   - Place the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file in the `ios/Runner` directory.

2. **Update `ios/Podfile`**:
   - Ensure your `Podfile` has the platform set to at least iOS 10:

   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

3. **Install Pods**:
   - Run the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   cd ios
   pod install
   ```

## Step 3: Initialize Firebase in Your App

In your `main.dart` file, initialize Firebase:

```dart
import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await Firebase.initializeApp();
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it to download and manage ML models. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to download a model:

```dart
import 'package:firebase_ml_model_downloader/firebase_ml_model_downloader.dart';

Future<void> downloadModel() async {
  try {
    // Specify the model name
    final modelName = 'your_model_name';
    
    // Download the model
    final model = await FirebaseModelDownloader.downloadModel(
      modelName,
      FirebaseModelDownloadType.localModel,
    );

    // Use the model
    print('Model downloaded: ${model.name}');
  } catch (e) {
    print('Error downloading model: $e');
  }
}
```

This function downloads a model specified by `modelName` and prints its name upon successful download.

With these steps, you are now ready to use the `firebase_ml_model_downloader` package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Using Firebase ML Model Downloader

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';
import 'package:firebase_ml_model_downloader/firebase_ml_model_downloader.dart';

void main() async {
  // Ensure Flutter binding is initialized
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  
  // Initialize Firebase
  await Firebase.initializeApp();
  
  // Run the app
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Firebase ML Model Downloader',
      home: ModelDownloaderScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ModelDownloaderScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ModelDownloaderScreenState createState() => _ModelDownloaderScreenState();
}

class _ModelDownloaderScreenState extends State<ModelDownloaderScreen> {
  String _modelStatus = 'Model not downloaded';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Download the model when the screen initializes
    downloadModel();
  }

  Future<void> downloadModel() async {
    try {
      // Specify the model name
      final modelName = 'your_model_name';
      
      // Download the model
      final model = await FirebaseModelDownloader.downloadModel(
        modelName,
        FirebaseModelDownloadType.localModel,
      );

      // Update the model status
      setState(() {
        _modelStatus = 'Model downloaded: ${model.name}';
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors during model download
      setState(() {
        _modelStatus = 'Error downloading model: $e';
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Firebase ML Model Downloader'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(_modelStatus), // Display the model status
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts by initializing Firebase in the main function.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. The ModelDownloaderScreen widget is displayed as the home screen.
// 4. In the ModelDownloaderScreen, the downloadModel function is called in initState.
// 5. The downloadModel function attempts to download the specified ML model.
// 6. If successful, the model's name is displayed; if an error occurs, the error message is shown.
```
