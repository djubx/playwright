# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Chips Choice

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the Chips Choice package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  chips_choice: ^2.0.0
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:chips_choice/chips_choice.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Chips Choice Widget

You can now use the `ChipsChoice` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
ChipsChoice<String>._(
  value: selectedOptions,
  onChanged: (val) => setState(() => selectedOptions = val),
  choiceItems: C2Choice.listFrom<String, String>(
    source: options,
    value: (i, v) => v,
    label: (i, v) => v,
  ),
)
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to create a Chips Choice widget that allows users to select multiple options from a predefined list.

## Step 5: Customizing the Chips

You can customize the appearance of the chips by using various properties such as `selectedColor`, `unselectedColor`, and `labelStyle`. For example:

```dart
ChipsChoice<String>.multiple(
  value: selectedOptions,
  onChanged: (val) => setState(() => selectedOptions = val),
  choiceItems: C2Choice.listFrom<String, String>(
    source: options,
    value: (i, v) => v,
    label: (i, v) => v,
  ),
  selectedColor: Colors.blue,
  unselectedColor: Colors.grey,
  labelStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
)
```

This customization allows you to create a visually appealing selection interface that fits your app's theme.

# Complete Example of Chips Choice in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:chips_choice/chips_choice.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Chips Choice Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // List of options to choose from
  List<String> options = ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3', 'Option 4'];
  
  // List to hold selected options
  List<String> selectedOptions = [];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Chips Choice Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ChipsChoice<String>.multiple(
          value: selectedOptions, // Current selected options
          onChanged: (val) => setState(() => selectedOptions = val), // Update state on change
          choiceItems: C2Choice.listFrom<String, String>(
            source: options, // Source of options
            value: (i, v) => v, // Value of each option
            label: (i, v) => v, // Label of each option
          ),
          selectedColor: Colors.blue, // Color for selected chips
          unselectedColor: Colors.grey, // Color for unselected chips
          labelStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.white), // Style for labels
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of selected options.
// 4. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a ChipsChoice widget in the center.
// 5. ChipsChoice displays multiple options from the 'options' list, allowing users to select multiple items.
// 6. When the user selects or deselects a chip, the onChanged callback updates the 'selectedOptions' state.
// 7. The selected chips are displayed in blue, while unselected chips are grey, providing clear visual feedback.
```
