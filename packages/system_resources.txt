Here's a detailed technical blog on the "system_resources" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# System Resources Flutter Package

The `system_resources` Flutter package is a powerful tool that allows developers to access various system-level resources and metrics within their Flutter applications. This package provides insights into the device's performance, including CPU usage, memory consumption, battery status, and more. 

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the `system_resources` package in scenarios such as:
- **Performance Monitoring**: To track the performance of your application in real-time and optimize resource usage.
- **Battery Management**: To monitor battery levels and optimize your app's performance based on battery status.
- **System Diagnostics**: To gather system information for debugging or analytics purposes.

## Features

- **CPU Usage**: Retrieve the current CPU usage percentage.
- **Memory Usage**: Access information about the app's memory consumption.
- **Battery Status**: Get real-time battery level and charging status.
- **Network Information**: Monitor network connectivity and data usage.

The `system_resources` package is essential for developers looking to create efficient and responsive applications that adapt to the device's current state.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the System Resources Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `system_resources` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  system_resources: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file. Add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BATTERY_STATS"/>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to add specific keys to your `Info.plist` file if you are accessing sensitive information. However, basic usage of the `system_resources` package does not require additional permissions.

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:system_resources/system_resources.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the package to access system resources. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to retrieve CPU usage and memory information:

```dart
void getSystemResources() async {
  double cpuUsage = await SystemResources.cpuUsage;
  double memoryUsage = await SystemResources.memoryUsage;

  print('CPU Usage: $cpuUsage%');
  print('Memory Usage: $memoryUsage MB');
}
```

This function retrieves the CPU and memory usage and prints them to the console.

## Step 5: Running the Application

After setting up the package and writing your code, run your Flutter application using:

```bash
flutter run
```

This will launch your app, and you should see the system resource metrics in the console.

With these steps, you are now ready to utilize the `system_resources` package in your Flutter applications!

# Complete Example of Using the System Resources Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:system_resources/system_resources.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  double _cpuUsage = 0.0; // Variable to hold CPU usage
  double _memoryUsage = 0.0; // Variable to hold Memory usage
  String _batteryStatus = ''; // Variable to hold Battery status

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _fetchSystemResources(); // Fetch system resources when the app starts
  }

  // Function to fetch system resources
  void _fetchSystemResources() async {
    // Get CPU usage
    _cpuUsage = await SystemResources.cpuUsage;
    // Get Memory usage
    _memoryUsage = await SystemResources.memoryUsage;
    // Get Battery status
    _batteryStatus = await SystemResources.batteryLevel;

    // Update the UI with the fetched data
    setState(() {});
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('System Resources Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text('CPU Usage: ${_cpuUsage.toStringAsFixed(2)}%'), // Display CPU usage
              Text('Memory Usage: ${_memoryUsage.toStringAsFixed(2)} MB'), // Display Memory usage
              Text('Battery Status: $_batteryStatus'), // Display Battery status
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of system resources.
// 3. In the initState() method, _fetchSystemResources() is called to retrieve system metrics.
// 4. The _fetchSystemResources() function asynchronously fetches CPU usage, memory usage, and battery status.
// 5. Once the data is fetched, setState() is called to update the UI with the new values.
// 6. The build method constructs the UI, displaying the CPU usage, memory usage, and battery status in a column.
```
