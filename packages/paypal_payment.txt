# Tutorial: Setting Up the PayPal Payment Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `paypal_payment` package and explain how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `paypal_payment` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  paypal_payment: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Configure for Android

For Android, you need to add the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

Additionally, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Configure for iOS

For iOS, you need to add the following to your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Initialize PayPal

Before you can use the PayPal payment functionality, you need to initialize it in your application. This is typically done in the `main.dart` file:

```dart
import 'package:paypal_payment/paypal_payment.dart';

void main() {
  PayPalPayment.initialize(
    clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
    secret: 'YOUR_SECRET',
    environment: PayPalEnvironment.Sandbox, // or PayPalEnvironment.Production
  );
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` and `YOUR_SECRET` with your actual PayPal credentials.

## Step 5: Using the Package

You can now use the package to create a payment button and handle payments. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a payment button:

```dart
PayPalPaymentButton(
  onPressed: () async {
    // Create a payment request
    var payment = PayPalPayment(
      amount: '10.00',
      currency: 'USD',
      description: 'Payment for services',
    );

    // Process the payment
    var result = await PayPalPayment.processPayment(payment);
    if (result.success) {
      // Handle successful payment
      print('Payment successful: ${result.transactionId}');
    } else {
      // Handle payment failure
      print('Payment failed: ${result.error}');
    }
  },
)
```

This button will initiate a payment when pressed, and you can handle the success or failure of the payment accordingly.

# Complete Example: PayPal Payment in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize PayPal with your credentials
  PayPalPayment.initialize(
    clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
    secret: 'YOUR_SECRET',
    environment: PayPalEnvironment.Sandbox, // Use Production for live payments
  );
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'PayPal Payment Example',
      home: PaymentScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PaymentScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('PayPal Payment'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: PayPalPaymentButton(
          onPressed: () async {
            // Create a payment request
            var payment = PayPalPayment(
              amount: '10.00', // Amount to be charged
              currency: 'USD', // Currency type
              description: 'Payment for services', // Description of the payment
            );

            // Process the payment
            var result = await PayPalPayment.processPayment(payment);
            if (result.success) {
              // Handle successful payment
              print('Payment successful: ${result.transactionId}');
              // Show success message to the user
              ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                SnackBar(content: Text('Payment successful! Transaction ID: ${result.transactionId}')),
              );
            } else {
              // Handle payment failure
              print('Payment failed: ${result.error}');
              // Show error message to the user
              ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                SnackBar(content: Text('Payment failed: ${result.error}')),
              );
            }
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app initializes the PayPal SDK with the provided client ID and secret.
// 2. The main screen displays a button for initiating a PayPal payment.
// 3. When the button is pressed, a payment request is created with the specified amount, currency, and description.
// 4. The payment is processed, and the result is checked for success or failure.
// 5. If successful, the transaction ID is printed and a success message is shown to the user.
// 6. If the payment fails, the error is printed and an error message is displayed to the user.
```
