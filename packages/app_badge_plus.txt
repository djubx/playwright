# Tutorial: Setting Up app_badge_plus

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `app_badge_plus` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `app_badge_plus` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  app_badge_plus: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/app_badge_plus).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `AndroidManifest.xml` located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Ensure you have the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `Info.plist` located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to enable badge notifications:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>fetch</string>
</array>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to set and clear badges.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:app_badge_plus/app_badge_plus.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('App Badge Plus Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  AppBadgePlus.setBadge(5); // Set badge count to 5
                },
                child: Text('Set Badge to 5'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  AppBadgePlus.clearBadge(); // Clear badge
                },
                child: Text('Clear Badge'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app with two buttons: one to set the badge count and another to clear it.

# Complete Example of app_badge_plus

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:app_badge_plus/app_badge_plus.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('App Badge Plus Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Set the badge count to 5
                  AppBadgePlus.setBadge(5);
                },
                child: Text('Set Badge to 5'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Clear the badge count
                  AppBadgePlus.clearBadge();
                },
                child: Text('Clear Badge'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange two ElevatedButtons vertically.
// 4. The first button, when pressed, calls AppBadgePlus.setBadge(5) to set the app badge count to 5.
// 5. The second button, when pressed, calls AppBadgePlus.clearBadge() to remove the badge count.
// 6. The app provides a simple interface for users to interact with badge notifications.
```
