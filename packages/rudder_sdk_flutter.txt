# Setting Up and Using rudder_sdk_flutter

## Installation
To get started with the `rudder_sdk_flutter` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  rudder_sdk_flutter: ^<latest_version>
```

Make sure to replace `<latest_version>` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/rudder_sdk_flutter).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure that you have the following configurations:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following:
   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. Ensure that your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:
   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

## Basic Usage
After installation and configuration, you can start using the package in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s how to initialize the Rudder SDK and track events:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:rudder_sdk_flutter/rudder_sdk_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Rudder SDK Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the Rudder SDK
    RudderClient.initialize(
      writeKey: 'YOUR_WRITE_KEY',
      dataPlaneUrl: 'https://your-data-plane-url',
    );
  }

  void _trackEvent() {
    // Track a sample event
    RudderClient.track(
      event: 'Button Clicked',
      properties: {'button_name': 'Sample Button'},
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Rudder SDK Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _trackEvent,
          child: Text('Track Event'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize the Rudder SDK with a write key and data plane URL. When the button is clicked, an event is tracked with the name "Button Clicked" and a property indicating which button was pressed.

# Complete Example of rudder_sdk_flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:rudder_sdk_flutter/rudder_sdk_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Rudder SDK Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the Rudder SDK with your write key and data plane URL
    RudderClient.initialize(
      writeKey: 'YOUR_WRITE_KEY', // Replace with your actual write key
      dataPlaneUrl: 'https://your-data-plane-url', // Replace with your data plane URL
    );
  }

  void _trackEvent() {
    // Track a sample event when the button is clicked
    RudderClient.track(
      event: 'Button Clicked', // Name of the event
      properties: {'button_name': 'Sample Button'}, // Additional properties for the event
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Rudder SDK Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _trackEvent, // Call the _trackEvent method on button press
          child: Text('Track Event'), // Button label
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. HomeScreen is a stateful widget that initializes the Rudder SDK in initState.
// 4. The Rudder SDK is initialized with a write key and data plane URL.
// 5. When the user presses the "Track Event" button, the _trackEvent method is called.
// 6. The _trackEvent method sends an event named "Button Clicked" to the Rudder SDK with additional properties.
// 7. The app displays a simple UI with a button that tracks events when clicked.
