## Setup Process

To get started with `webview_flutter_plus`, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  webview_flutter_plus: ^latest_version
```

Replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/webview_flutter_plus).

### Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

2. **Enable JavaScript**: You can enable JavaScript in your web view by setting it in the `WebView` options.

#### iOS

1. **Update Info.plist**: Add the following keys to your `Info.plist` to allow arbitrary loads:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. **Enable JavaScript**: Similar to Android, ensure JavaScript is enabled in your web view settings.

### Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:webview_flutter_plus/webview_flutter_plus.dart';
```

## Basic Usage

To use the `webview_flutter_plus` package, you can create a simple web view as follows:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('WebView Example'),
      ),
      body: WebViewPlus(
        initialUrl: 'https://flutter.dev',
        javascriptMode: JavascriptMode.unrestricted,
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code creates a basic web view that loads the Flutter website and allows unrestricted JavaScript execution.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:webview_flutter_plus/webview_flutter_plus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// Main application widget
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'WebView Flutter Plus Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: WebViewScreen(),
    );
  }
}

// Screen containing the WebView
class WebViewScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _WebViewScreenState createState() => _WebViewScreenState();
}

class _WebViewScreenState extends State<WebViewScreen> {
  late WebViewPlusController _controller; // Controller for the WebView

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('WebView Example'),
        actions: [
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.refresh), // Refresh button
            onPressed: () {
              _controller.reload(); // Reload the web page
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
      body: WebViewPlus(
        initialUrl: 'https://flutter.dev', // Initial URL to load
        javascriptMode: JavascriptMode.unrestricted, // Allow JavaScript
        onWebViewCreated: (WebViewPlusController controller) {
          _controller = controller; // Initialize the controller
        },
        onPageFinished: (String url) {
          print('Page finished loading: $url'); // Log when the page finishes loading
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application flow explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home of the app is set to WebViewScreen.
// 4. WebViewScreen creates a WebViewPlus widget that loads the Flutter website.
// 5. The app bar contains a refresh button that reloads the web page when pressed.
// 6. The WebViewPlusController is used to control the web view, allowing for actions like reloading the page.
// 7. The onPageFinished callback logs the URL of the page once it has finished loading.
```
