<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Isolated Download Manager Flutter Package

The `isolated_download_manager_flutter` package is a powerful tool for managing downloads in Flutter applications. It provides a robust and efficient way to handle file downloads in an isolated environment, ensuring that the main UI thread remains responsive. This package is particularly useful for applications that require downloading large files or multiple files simultaneously without affecting the user experience.

## When to Use This Package

- **Large File Downloads**: If your application needs to download large files (e.g., videos, images, or documents), this package can handle the download process in the background.
- **Multiple Concurrent Downloads**: For applications that require downloading multiple files at once, this package can manage these downloads efficiently.
- **Responsive UI**: When you want to ensure that your app's UI remains responsive while downloads are in progress, using an isolated download manager is essential.

## Features

- **Isolated Downloads**: Runs downloads in a separate isolate, preventing UI thread blocking.
- **Progress Tracking**: Provides real-time progress updates for ongoing downloads.
- **Error Handling**: Includes mechanisms for handling download errors and retries.
- **Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Isolated Download Manager

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `isolated_download_manager_flutter` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `isolated_download_manager_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  isolated_download_manager_flutter: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save downloaded files.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera for scanning QR codes.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for voice recording.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to initiate a download and track its progress.

# Complete Example of Using Isolated Download Manager

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:isolated_download_manager_flutter/isolated_download_manager_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Isolated Download Manager Example',
      home: DownloadPage(),
    );
  }
}

class DownloadPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DownloadPageState createState() => _DownloadPageState();
}

class _DownloadPageState extends State<DownloadPage> {
  late DownloadManager _downloadManager; // Declare the download manager
  double _progress = 0.0; // Variable to track download progress

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _downloadManager = DownloadManager(); // Initialize the download manager
  }

  // Function to start the download
  void _startDownload() async {
    String url = 'https://example.com/largefile.zip'; // URL of the file to download
    String filePath = '/path/to/save/largefile.zip'; // Path to save the downloaded file

    // Start the download and listen for progress updates
    _downloadManager.download(url, filePath).listen((event) {
      setState(() {
        _progress = event.progress; // Update the progress variable
      });
    }, onDone: () {
      // Handle completion
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Download completed!')),
      );
    }, onError: (error) {
      // Handle errors
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Download failed: $error')),
      );
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Download Manager Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Download Progress: ${(_progress * 100).toStringAsFixed(0)}%'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _startDownload, // Start download on button press
              child: Text('Start Download'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The DownloadPage widget is displayed, which contains the UI for downloading files.
// 3. When the "Start Download" button is pressed, the _startDownload function is called.
// 4. The download manager initiates the download and listens for progress updates.
// 5. As the download progresses, the UI is updated to reflect the current progress.
// 6. Upon completion or error, a SnackBar message is displayed to inform the user.
```
