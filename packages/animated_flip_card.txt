```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_flip_card/flip_card.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Animated Flip Card Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: FlipCard(
            // Create a flip card with a front and back side
            front: Container(
              width: 200,
              height: 200,
              color: Colors.blue,
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'Front',
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.white),
                ),
              ),
            ),
            back: Container(
              width: 200,
              height: 200,
              color: Colors.red,
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'Back',
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.white),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and sees a flip card with a blue front side and a red back side.
// 2. The user can tap on the flip card to flip it over and see the other side.
// 3. The flip animation is smooth and seamless, providing a good user experience.
// 4. The app uses the `animated_flip_card` package to create the flip card and animation.
// 5. The app is built using Flutter and runs on both Android and iOS platforms.

// In summary, the code flows as follows:
// The `RealFlutter` class creates a `MaterialApp` with a `Scaffold` and an `AppBar`.
// The `Scaffold` contains a `Center` widget with a `FlipCard` widget.
// The `FlipCard` widget has a front and back side, each with a `Container` and a `Text` widget.
// The user can tap on the flip card to flip it over and see the other side.
