# Tutorial: Setting Up the Vimeo Video Player

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `vimeo_video_player` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `vimeo_video_player` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  vimeo_video_player: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/vimeo_video_player).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions to allow video playback:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:vimeo_video_player/vimeo_video_player.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Vimeo Video Player

You can now use the `VimeoVideoPlayer` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:vimeo_video_player/vimeo_video_player.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late VimeoVideoPlayerController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the Vimeo video player controller with a video ID
    _controller = VimeoVideoPlayerController.network(
      'https://vimeo.com/your_video_id',
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the controller when the widget is removed from the widget tree
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Vimeo Video Player')),
      body: Center(
        child: VimeoVideoPlayer(_controller),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple app that plays a Vimeo video. The `VimeoVideoPlayerController` is initialized with the video URL, and the player is displayed in the center of the screen.

# Complete Example of Vimeo Video Player

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:vimeo_video_player/vimeo_video_player.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late VimeoVideoPlayerController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the Vimeo video player controller with a video ID
    _controller = VimeoVideoPlayerController.network(
      'https://vimeo.com/your_video_id', // Replace with your Vimeo video URL
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the controller when the widget is removed from the widget tree
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Vimeo Video Player')),
      body: Center(
        child: VimeoVideoPlayer(_controller), // Display the video player
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          // Toggle play/pause when the button is pressed
          if (_controller.value.isPlaying) {
            _controller.pause(); // Pause the video
          } else {
            _controller.play(); // Play the video
          }
          setState(() {}); // Update the UI
        },
        child: Icon(
          _controller.value.isPlaying ? Icons.pause : Icons.play_arrow,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the initState method, we initialize the VimeoVideoPlayerController with a video URL.
// 3. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget containing the Vimeo video player.
// 4. A FloatingActionButton is provided to toggle play and pause functionality.
// 5. When the button is pressed, it checks if the video is currently playing and either pauses or plays the video accordingly.
// 6. The UI is updated to reflect the current state of the video playback.
```
