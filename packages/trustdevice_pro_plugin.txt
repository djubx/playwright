# TrustDevice Pro Plugin: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To add the `trustdevice_pro_plugin` to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  trustdevice_pro_plugin: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/trustdevice_pro_plugin).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // or higher
    }
}
```

2. Add the necessary permissions in the `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. Ensure your deployment target is set to iOS 10.0 or higher in your `ios/Podfile`.

## Basic Usage
To use the `trustdevice_pro_plugin`, you need to initialize it and call its methods to authenticate the device. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:trustdevice_pro_plugin/trustdevice_pro_plugin.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _status = "Unknown";

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _checkDeviceTrust();
  }

  Future<void> _checkDeviceTrust() async {
    bool isTrusted = await TrustDeviceProPlugin.isDeviceTrusted();
    setState(() {
      _status = isTrusted ? "Device is trusted" : "Device is not trusted";
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("TrustDevice Pro Example")),
      body: Center(child: Text(_status)),
    );
  }
}
```

This code initializes the plugin and checks if the device is trusted when the app starts.

# Complete Example of TrustDevice Pro Plugin

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:trustdevice_pro_plugin/trustdevice_pro_plugin.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _status = "Unknown"; // Variable to hold the trust status of the device

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState(); // Call the superclass's initState
    _checkDeviceTrust(); // Check device trust status on initialization
  }

  // Method to check if the device is trusted
  Future<void> _checkDeviceTrust() async {
    bool isTrusted = await TrustDeviceProPlugin.isDeviceTrusted(); // Call the plugin method
    setState(() {
      _status = isTrusted ? "Device is trusted" : "Device is not trusted"; // Update the status based on the result
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("TrustDevice Pro Example")), // App bar with title
      body: Center(child: Text(_status)), // Display the trust status in the center
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and the RealFlutter widget is created.
// 2. The initState method is called, which triggers the _checkDeviceTrust method.
// 3. The _checkDeviceTrust method calls the TrustDeviceProPlugin to check if the device is trusted.
// 4. Based on the result, the _status variable is updated.
// 5. The UI is rebuilt to display whether the device is trusted or not.
