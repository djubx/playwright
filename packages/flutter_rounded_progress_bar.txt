# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_rounded_progress_bar

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_rounded_progress_bar` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_rounded_progress_bar: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the platform version in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the `RoundedProgressBar` in your widget tree.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_rounded_progress_bar/flutter_rounded_progress_bar.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Rounded Progress Bar Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: RoundedProgressBar(
            height: 20,
            style: RoundedProgressBarStyle(
              colorProgress: Colors.blue,
              colorBackground: Colors.grey[300],
              borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(10),
            ),
            borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(10),
            percent: 70, // Set the progress percentage
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays a rounded progress bar with a 70% completion rate. You can customize the colors and height as needed.

# Complete Example of flutter_rounded_progress_bar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_rounded_progress_bar/flutter_rounded_progress_bar.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  double _progress = 0; // Variable to hold the progress value

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _startProgress(); // Start the progress when the widget is initialized
  }

  // Function to simulate progress over time
  void _startProgress() {
    Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1), () {
      if (_progress < 100) {
        setState(() {
          _progress += 10; // Increment progress by 10%
        });
        _startProgress(); // Call the function recursively
      }
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Rounded Progress Bar Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Display the rounded progress bar
              RoundedProgressBar(
                height: 20,
                style: RoundedProgressBarStyle(
                  colorProgress: Colors.blue,
                  colorBackground: Colors.grey[300],
                  borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(10),
                ),
                borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(10),
                percent: _progress, // Bind the progress variable
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Display the current progress percentage
              Text('Progress: ${_progress.toStringAsFixed(0)}%'),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation

// The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` widget.
// The `RealFlutter` widget is a stateful widget that manages the progress state.
// In the `initState` method, we call `_startProgress` to begin updating the progress.
// The `_startProgress` function uses a delayed future to increment the progress by 10% every second.
// When the progress reaches 100%, the function stops calling itself.
// The `build` method returns a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing a rounded progress bar and a text widget displaying the current progress percentage.
// The `RoundedProgressBar` widget visually represents the progress, and the text widget shows the numerical value of the progress.
