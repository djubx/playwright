# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Panara Dialogs

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the Panara Dialogs package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  panara_dialogs: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using Panara Dialogs

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement an alert dialog.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:panara_dialogs/panara_dialogs.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Panara Dialogs Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              PanaraAlertDialog.show(
                context,
                title: 'Alert',
                message: 'This is an alert dialog.',
                buttonText: 'OK',
                onTap: () {
                  Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                },
              );
            },
            child: Text('Show Alert'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, an alert dialog is displayed with a title, message, and an "OK" button to dismiss the dialog.

                    },
                  );
                },
                child: Text('Show Alert'),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Add space between buttons
              // Button to show a confirmation dialog
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Show confirmation dialog when button is pressed
                  PanaraAlertDialog.show(
                    context,
                    title: 'Confirm Action',
                    message: 'Are you sure you want to proceed?',
                    buttonText: 'Yes',
                    onTap: () {
                      // Action to perform on confirmation
                      Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                    },
                  );
                },
                child: Text('Show Confirmation'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which builds a MaterialApp.
// 2. The Scaffold widget provides a structure with an AppBar and a body.
// 3. In the body, a Center widget aligns its children in the center of the screen.
// 4. Two ElevatedButtons are created:
//    - The first button shows an alert dialog when pressed.
//    - The second button shows a confirmation dialog when pressed.
// 5. Each dialog is created using the PanaraAlertDialog.show method, which takes parameters for title, message, button text, and an onTap callback to handle button presses.
// 6. The dialogs can be dismissed by calling Navigator.of(context).pop() in the onTap callback.
