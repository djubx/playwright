# Setting Up leancode_lint

To get started with the `leancode_lint` package, follow these steps:

## Installation

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `leancode_lint` package under `dev_dependencies`:

   ```yaml
   dev_dependencies:
     leancode_lint: ^latest_version
   ```

   Replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/leancode_lint).

2. **Run Flutter Packages Get**: After saving the changes, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Configuration

1. **Create a Configuration File**: Create a file named `analysis_options.yaml` in the root of your Flutter project. This file will contain the linting rules you want to enforce. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

   ```yaml
   include: package:leancode_lint/analysis_options.yaml
   ```

2. **Platform-Specific Details**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your Android project is set up to use the latest Gradle version. This is usually handled automatically by Flutter, but you can check your `android/build.gradle` file for compatibility.
   - **iOS**: Make sure your iOS project is using the latest Xcode version. You can check this in your Xcode settings.

3. **Run Analysis**: To run the linting analysis, use the following command:

   ```bash
   flutter analyze
   ```

This command will analyze your codebase and provide feedback based on the rules defined in your `analysis_options.yaml` file.

By following these steps, you can effectively set up and start using the `leancode_lint` package in your Flutter projects.

# Complete Example of leancode_lint

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // The main widget of the application
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Leancode Lint Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Scaffold provides a structure for the visual interface
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Leancode Lint Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Welcome to Leancode Lint!',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action when button is pressed
                showDialog(
                  context: context,
                  builder: (BuildContext context) {
                    return AlertDialog(
                      title: Text('Hello!'),
                      content: Text('This is a linting example.'),
                      actions: <Widget>[
                        TextButton(
                          child: Text('Close'),
                          onPressed: () {
                            Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                          },
                        ),
                      ],
                    );
                  },
                );
              },
              child: Text('Show Dialog'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp sets up the app's title, theme, and home page.
// 4. MyHomePage is another StatelessWidget that builds the main UI.
// 5. The UI consists of a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 6. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the text and button.
// 7. When the button is pressed, a dialog is shown with a message and a close button.
// 8. The close button dismisses the dialog when pressed.

### Summary of the Code Flow
The provided code demonstrates a simple Flutter application that integrates the `leancode_lint` package. The application starts with the `main` function, which initializes the app by calling `runApp` with the `RealFlutter` widget. The `RealFlutter` widget sets up the `MaterialApp`, defining the app's title and theme, and specifies `MyHomePage` as the home screen.

The `MyHomePage` widget builds the main user interface, which includes an `AppBar` and a centered column containing a welcome message and a button. When the button is pressed, an alert dialog is displayed, showcasing how user interactions can be handled in the app. The dialog can be dismissed by pressing the close button.

This example illustrates the basic structure of a Flutter app while adhering to the linting rules provided by the `leancode_lint` package, ensuring code quality and maintainability.
