In summary, the code flows as follows:

1.  The user types in the text field, triggering the `onChanged` callback.
2.  The `AutocompleteLabel` widget displays a list of suggestions based on the user's input.
3.  The user selects a suggestion from the list, which updates the text field.
4.  The `onChanged` callback is triggered again, allowing the application to handle the updated text.

This code demonstrates the usage of the `flutter_autocomplete_label` package and provides a basic example of how to implement an autocomplete feature in a Flutter application.
