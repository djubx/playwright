// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user enters their email and password in the form fields.
// 2. When the user submits the form, the `validate` method is called on each field.
// 3. The `validate` method checks the user input against the validation rules defined in the `Validator` instance.
// 4. If the user input is invalid, an error message is displayed below the field.
// 5. If the user input is valid, the form is submitted and the application proceeds with the next step.

// In this example, we use the `EmailRule` and `PasswordRule` to validate the user's email and password.
// We also use the `Validator` instance to define the validation rules and to validate the user input.
// The `validate` method returns a list of errors, which we use to display error messages to the user.
