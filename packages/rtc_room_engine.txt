# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using rtc_room_engine

## Installation
To get started with the `rtc_room_engine` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  rtc_room_engine: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/rtc_room_engine).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure you have the following configurations:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
   ```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys for permissions:
   ```xml
   <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your camera for video calls.</string>
   <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your microphone for audio calls.</string>
   ```

## Basic Usage
Once you have installed the package and configured your project, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initialize the `RealFlutter` class and join a room.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:rtc_room_engine/rtc_room_engine.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late RtcRoomEngine _rtcRoomEngine;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _rtcRoomEngine = RtcRoomEngine();
    _rtcRoomEngine.initialize();
  }

  void joinRoom(String roomId) {
    _rtcRoomEngine.joinRoom(roomId);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('RTC Room Engine Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () => joinRoom('exampleRoomId'),
          child: Text('Join Room'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code initializes the `RtcRoomEngine` and provides a button to join a room. You can expand this example to include more features such as handling video streams and user interactions.

# Complete Example of Using rtc_room_engine

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:rtc_room_engine/rtc_room_engine.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late RtcRoomEngine _rtcRoomEngine; // Declare the RTC Room Engine instance
  String _roomId = 'exampleRoomId'; // Room ID for joining

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _rtcRoomEngine = RtcRoomEngine(); // Initialize the RTC Room Engine
    _rtcRoomEngine.initialize(); // Call the initialize method
  }

  // Method to join a room
  void joinRoom() {
    _rtcRoomEngine.joinRoom(_roomId); // Join the specified room
  }

  // Method to leave the room
  void leaveRoom() {
    _rtcRoomEngine.leaveRoom(); // Leave the current room
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('RTC Room Engine Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: joinRoom, // Join room button
              child: Text('Join Room'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: leaveRoom, // Leave room button
              child: Text('Leave Room'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the initState method, we initialize the RtcRoomEngine instance.
// 3. The user can join a room by pressing the "Join Room" button, which calls the joinRoom method.
// 4. The joinRoom method uses the RtcRoomEngine instance to join the specified room.
// 5. The user can leave the room by pressing the "Leave Room" button, which calls the leaveRoom method.
// 6. The leaveRoom method uses the RtcRoomEngine instance to leave the current room.
