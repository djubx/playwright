# Back Button Interceptor Flutter Package

The `back_button_interceptor` package for Flutter is a powerful tool that allows developers to intercept the back button press events on both Android and iOS platforms. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to control the navigation flow of your application, such as when you need to confirm user actions before navigating away from a screen or when you want to prevent users from accidentally exiting the app.

## When to Use This Package

- **Confirmation Dialogs**: If you want to show a confirmation dialog when the user attempts to leave a screen.
- **Preventing Accidental Exits**: To prevent users from accidentally closing the app or navigating back when they are in the middle of a critical task.
- **Custom Navigation Logic**: When you need to implement custom navigation logic that deviates from the default back button behavior.

## Features

- **Easy Integration**: Simple API to intercept back button presses.
- **Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Custom Callbacks**: Allows you to define custom actions when the back button is pressed.

By using this package, you can enhance the user experience by providing more control over navigation and ensuring that users do not lose their progress unintentionally.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Back Button Interceptor

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `back_button_interceptor` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  back_button_interceptor: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:back_button_interceptor/back_button_interceptor.dart';
```

## Step 3: Setting Up the Interceptor

You need to set up the back button interceptor in your widget. This is typically done in the `initState` method of your StatefulWidget. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```dart
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  // Add the back button interceptor
  BackButtonInterceptor.add(myInterceptor);
}

@override
void dispose() {
  // Remove the back button interceptor when the widget is disposed
  BackButtonInterceptor.remove(myInterceptor);
  super.dispose();
}

// Define the interceptor function
bool myInterceptor(bool stopDefaultButtonEvent) {
  // Show a confirmation dialog or perform any action
  // Return true to stop the default back button behavior
  return true; // Change this based on your logic
}
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

On Android, the back button is a hardware button, and this package intercepts the event before it reaches the default behavior. Ensure that your app's navigation logic is well-defined to avoid confusion.

### iOS

On iOS, the back button is typically represented by a navigation bar button. The `back_button_interceptor` package will also intercept this event, allowing you to implement custom behavior.

## Step 4: Testing the Interceptor

Run your application on an emulator or a physical device. When you press the back button, the interceptor will trigger, allowing you to implement your custom logic.

By following these steps, you can effectively use the `back_button_interceptor` package to manage back button behavior in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Back Button Interceptor

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:back_button_interceptor/back_button_interceptor.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Adding the back button interceptor
    BackButtonInterceptor.add(myInterceptor);
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Removing the back button interceptor
    BackButtonInterceptor.remove(myInterceptor);
    super.dispose();
  }

  // Interceptor function to handle back button press
  bool myInterceptor(bool stopDefaultButtonEvent) {
    // Show a confirmation dialog when back button is pressed
    showDialog(
      context: context,
      builder: (BuildContext context) {
        return AlertDialog(
          title: Text("Confirm Exit"),
          content: Text("Do you really want to exit the app?"),
          actions: <Widget>[
            TextButton(
              child: Text("Cancel"),
              onPressed: () {
                Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
              },
            ),
            TextButton(
              child: Text("Exit"),
              onPressed: () {
                Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                // Exit the app
                // Note: This is not recommended for production apps
                // Use SystemNavigator.pop() for a better user experience
                SystemNavigator.pop();
              },
            ),
          ],
        );
      },
    );
    // Returning true to stop the default back button behavior
    return true;
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text("Back Button Interceptor Example"),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text("Press the back button to see the interceptor in action."),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget, we set up a back button interceptor in the initState method.
// 3. When the back button is pressed, the myInterceptor function is called.
// 4. Inside myInterceptor, a confirmation dialog is shown to the user.
// 5. If the user chooses to exit, the app will close; otherwise, the dialog will close, and the user will remain in the app.
// 6. The interceptor is removed in the dispose method to prevent memory leaks.
