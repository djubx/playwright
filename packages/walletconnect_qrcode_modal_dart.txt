# Tutorial: Setting Up WalletConnect QR Code Modal Dart

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `walletconnect_qrcode_modal_dart` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

First, add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  walletconnect_qrcode_modal_dart: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/walletconnect_qrcode_modal_dart).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. Ensure you have the correct deployment target set in `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0' # Ensure this is set to at least 10.0
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the QR code modal.

# Complete Example of WalletConnect QR Code Modal Dart

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:walletconnect_qrcode_modal_dart/walletconnect_qrcode_modal_dart.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'WalletConnect Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('WalletConnect QR Code Modal'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () async {
            // Create a WalletConnect instance
            final connector = WalletConnect(
              bridge: 'https://bridge.walletconnect.org', // WalletConnect bridge URL
              clientMeta: const PeerMeta(
                name: 'RealFlutter App',
                description: 'A Flutter app using WalletConnect',
                url: 'https://example.com',
                icons: ['https://example.com/icon.png'],
              ),
            );

            // Check if the connector is already connected
            if (!connector.connected) {
              // Display the QR code modal
              await showWalletConnectQRCodeModal(
                context: context,
                connector: connector,
              );
            }

            // After connection, you can use the connector to send transactions or messages
            // Example: await connector.sendTransaction(...);
          },
          child: Text('Connect Wallet'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application that integrates the WalletConnect QR Code Modal.
// 
// 1. **Main Function**: The `main` function initializes the app by running the `RealFlutter` widget.
// 2. **RealFlutter Class**: This is the main widget of the application, setting up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. **HomePage Class**: This widget contains a button that, when pressed, initiates the WalletConnect process.
// 4. **WalletConnect Instance**: A new instance of `WalletConnect` is created with the bridge URL and client metadata.
// 5. **Connection Check**: Before displaying the QR code modal, the app checks if the connector is already connected.
// 6. **Show QR Code Modal**: If not connected, it shows the QR code modal for the user to scan with their wallet.
// 7. **Post-Connection**: After the connection is established, you can use the `connector` to send transactions or messages to the connected wallet.
