# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Zoom Pinch Overlay Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `zoom_pinch_overlay` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  zoom_pinch_overlay: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable the `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` in your `Info.plist` file if you plan to access the photo library:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to the photo library.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `zoom_pinch_overlay` in your app.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:zoom_pinch_overlay/zoom_pinch_overlay.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Zoom Pinch Overlay Example',
      home: ZoomOverlayExample(),
    );
  }
}

class ZoomOverlayExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Zoom Pinch Overlay Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ZoomOverlay(
          // The widget to be zoomed
          child: Image.network(
            'https://example.com/sample-image.jpg', // Replace with your image URL
            fit: BoxFit.cover,
          ),
          // Optional: Overlay widget
          overlay: Container(
            color: Colors.black54,
            child: Center(
              child: Text(
                'Zoomable Image',
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget.
// 3. The home widget is ZoomOverlayExample, which contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. Inside the body, a ZoomOverlay widget is created, which wraps an Image widget.
// 5. The Image widget loads an image from a network URL and fits it to cover the available space.
// 6. An optional overlay is provided, which displays a semi-transparent black container with a centered text label.
// 7. Users can pinch to zoom and pan around the image, while the overlay remains visible.
