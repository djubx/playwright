# Overview of the queue_it Flutter Package

The `queue_it` Flutter package is designed to help developers manage user traffic effectively by implementing a virtual waiting room. This package is particularly useful for applications that experience high traffic during specific events, such as ticket sales, product launches, or limited-time offers. By using `queue_it`, developers can ensure a smooth user experience by controlling the flow of users to their application, preventing server overload and maintaining performance.

## When to Use `queue_it`
- **High Traffic Events**: When you anticipate a surge in users, such as during a concert ticket sale.
- **Limited Resources**: If your backend can only handle a certain number of concurrent users.
- **User Experience**: To provide a better experience by managing user expectations with a waiting room.

## Key Features
- **Customizable Waiting Room**: Allows developers to customize the waiting room experience.
- **Real-time Updates**: Users receive real-time updates on their queue status.
- **Analytics Integration**: Provides insights into user behavior and traffic patterns.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.

The `queue_it` package is a powerful tool for any Flutter developer looking to manage user traffic effectively and enhance the overall user experience during peak times.

# Setting Up and Using the queue_it Package

## Installation
To add the `queue_it` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  queue_it: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run the following command to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add any necessary permissions or configurations required by the `queue_it` package.

## Basic Usage
To use the `queue_it` package, you will typically initialize it in your main application file and manage the queue state. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set it up:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:queue_it/queue_it.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Queue It Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  QueueIt queueIt;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    queueIt = QueueIt();
    queueIt.startQueue();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Queue It Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('You are in the queue!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code initializes the `queue_it` package and starts the queue when the application is launched. The user will see a simple message indicating they are in the queue.

# Complete Example of the queue_it Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:queue_it/queue_it.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// Main application widget
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Queue It Example',
      home: RealFlutter(), // Entry point for the queue management
    );
  }
}

// Stateful widget to manage the queue
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  QueueIt queueIt; // Instance of the QueueIt class

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    queueIt = QueueIt(); // Initialize the queue
    queueIt.startQueue(); // Start the queue process
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Queue It Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: StreamBuilder<QueueStatus>(
          stream: queueIt.queueStatusStream, // Listen to queue status updates
          builder: (context, snapshot) {
            if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
              return CircularProgressIndicator(); // Show loading indicator while waiting
            } else if (snapshot.hasData) {
              // Display queue status
              return Text('Your position in the queue: ${snapshot.data.position}');
            } else {
              return Text('Error retrieving queue status');
            }
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `MyApp` widget.
2. `MyApp` builds the main MaterialApp and sets `RealFlutter` as the home widget.
3. In `RealFlutter`, the `initState` method initializes the `QueueIt` instance and starts the queue.
4. The `StreamBuilder` listens for updates on the queue status and rebuilds the UI accordingly.
5. If the queue status is loading, a CircularProgressIndicator is shown.
6. Once the queue status is available, it displays the user's position in the queue.
7. If there's an error, it shows an error message.
