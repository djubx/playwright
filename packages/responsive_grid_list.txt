# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Responsive Grid List Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `responsive_grid_list` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  responsive_grid_list: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the responsive grid list, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:responsive_grid_list/responsive_grid_list.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Responsive Grid List

You can now use the `ResponsiveGridList` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:responsive_grid_list/responsive_grid_list.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Responsive Grid List Example')),
        body: ResponsiveGridList(
          horizontalGridSpacing: 10,
          verticalGridSpacing: 10,
          minItemWidth: 100,
          children: List.generate(20, (index) {
            return Container(
              color: Colors.blue,
              child: Center(child: Text('Item $index')),
            );
          }),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

### Platform-Specific Details

- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 for compatibility with the latest Flutter packages.
  
- **iOS**: Make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile` to at least 10.0.

### Optimizations

- Use `const` constructors where possible to improve performance.
- Consider using `ListView` or `GridView` in combination with `ResponsiveGridList` for better performance when dealing with a large number of items.

# Complete Example of Responsive Grid List

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:responsive_grid_list/responsive_grid_list.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Responsive Grid List Example')),
        body: ResponsiveGridList(
          // Set horizontal spacing between grid items
          horizontalGridSpacing: 10,
          // Set vertical spacing between grid items
          verticalGridSpacing: 10,
          // Minimum width for each item in the grid
          minItemWidth: 100,
          // Generate a list of 20 items
          children: List.generate(20, (index) {
            return Container(
              // Set the background color of each item
              color: Colors.blue,
              // Center the text within the item
              child: Center(child: Text('Item $index')),
            );
          }),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The main function is the entry point of the application
void main() {
  // Run the RealFlutter app
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a ResponsiveGridList.
3. The ResponsiveGridList widget is configured with horizontal and vertical spacing, as well as a minimum item width.
4. A list of 20 items is generated, each represented by a blue container with centered text.
5. The grid layout automatically adjusts the number of columns based on the screen size, providing a responsive design.
