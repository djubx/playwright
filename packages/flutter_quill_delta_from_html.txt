// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app, and the RealFlutterApp widget is created.
// 2. The RealFlutterApp widget builds the RealFlutterHomePage widget.
// 3. The RealFlutterHomePage widget creates a QuillController instance and initializes it with basic settings.
// 4. The RealFlutterHomePage widget builds the QuillEditor widget, passing the QuillController instance and the converted Delta content.
// 5. The QuillEditor widget displays the converted Delta content and allows the user to edit it.

// In summary, this code demonstrates how to use the flutter_quill_delta_from_html package to convert HTML content to Quill Delta format and display it in a QuillEditor widget for editing.
