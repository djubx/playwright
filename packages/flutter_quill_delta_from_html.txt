# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_quill_delta_from_html

## Installation
To get started with the `flutter_quill_delta_from_html` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_quill_delta_from_html: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_quill_delta_from_html).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` if your app requires internet access to fetch HTML content.

## Using the Package
Once the package is installed, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to convert HTML to Delta format.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_quill_delta_from_html/flutter_quill_delta_from_html.dart';
```

2. Use the `htmlToDelta` function to convert HTML to Delta:

```dart
String htmlContent = "<h1>Hello World</h1><p>This is a paragraph.</p>";
Delta delta = htmlToDelta(htmlContent);
```

This will convert the provided HTML string into a Delta object that can be used with Quill editors.

# Complete Example of Using flutter_quill_delta_from_html

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_quill_delta_from_html/flutter_quill_delta_from_html.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Quill Delta from HTML Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('HTML to Delta Converter'),
        ),
        body: HtmlToDeltaConverter(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class HtmlToDeltaConverter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HtmlToDeltaConverterState createState() => _HtmlToDeltaConverterState();
}

class _HtmlToDeltaConverterState extends State<HtmlToDeltaConverter> {
  String htmlContent = "<h1>Hello World</h1><p>This is a paragraph.</p>";
  Delta? delta;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Convert HTML to Delta when the widget is initialized
    delta = htmlToDelta(htmlContent);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(
      child: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: [
          Text('HTML Content:'),
          Text(htmlContent),
          SizedBox(height: 20),
          Text('Converted Delta:'),
          Text(delta.toJson().toString()), // Display the Delta JSON
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the app and initializes the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The HtmlToDeltaConverter widget is created, which manages the conversion.
// 4. In the initState method, the HTML content is converted to Delta format.
// 5. The build method displays the original HTML content and the converted Delta JSON.
// 6. The app shows both the HTML and the resulting Delta, allowing users to see the conversion in action.
