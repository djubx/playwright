            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a rating bar and a text display showing the current rating.
// 2. The user can tap on the rating bar to change the rating.
// 3. When the user taps on the rating bar, the ratingCallback function is called with the new rating value.
// 4. The ratingCallback function updates the _rating variable with the new rating value.
// 5. The setState function is called to rebuild the UI with the new rating value.
// 6. The UI is rebuilt, and the new rating value is displayed in the text display.
