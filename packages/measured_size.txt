Here's a detailed technical blog on the "measured_size" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Measured Size Flutter Package

The **measured_size** package in Flutter is a powerful tool that allows developers to measure the size of widgets after they have been rendered. This capability is particularly useful in scenarios where the layout of a widget depends on its size, such as when creating dynamic layouts or animations that require precise measurements.

## When to Use

You might want to use the **measured_size** package in the following scenarios:

- **Dynamic Layouts**: When you need to adjust the layout based on the size of a widget, such as in responsive designs.
- **Animations**: When animating widgets that require knowledge of their size to create smooth transitions.
- **Custom Widgets**: When building custom widgets that need to adapt based on their content size.

## Features

- **Size Measurement**: Easily obtain the width and height of a widget after it has been rendered.
- **Callback Functionality**: Execute a callback function with the measured size, allowing for immediate updates to the UI or layout.
- **Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with both Android and iOS platforms.

Overall, the **measured_size** package is an essential tool for Flutter developers looking to create responsive and dynamic user interfaces.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Measured Size

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **measured_size** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  measured_size: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:measured_size/measured_size.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using MeasuredSize Widget

The **measured_size** package provides a `MeasuredSize` widget that you can wrap around any widget you want to measure. Hereâ€™s how to use it:

### Example Code

```dart
MeasuredSize(
  onChange: (Size size) {
    // This callback will be called with the size of the widget
    print('Width: ${size.width}, Height: ${size.height}');
  },
  child: YourWidget(), // Replace with your actual widget
)
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Optimizations

- **Performance**: Use the `MeasuredSize` widget judiciously, as measuring sizes can be performance-intensive if used excessively in a widget tree.
- **State Management**: Consider using state management solutions like Provider or Riverpod to manage the state that depends on the measured sizes.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the **measured_size** package effectively in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Measured Size

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:measured_size/measured_size.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Measured Size Example',
      home: MeasuredSizeExample(),
    );
  }
}

class MeasuredSizeExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MeasuredSizeExampleState createState() => _MeasuredSizeExampleState();
}

class _MeasuredSizeExampleState extends State<MeasuredSizeExample> {
  double _width = 0; // Variable to hold the measured width
  double _height = 0; // Variable to hold the measured height

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Measured Size Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // MeasuredSize widget to measure the size of the child widget
            MeasuredSize(
              onChange: (Size size) {
                // Update the state with the new size
                setState(() {
                  _width = size.width; // Update width
                  _height = size.height; // Update height
                });
              },
              child: Container(
                color: Colors.blue,
                padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
                child: Text(
                  'Measure my size!',
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
                ),
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Display the measured size
            Text('Width: $_width, Height: $_height'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation

// The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `MyApp` widget.
// `MyApp` is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home widget.
// The home widget is `MeasuredSizeExample`, which is a StatefulWidget.
// Inside `_MeasuredSizeExampleState`, we define two variables `_width` and `_height` to store the measured dimensions.
// The `build` method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget containing a Column.
// The `MeasuredSize` widget wraps a Container that displays a text message.
// The `onChange` callback of `MeasuredSize` is triggered after the widget is rendered, providing the size of the Container.
// We update the `_width` and `_height` variables using `setState`, which triggers a rebuild of the UI.
// Finally, we display the measured width and height below the Container, allowing users to see the results of the measurement.
