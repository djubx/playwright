Here's a detailed technical blog on the "cli_spin" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# CLI Spin Flutter Package

The `cli_spin` package is a Flutter library designed to provide a simple and effective way to create loading indicators in your applications. It allows developers to display a spinning loader while performing asynchronous tasks, enhancing the user experience by providing visual feedback during operations that may take time, such as network requests or data processing.

## When to Use `cli_spin`

You should consider using the `cli_spin` package in scenarios where:
- You need to indicate to users that a process is ongoing, such as fetching data from an API.
- You want to improve the perceived performance of your application by providing visual feedback.
- You are looking for a lightweight and customizable loading spinner that integrates seamlessly with your Flutter app.

## Features
- **Customizable Spinner**: You can easily customize the appearance of the spinner, including size, color, and animation speed.
- **Easy Integration**: The package is designed to be simple to integrate into existing Flutter applications.
- **Lightweight**: The package is lightweight, ensuring that it does not bloat your application size.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using CLI Spin

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `cli_spin` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  cli_spin: ^1.0.0
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

To use the `cli_spin` package in your Flutter application, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:cli_spin/cli_spin.dart';
```

2. Create a loading spinner using the `RealFlutter` class. You can customize the spinner's properties as needed.

3. Use the spinner in your widget tree, typically while waiting for an asynchronous operation to complete.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the spinner in a Flutter app:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cli_spin/cli_spin.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('CLI Spin Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: FutureBuilder(
            future: fetchData(), // Simulate a network call
            builder: (context, snapshot) {
              if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                // Show the spinner while waiting for data
                return CLISpin(
                  size: 50.0,
                  color: Colors.blue,
                );
              } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
                return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}');
              } else {
                return Text('Data: ${snapshot.data}');
              }
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  Future<String> fetchData() async {
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3)); // Simulate a delay
    return 'Fetched Data';
  }
}
```

In this example, the `CLISpin` widget is displayed while the app waits for the `fetchData` function to complete.

# Complete Example of CLI Spin in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cli_spin/cli_spin.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('CLI Spin Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: FutureBuilder(
            future: fetchData(), // Initiates the asynchronous operation
            builder: (context, snapshot) {
              if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                // While waiting for the data, show the loading spinner
                return CLISpin(
                  size: 50.0, // Set the size of the spinner
                  color: Colors.blue, // Set the color of the spinner
                );
              } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
                // If there is an error, display the error message
                return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}');
              } else {
                // Once data is fetched, display the data
                return Text('Data: ${snapshot.data}');
              }
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Simulates a network call that takes 3 seconds to complete
  Future<String> fetchData() async {
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3)); // Simulate a delay
    return 'Fetched Data'; // Return the fetched data
  }
}

// The main function to run the app
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The app starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` widget.
2. The `RealFlutter` widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
3. Inside the Center widget, a FutureBuilder is used to handle the asynchronous operation of fetching data.
4. The `fetchData` function simulates a network call with a 3-second delay.
5. While waiting for the data, the `CLISpin` widget is displayed, indicating that a loading process is ongoing.
6. Once the data is fetched, it is displayed in the Text widget. If an error occurs, the error message is shown instead.
