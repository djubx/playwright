// This is the main entry point of the application.
// The RealFlutter class is a stateful widget that contains the CustomPinKeyboard.
// The CustomPinKeyboard is customized with a pin length of 4 and a numeric keyboard type.
// When the user enters a PIN, the onChanged callback is triggered, updating the _pin state variable.
// The PIN is displayed on the screen using the Text widget.

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user launches the application and is presented with a screen containing the CustomPinKeyboard.
// 2. The user enters a PIN using the CustomPinKeyboard.
// 3. The onChanged callback is triggered, updating the _pin state variable.
// 4. The PIN is displayed on the screen using the Text widget.

// In summary, this code demonstrates the usage of the CustomPinKeyboard package in a Flutter application.
// It shows how to customize the keyboard layout and design, and how to handle user input using the onChanged callback.
