# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Custom Pin Keyboard

## Installation
To add the `custom_pin_keyboard` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  custom_pin_keyboard: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/custom_pin_keyboard).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No specific configurations are required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your app requires any specific capabilities.

## Using the Package
To use the `custom_pin_keyboard`, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:custom_pin_keyboard/custom_pin_keyboard.dart';
```

You can then create a simple widget that utilizes the custom pin keyboard. Below is a basic example of how to implement it in your Flutter application.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:custom_pin_keyboard/custom_pin_keyboard.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Custom Pin Keyboard Example',
      home: PinInputScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PinInputScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PinInputScreenState createState() => _PinInputScreenState();
}

class _PinInputScreenState extends State<PinInputScreen> {
  String pin = ''; // Variable to hold the entered PIN

  // Function to handle pin input
  void onPinChanged(String value) {
    setState(() {
      pin = value; // Update the pin variable with the new value
    });
  }

  // Function to handle pin submission
  void onSubmit() {
    // Here you can handle the submission of the pin
    print('Entered PIN: $pin'); // For demonstration, we print the PIN
    // You can add your authentication logic here
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Enter Your PIN'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: [
          // Display the entered PIN
          Text(
            'PIN: $pin',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20),
          // Custom Pin Keyboard
          CustomPinKeyboard(
            onChanged: onPinChanged, // Callback for pin changes
            onSubmit: onSubmit, // Callback for pin submission
            length: 4, // Set the length of the PIN
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (PinInputScreen).
// 3. PinInputScreen is a stateful widget that maintains the state of the entered PIN.
// 4. The onPinChanged function updates the pin variable whenever the user inputs a new digit.
// 5. The onSubmit function is called when the user submits the PIN, where you can handle authentication logic.
// 6. The UI displays the current PIN and the custom pin keyboard for user input.
