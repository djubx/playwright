<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# SMS OTP Auto Verify Flutter Package

The `sms_otp_auto_verify` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to implement SMS-based one-time password (OTP) verification in their applications. This package simplifies the process of receiving and verifying OTPs sent via SMS, making it easier to enhance user authentication and security.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `sms_otp_auto_verify` package in scenarios such as:
- **User Registration**: When new users sign up, you can send them an OTP to verify their phone number.
- **Password Recovery**: If users forget their passwords, you can send an OTP to their registered phone number for verification.
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Enhance security by requiring an OTP in addition to a password during login.

## Features

- **Automatic OTP Detection**: The package can automatically read the OTP from incoming SMS messages, reducing user input errors.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup and usage, allowing developers to focus on building their applications rather than dealing with complex authentication flows.

Overall, the `sms_otp_auto_verify` package is an excellent choice for developers looking to implement secure and user-friendly OTP verification in their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using SMS OTP Auto Verify

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `sms_otp_auto_verify` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `sms_otp_auto_verify` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  sms_otp_auto_verify: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Configure Android

For Android, you need to add the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_SMS"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_SMS"/>
```

Additionally, ensure that your app has the correct `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21  // Minimum SDK version should be 21 or higher
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Configure iOS

For iOS, you need to add the following permissions in your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to send OTP.</string>
<key>NSContactsUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your contacts to send OTP.</string>
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your location to send OTP.</string>
```

## Step 4: Implementing the Package

Now that we have configured the package, we can implement it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to use the `sms_otp_auto_verify` package to send and verify an OTP.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sms_otp_auto_verify/sms_otp_auto_verify.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'SMS OTP Auto Verify Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: OTPVerificationScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class OTPVerificationScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _OTPVerificationScreenState createState() => _OTPVerificationScreenState();
}

class _OTPVerificationScreenState extends State<OTPVerificationScreen> {
  String _phoneNumber = ''; // Variable to hold the phone number
  String _otpCode = ''; // Variable to hold the OTP code
  String _verificationId = ''; // Variable to hold the verification ID

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Start listening for incoming SMS messages
    SmsAutoVerify.startListening();
  }

  // Function to send OTP
  void _sendOTP() async {
    // Send OTP to the provided phone number
    _verificationId = await SmsAutoVerify.sendOTP(_phoneNumber);
    print('OTP sent to $_phoneNumber');
  }

  // Function to verify OTP
  void _verifyOTP() async {
    // Verify the OTP entered by the user
    bool isVerified = await SmsAutoVerify.verifyOTP(_verificationId, _otpCode);
    if (isVerified) {
      print('OTP verified successfully!');
      // Navigate to the next screen or show success message
    } else {
      print('OTP verification failed. Please try again.');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('OTP Verification'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Phone Number'),
              onChanged: (value) {
                _phoneNumber = value; // Update phone number
              },
            ),
            TextField(
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'OTP Code'),
              onChanged: (value) {
                _otpCode = value; // Update OTP code
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _sendOTP, // Send OTP when button is pressed
              child: Text('Send OTP'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _verifyOTP, // Verify OTP when button is pressed
              child: Text('Verify OTP'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Stop listening for incoming SMS messages
    SmsAutoVerify.stopListening();
    super.dispose();
  }
}
```

// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application for OTP verification using the sms_otp_auto_verify package. 
// Here's a step-by-step explanation of the application flow:

// 1. **Main Application**: The `main` function initializes the app and sets `MyApp` as the home widget.
// 2. **OTPVerificationScreen**: This is the main screen where users can enter their phone number and OTP code.
// 3. **State Management**: The `_OTPVerificationScreenState` class manages the state of the phone number and OTP code.
// 4. **initState**: When the widget is initialized, it starts listening for incoming SMS messages.
// 5. **Sending OTP**: The `_sendOTP` function sends an OTP to the provided phone number using the `SmsAutoVerify.sendOTP` method.
// 6. **Verifying OTP**: The `_verifyOTP` function verifies the entered OTP using the `SmsAutoVerify.verifyOTP` method and provides feedback based on the verification result.
// 7. **UI Elements**: The UI consists of text fields for entering the phone number and OTP, along with buttons to send and verify the OTP.
// 8. **dispose**: When the widget is disposed, it stops listening for incoming SMS messages to free up resources.

// This application flow provides a straightforward user experience for OTP verification, enhancing security in user authentication.
