# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Animated SVG Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `animated_svg` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  animated_svg: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/animated_svg).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable the use of SVG files in your project. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>fetch</string>
</array>
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:animated_svg/animated_svg.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the `AnimatedSvg` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
AnimatedSvg(
  asset: 'assets/your_svg_file.svg',
  duration: Duration(seconds: 2),
  repeat: true,
)
```

This widget will animate the SVG file located in your assets folder over a duration of 2 seconds and will repeat the animation indefinitely.

## Conclusion

With these steps, you should be able to set up and start using the `animated_svg` package in your Flutter applications. The package provides a straightforward way to add animated SVG graphics, enhancing the visual appeal and interactivity of your app.

# Complete Example of Using Animated SVG

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_svg/animated_svg.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animated SVG Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Animated SVG Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          // Centering the Animated SVG widget in the middle of the screen
          child: AnimatedSvg(
            asset: 'assets/your_svg_file.svg', // Path to your SVG file
            duration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Duration of the animation
            repeat: true, // Repeat the animation indefinitely
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Animated SVG Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers the AnimatedSvg widget.
// 5. The AnimatedSvg widget takes an SVG asset, sets the animation duration to 2 seconds, and enables repeating the animation.
// 6. When the app runs, the SVG will animate continuously, providing a dynamic visual experience.
```
