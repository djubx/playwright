# Expansion Widget Flutter Package

The `expansion_widget` Flutter package is a versatile and user-friendly widget that allows developers to create expandable and collapsible sections in their applications. This package is particularly useful for displaying content that can be hidden or shown based on user interaction, such as FAQs, settings, or any other content that benefits from a clean and organized layout.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the `expansion_widget` package in scenarios such as:
- **FAQs**: To allow users to expand questions to see answers without cluttering the interface.

## Features

- **Customizable Headers**: You can customize the appearance of the header, including text, icons, and styles.
- **Animation Support**: The package provides smooth animations for expanding and collapsing sections, enhancing user experience.
- **Flexible Content**: You can include any widget as content, allowing for a wide range of use cases.
- **State Management**: The package manages the state of expansion, making it easy to control which sections are open or closed.

Overall, the `expansion_widget` package is a powerful tool for enhancing the user interface of Flutter applications by providing a clean and interactive way to display content.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Expansion Widget

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `expansion_widget` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `expansion_widget` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  expansion_widget: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Expansion Widget

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using the `ExpansionWidget` in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement it.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:expansion_widget/expansion_widget.dart'; // Import the package

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Expansion Widget Example'),
        ),
        body: ListView(
          children: [
            ExpansionWidget(
              header: Text('Section 1'),
              content: Text('This is the content of section 1.'),
            ),
            ExpansionWidget(
              header: Text('Section 2'),
              content: Text('This is the content of section 2.'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with two expandable sections. Each section has a header and content that can be expanded or collapsed.

# Complete Example of the Expansion Widget

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:expansion_widget/expansion_widget.dart'; // Import the expansion widget package

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Expansion Widget Example'), // Title of the app
        ),
        body: ListView(
          children: [
            // First expandable section
            ExpansionWidget(
              header: Text('Section 1'), // Header of the section
              content: Column( // Content of the section
                children: [
                  Text('This is the content of section 1.'),
                  Text('More details can go here.'),
                ],
              ),
            ),
            // Second expandable section
            ExpansionWidget(
              header: Text('Section 2'), // Header of the section
              content: Column( // Content of the section
                children: [
                  Text('This is the content of section 2.'),
                  Text('Additional information can be added here.'),
                ],
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the app
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a ListView.
// 3. The ListView contains two ExpansionWidget instances, each with a header and content.
// 4. When a user taps on a section header, the corresponding content expands or collapses, providing an interactive experience.
// 5. The content can be customized with any widget, allowing for flexible layouts and information display.
```
