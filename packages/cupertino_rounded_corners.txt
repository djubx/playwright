# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Cupertino Rounded Corners

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `cupertino_rounded_corners` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cupertino_rounded_corners: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### For Android

No specific configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### For iOS

For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to apply rounded corners to a `Container` widget:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cupertino_rounded_corners/cupertino_rounded_corners.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Cupertino Rounded Corners Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: RoundedContainer(
            child: Padding(
              padding: const EdgeInsets.all(20.0),
              child: Text('Hello, Cupertino!'),
            ),
            radius: 20.0, // Set the corner radius
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a `RoundedContainer` with a corner radius of 20.0, which gives it a smooth, rounded appearance.

# Complete Example of Cupertino Rounded Corners

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cupertino_rounded_corners/cupertino_rounded_corners.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Cupertino Rounded Corners Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Center widget to align the RoundedContainer in the middle of the screen
          child: RoundedContainer(
            // Using the RoundedContainer widget from the package
            child: Padding(
              // Adding padding inside the container
              padding: const EdgeInsets.all(20.0),
              child: Text('Hello, Cupertino!'),
            ),
            radius: 20.0, // Setting the corner radius to 20.0
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the Flutter application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp, which is the root of the application.
// 3. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold widget is created, providing a structure for the app with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body contains a Center widget that centers its child, which is a RoundedContainer.
// 5. The RoundedContainer is a custom widget that applies rounded corners to its child.
// 6. Inside the RoundedContainer, we use Padding to add space around the Text widget, which displays "Hello, Cupertino!".
// 7. The radius property of the RoundedContainer is set to 20.0, giving it a smooth rounded appearance.
