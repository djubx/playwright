Here's a detailed technical blog on the "pyramid_lint" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Description

The `pyramid_lint` package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers to enforce coding standards and maintain code quality. It provides a set of linting rules that help identify potential issues in your codebase, ensuring that your Flutter applications are not only functional but also adhere to best practices.

## When to Use `pyramid_lint`

You should consider using `pyramid_lint` in the following scenarios:

- **Code Quality Assurance**: When working in a team, it's crucial to maintain a consistent code style. `pyramid_lint` helps enforce coding standards across the codebase.
- **Refactoring**: If you're refactoring an existing codebase, using `pyramid_lint` can help identify areas that need improvement or potential bugs.
- **New Projects**: Starting a new Flutter project? Integrating `pyramid_lint` from the beginning can save time and effort in the long run by preventing bad practices.

## Features

- **Customizable Linting Rules**: You can configure the linting rules according to your project's needs.
- **Integration with CI/CD**: Easily integrate `pyramid_lint` into your continuous integration pipeline to ensure code quality before deployment.
- **Detailed Reports**: The package provides detailed reports on linting issues, making it easier to address them.

By incorporating `pyramid_lint` into your Flutter development workflow, you can significantly enhance the maintainability and quality of your code.

# Tutorial

## Setup Process

To get started with `pyramid_lint`, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add `pyramid_lint` to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  pyramid_lint: ^1.0.0
```

### Step 2: Install the Package

Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Step 3: Configure Linting Rules

Create a `.pyramid_lint.yaml` file in the root of your Flutter project. This file will contain your custom linting rules. Hereâ€™s an example configuration:

```yaml
rules:
  - avoid_print: true
  - prefer_const_constructors: true
  - unnecessary_new: true
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file is configured to use the latest version of the Kotlin plugin, as `pyramid_lint` may rely on certain Kotlin features.

```gradle
buildscript {
    ext.kotlin_version = '1.5.31'
    dependencies {
        classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:$kotlin_version"
    }
}
```

#### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your `Podfile` is set to use the latest version of Flutter and CocoaPods. This ensures compatibility with the latest features of `pyramid_lint`.

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

### Step 4: Run Linting

To run the linting process, use the following command:

```bash
flutter pub run pyramid_lint
```

This command will analyze your codebase and provide a report of any linting issues found.

By following these steps, you can successfully integrate `pyramid_lint` into your Flutter project and start enforcing coding standards.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pyramid_lint/pyramid_lint.dart'; // Importing the pyramid_lint package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the RealFlutter app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Pyramid Lint Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(), // Setting the home page of the app
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Pyramid Lint Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // This button triggers the linting process
            runLinting();
          },
          child: Text('Run Linting'), // Button text
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void runLinting() {
    // This function runs the pyramid_lint analysis
    // It will check the code for any linting issues
    final result = PyramidLint.run(); // Running the linting process
    // Displaying the linting results
    print('Linting Results: $result');
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp has a title and a theme, and it sets MyHomePage as the home widget.
// 4. MyHomePage contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. The Center widget holds an ElevatedButton that, when pressed, calls the runLinting function.
// 6. The runLinting function executes the linting process using PyramidLint.run() and prints the results to the console.
