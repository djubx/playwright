Here's a detailed technical blog on the `proper_filesize` Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Description

The `proper_filesize` Flutter package is a utility designed to help developers easily format file sizes into human-readable strings. This package is particularly useful when displaying file sizes in applications, such as file managers, download managers, or any app that deals with file uploads and downloads. 

## Features
- **Human-Readable Format**: Converts file sizes into a more understandable format (e.g., converting bytes to KB, MB, GB).
- **Customizable Units**: Allows developers to specify the unit of measurement for the output.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that can be easily integrated into any Flutter application.

## When to Use
You should consider using the `proper_filesize` package when:
- You need to display file sizes in a user-friendly manner.
- You are developing applications that involve file uploads, downloads, or management.
- You want to ensure that file sizes are displayed consistently across different parts of your application.

## Example Use Cases
1. **File Uploads**: Displaying the size of files being uploaded to inform users about the data they are transferring.
2. **Download Managers**: Showing the size of files being downloaded to give users an idea of how much space will be used.
3. **File Managers**: Listing file sizes in a file explorer application to help users manage their storage effectively.

# Tutorial

## Setup Process
To use the `proper_filesize` package in your Flutter application, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `proper_filesize` package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     proper_filesize: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
   ```

2. **Install the Package**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: No additional configuration is required for Android.
   - **iOS**: Ensure that your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

     ```ruby
     platform :ios, '10.0'
     ```

## Using the Package
To use the `proper_filesize` package, import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:proper_filesize/proper_filesize.dart';
```

### Basic Usage Example
Hereâ€™s how to convert a file size in bytes to a human-readable format:

```dart
void main() {
  int fileSizeInBytes = 123456789; // Example file size
  String readableSize = properFileSize(fileSizeInBytes);
  print(readableSize); // Output: "117.74 MB"
}
```

### Customizing Units
You can also specify the unit of measurement:

```dart
String readableSizeInKB = properFileSize(fileSizeInBytes, unit: FileSizeUnit.kilobyte);
print(readableSizeInKB); // Output: "120563.67 KB"
```

This flexibility allows you to tailor the output to your application's needs.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:proper_filesize/proper_filesize.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Proper File Size Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('File Size Formatter'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: FileSizeDisplay(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class FileSizeDisplay extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Example file sizes in bytes
    int fileSize1 = 1024; // 1 KB
    int fileSize2 = 1048576; // 1 MB
    int fileSize3 = 1073741824; // 1 GB

    // Convert file sizes to human-readable format
    String readableSize1 = properFileSize(fileSize1);
    String readableSize2 = properFileSize(fileSize2);
    String readableSize3 = properFileSize(fileSize3);

    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Text('File Size 1: $readableSize1'), // Output: "1.00 KB"
        Text('File Size 2: $readableSize2'), // Output: "1.00 MB"
        Text('File Size 3: $readableSize3'), // Output: "1.00 GB"
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a centered body that displays the FileSizeDisplay widget.
// 4. The FileSizeDisplay widget converts three example file sizes (1 KB, 1 MB, and 1 GB) into human-readable formats using the properFileSize function.
// 5. Finally, it displays the formatted file sizes in a column of text widgets.
```
