## Setup Process

To get started with the `amplify_analytics_pinpoint` package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add Dependencies

Add the following dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  amplify_flutter: ^0.2.0
  amplify_analytics_pinpoint: ^0.2.0
```

### Step 2: Configure Amplify

Before using the package, you need to configure Amplify in your Flutter application. This involves setting up AWS Amplify in the AWS Management Console and creating a new project.

1. **Create an AWS Account**: If you don't have one, create an AWS account.
2. **Set Up Amplify**: Use the Amplify CLI to initialize a new project:
   ```bash
   amplify init
   ```
3. **Add Analytics**: Add the analytics category to your project:
   ```bash
   amplify add analytics
   ```
   Choose AWS Pinpoint as the analytics provider.

4. **Deploy Changes**: Deploy your changes to AWS:
   ```bash
   amplify push
   ```

### Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21 // or higher
       }
   }
   ```

2. Ensure you have the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

#### iOS

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. Ensure you have the correct deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

### Step 4: Initialize Amplify in Your App

In your main Dart file, initialize Amplify and configure the analytics plugin:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:amplify_flutter/amplify.dart';
import 'package:amplify_analytics_pinpoint/amplify_analytics_pinpoint.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Amplify Analytics Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _configureAmplify();
  }

  Future<void> _configureAmplify() async {
    final analyticsPlugin = AmplifyAnalyticsPinpoint();
    await Amplify.addPlugin(analyticsPlugin);
    await Amplify.configure(amplifyconfig); // Load your amplifyconfiguration
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Amplify Analytics')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Welcome to Amplify Analytics!')),
    );
  }
}
```

This code initializes the Amplify framework and sets up the analytics plugin, allowing you to start tracking user events.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:amplify_flutter/amplify.dart';
import 'package:amplify_analytics_pinpoint/amplify_analytics_pinpoint.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Amplify Analytics Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _configureAmplify(); // Call the method to configure Amplify
  }

  // Method to configure Amplify and add the analytics plugin
  Future<void> _configureAmplify() async {
    final analyticsPlugin = AmplifyAnalyticsPinpoint(); // Create an instance of the analytics plugin
    await Amplify.addPlugin(analyticsPlugin); // Add the plugin to Amplify
    await Amplify.configure(amplifyconfig); // Load your amplifyconfiguration
  }

  // Method to log an event when a button is pressed
  void _logEvent() async {
    try {
      // Create a custom event
      var event = AnalyticsEvent('button_click');
      event.properties.addAll({'button_name': 'example_button'}); // Add properties to the event
      await Amplify.Analytics.recordEvent(event); // Record the event
      print('Event recorded: ${event.name}'); // Log the event name
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error recording event: $e'); // Handle any errors
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Amplify Analytics')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            _logEvent(); // Log the event when the button is pressed
          },
          child: Text('Log Event'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation

// The application starts by running the `MyApp` widget.
// In the `MyApp` widget, the `HomeScreen` is set as the home screen.
// When the `HomeScreen` is initialized, it calls the `_configureAmplify` method.
// This method creates an instance of `AmplifyAnalyticsPinpoint` and adds it to Amplify.
// It then configures Amplify with the provided configuration.
// The UI consists of a button that, when pressed, triggers the `_logEvent` method.
// This method creates a custom analytics event named 'button_click' and adds a property to it.
// The event is then recorded using `Amplify.Analytics.recordEvent`.
// If successful, a message is printed to the console indicating the event was recorded.
// If there is an error, it is caught and printed to the console.
