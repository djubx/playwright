# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Giphy_Get Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the `giphy_get` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  giphy_get: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Configure API Key
To use the Giphy API, you need an API key. Follow these steps to obtain one:
1. Go to the [Giphy Developers](https://developers.giphy.com/) website.
2. Sign up or log in to your account.
3. Create a new app to get your API key.

Once you have your API key, you can use it in your application.

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following permissions to allow internet access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement GIF searching functionality.

# Complete Example: Implementing Giphy_Get in a Flutter App

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:giphy_get/giphy_get.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Giphy Get Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: GiphyHome(),
    );
  }
}

class GiphyHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _GiphyHomeState createState() => _GiphyHomeState();
}

class _GiphyHomeState extends State<GiphyHome> {
  String? _gifUrl; // Variable to store the selected GIF URL

  // Function to open the Giphy GIF picker
  Future<void> _pickGif() async {
    final result = await GiphyGet.getGif(
      context: context,
      apiKey: 'YOUR_GIPHY_API_KEY', // Replace with your Giphy API key
      // Optional parameters
      // You can customize the search or limit the results
    );

    // Check if a GIF was selected
    if (result != null) {
      setState(() {
        _gifUrl = result.images?.fixedHeight?.url; // Store the selected GIF URL
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Giphy Get Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the selected GIF if available
            if (_gifUrl != null)
              Image.network(_gifUrl!)
            else
              Text('No GIF selected.'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _pickGif, // Call the function to pick a GIF
              child: Text('Pick a GIF'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The GiphyHome widget is the main screen where users can pick a GIF.
// 4. When the "Pick a GIF" button is pressed, the _pickGif function is called.
// 5. The GiphyGet.getGif method opens the Giphy GIF picker.
// 6. If a GIF is selected, its URL is stored in the _gifUrl variable.
// 7. The selected GIF is displayed in the center of the screen.
// 8. If no GIF is selected, a message is shown instead.
```
