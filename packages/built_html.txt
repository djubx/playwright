# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Built_HTML

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **built_html** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  built_html: ^0.1.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configurations

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you are loading external content. Add the following lines to allow arbitrary loads:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to render HTML content.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:built_html/built_html.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample HTML content
    String htmlContent = """
      <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
      <p>This is a <strong>sample</strong> HTML content.</p>
      <a href='https://flutter.dev'>Visit Flutter</a>
    """;

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Built HTML Example')),
        body: SingleChildScrollView(
          child: BuiltHtml(
            data: htmlContent,
            // You can customize the rendering of specific tags here
            onLinkTap: (url) {
              // Handle link taps
              print('Opening $url');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Built_HTML in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:built_html/built_html.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample HTML content to be rendered
    String htmlContent = """
      <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
      <p>This is a <strong>sample</strong> HTML content.</p>
      <a href='https://flutter.dev'>Visit Flutter</a>
    """;

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Built HTML Example')),
        body: SingleChildScrollView(
          child: BuiltHtml(
            data: htmlContent, // The HTML content to render
            onLinkTap: (url) {
              // Handle link taps
              print('Opening $url'); // Print the URL to console
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a body.
// 3. The body uses a SingleChildScrollView to allow scrolling of the content.
// 4. The BuiltHtml widget is used to render the HTML content defined in the htmlContent string.
// 5. When a link is tapped, the onLinkTap callback is triggered, printing the URL to the console.
```
