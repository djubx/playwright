# Overview of the `windows_system_info` Flutter Package

The `windows_system_info` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to provide detailed system information for Windows devices. This package is particularly useful for developers who need to access system-level details such as CPU usage, memory statistics, and other hardware-related information directly from their Flutter applications.

## When to Use

This package is ideal for applications that require:
- Monitoring system performance metrics.
- Displaying hardware specifications to users.
- Collecting diagnostic information for troubleshooting purposes.

## Features

- **CPU Information**: Retrieve details about the CPU, including usage percentage and core count.
- **Memory Statistics**: Access information about total and available memory.
- **Disk Usage**: Get insights into disk space usage and availability.
- **Network Details**: Fetch network-related information such as IP addresses and connection status.

The `windows_system_info` package is a must-have for developers looking to integrate system-level insights into their Flutter applications on Windows platforms.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `windows_system_info`

In this section, we'll walk through the process of setting up and using the `windows_system_info` package in a Flutter project. We'll cover platform-specific details and any necessary configurations.

## Setup Process

1. **Add Dependency**: First, add the `windows_system_info` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     windows_system_info: ^1.0.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run `flutter pub get` to install the new package.

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**: 
   - **Windows**: Ensure that your Flutter project is configured to target Windows. This package is specifically designed for Windows, so no additional configuration is needed for other platforms.

## Using the Package

1. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the `windows_system_info` package.

   ```dart
   import 'package:windows_system_info/windows_system_info.dart';
   ```

2. **Access System Information**: Use the `RealFlutter` class to access various system metrics.

   ```dart
   void getSystemInfo() {
     var cpuInfo = RealFlutter.getCpuInfo();
     var memoryInfo = RealFlutter.getMemoryInfo();
     print('CPU Info: $cpuInfo');
     print('Memory Info: $memoryInfo');
   }
   ```

This setup allows you to easily integrate system information retrieval into your Flutter application, providing valuable insights into the device's performance and capabilities.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:windows_system_info/windows_system_info.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Windows System Info Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: SystemInfoScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class SystemInfoScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SystemInfoScreenState createState() => _SystemInfoScreenState();
}

class _SystemInfoScreenState extends State<SystemInfoScreen> {
  String cpuInfo = 'Loading...';
  String memoryInfo = 'Loading...';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    fetchSystemInfo();
  }

  // Fetches system information using the RealFlutter class
  void fetchSystemInfo() async {
    // Retrieve CPU information
    var cpu = await RealFlutter.getCpuInfo();
    // Retrieve Memory information
    var memory = await RealFlutter.getMemoryInfo();

    // Update the state with the retrieved information
    setState(() {
      cpuInfo = cpu.toString();
      memoryInfo = memory.toString();
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('System Information'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('CPU Information:', style: TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold)),
            Text(cpuInfo),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text('Memory Information:', style: TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold)),
            Text(memoryInfo),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow:
// 1. The application starts by running the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a home screen of SystemInfoScreen.
// 3. SystemInfoScreen is a stateful widget that initializes by calling fetchSystemInfo.
// 4. fetchSystemInfo uses the RealFlutter class to asynchronously retrieve CPU and memory information.
// 5. Once the information is retrieved, the state is updated, triggering a rebuild of the UI.
// 6. The UI displays the CPU and memory information in a simple column layout.
