# Setting Up and Using Flutter Paystack Plus

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_paystack_plus` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_paystack_plus` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_paystack_plus: ^2.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Configure Android

For Android, you need to add the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

Also, ensure that you have the correct `minSdkVersion` in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // or higher
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Configure iOS

For iOS, you need to add the following to your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Initialize Paystack

In your Flutter application, you need to initialize Paystack with your public key. You can obtain this key from your Paystack dashboard.

```dart
import 'package:flutter_paystack_plus/flutter_paystack_plus.dart';

void main() {
  PaystackPlugin.initialize(publicKey: 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY');
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 5: Implement Payment

To implement payment, you can create a function that handles the payment process. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
void chargeCard() async {
  // Create a charge object
  Charge charge = Charge()
    ..amount = 10000 // Amount in kobo
    ..email = 'customer@example.com'
    ..card = card; // Card object

  // Start the payment process
  CheckoutResponse response = await PaystackPlugin.checkout(context,
      charge: charge,
      method: CheckoutMethod.card,
      fullscreen: true);

  if (response.status) {
    // Payment was successful
    print('Payment successful: ${response.reference}');
  } else {
    // Payment failed
    print('Payment failed: ${response.message}');
  }
}
```

With these steps, you can successfully integrate and use the `flutter_paystack_plus` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Flutter Paystack Plus

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_paystack_plus/flutter_paystack_plus.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize Paystack with your public key
  PaystackPlugin.initialize(publicKey: 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY');
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Paystack Plus Example',
      home: PaymentScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PaymentScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PaymentScreenState createState() => _PaymentScreenState();
}

class _PaymentScreenState extends State<PaymentScreen> {
  // Create a card object
  final card = Card(
    number: '4084084084084081', // Test card number
    cvv: '123',
    expiryMonth: 12,
    expiryYear: 25,
  );

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Paystack Payment'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: chargeCard, // Call chargeCard on button press
          child: Text('Pay Now'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void chargeCard() async {
    // Create a charge object
    Charge charge = Charge()
      ..amount = 10000 // Amount in kobo
      ..email = 'customer@example.com'
      ..card = card; // Card object

    // Start the payment process
    CheckoutResponse response = await PaystackPlugin.checkout(context,
        charge: charge,
        method: CheckoutMethod.card,
        fullscreen: true);

    if (response.status) {
      // Payment was successful
      print('Payment successful: ${response.reference}');
    } else {
      // Payment failed
      print('Payment failed: ${response.message}');
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts by initializing Paystack with the public key.
// 2. The main widget is a MaterialApp that contains a PaymentScreen.
// 3. The PaymentScreen has a button that triggers the chargeCard function when pressed.
// 4. The chargeCard function creates a Charge object with the payment details.
// 5. It then calls the Paystack checkout method to process the payment.
// 6. If the payment is successful, it prints the payment reference; otherwise, it prints an error message.
```
