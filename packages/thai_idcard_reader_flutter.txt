# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Thai ID Card Reader Flutter Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `thai_idcard_reader_flutter` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `thai_idcard_reader_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  thai_idcard_reader_flutter: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open `AndroidManifest.xml` located in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
   ```

2. **Minimum SDK Version**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open `Info.plist` located in `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request camera access:

   ```xml
   <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to the camera to scan your ID card.</string>
   <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your photo library to save scanned images.</string>
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to implement the ID card reader functionality.

<!-- END_TUTORIAL -->

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:thai_idcard_reader_flutter/thai_idcard_reader_flutter.dart'; // Import the package

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Thai ID Card Reader',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: IDCardReaderScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class IDCardReaderScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _IDCardReaderScreenState createState() => _IDCardReaderScreenState();
}

class _IDCardReaderScreenState extends State<IDCardReaderScreen> {
  String _idCardData = ''; // Variable to hold the scanned ID card data

  // Function to initiate the ID card scanning process
  Future<void> _scanIDCard() async {
    try {
      // Call the scan method from the package
      final result = await ThaiIdCardReader.scan();
      // Update the state with the scanned data
      setState(() {
        _idCardData = result; // Store the scanned data
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during scanning
      setState(() {
        _idCardData = 'Error: $e'; // Display error message
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Thai ID Card Reader'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _scanIDCard, // Trigger the scan when button is pressed
              child: Text('Scan Thai ID Card'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(
              'Scanned Data: $_idCardData', // Display the scanned data
              textAlign: TextAlign.center,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The home screen is set to IDCardReaderScreen, where the main functionality resides.
// 3. The IDCardReaderScreen contains a button to initiate the scanning process.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the _scanIDCard function is called.
// 5. This function uses the ThaiIdCardReader.scan() method to scan the ID card.
// 6. If successful, the scanned data is displayed on the screen; if an error occurs, it is caught and displayed.
```
