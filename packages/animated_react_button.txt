    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Animated React Button Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: AnimatedReactButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Action to perform on button press
            print('Button Pressed!');
          },
          child: Text('Press Me'),
        ),

# Complete Example of animated_react_button

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_react_button/animated_react_button.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animated React Button Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Animated React Button Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: AnimatedReactButton(
          // The onPressed callback is triggered when the button is pressed
          onPressed: () {
            // Action to perform on button press
            print('Button Pressed!');
          },
          // The child widget of the button
          child: Text('Press Me'),
          // Optional: Customize the button's appearance
          buttonColor: Colors.blue,
          textColor: Colors.white,
          // Optional: Add animations for different states
          animationDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 300),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to RealFlutter, which is the main screen.
// 4. RealFlutter builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, an AnimatedReactButton is created.
// 6. The button has an onPressed callback that prints a message to the console when pressed.
// 7. The button's appearance can be customized with properties like buttonColor and textColor.
// 8. The animation duration can also be set to control how quickly the button responds to user interactions.
