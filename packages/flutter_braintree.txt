# Setting Up `flutter_braintree` in Your Flutter Project

In this section, we'll walk through the setup process for integrating the `flutter_braintree` package into a Flutter application. We'll cover platform-specific configurations for both Android and iOS.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

First, add the `flutter_braintree` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_braintree: ^1.2.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Android Configuration

1. **Add Permissions**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

2. **Configure Gradle**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

   ```gradle
   android {
       defaultConfig {
           minSdkVersion 21
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Add Braintree SDK**: In the same `build.gradle` file, add the Braintree SDK dependency:

   ```gradle
   dependencies {
       implementation 'com.braintreepayments.api:drop-in:5.2.0'
   }
   ```

## Step 3: iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following entries:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. **Podfile Configuration**: Ensure your `ios/Podfile` has platform set to 10.0 or higher:

   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

3. **Install Pods**: Run `pod install` in the `ios` directory to install necessary dependencies.

## Step 4: Initialize Braintree

In your Dart code, initialize the Braintree client with your tokenization key or client token.

```dart
import 'package:flutter_braintree/flutter_braintree.dart';

final request = BraintreeDropInRequest(
  tokenizationKey: 'your_tokenization_key',
  collectDeviceData: true,
  paypalRequest: BraintreePayPalRequest(
    amount: '10.00',
    displayName: 'Your Company',
  ),
  cardEnabled: true,
);
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_braintree/flutter_braintree.dart';

void main() => runApp(RealFlutter());

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Braintree Payment Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: PaymentPage(),
    );
  }
}

class PaymentPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PaymentPageState createState() => _PaymentPageState();
}

class _PaymentPageState extends State<PaymentPage> {
  // This method is triggered when the user presses the payment button
  Future<void> _startPayment() async {
    // Create a BraintreeDropInRequest with necessary configurations
    final request = BraintreeDropInRequest(
      tokenizationKey: 'your_tokenization_key', // Replace with your tokenization key
      collectDeviceData: true,
      paypalRequest: BraintreePayPalRequest(
        amount: '10.00', // Amount to be charged
        displayName: 'Your Company', // Display name for PayPal
      ),
      cardEnabled: true, // Enable card payments
    );

    // Show the Braintree Drop-in UI and await the result
    final result = await BraintreeDropIn.start(request);

    // Check if the result is not null, indicating a successful payment
    if (result != null) {
      // Display the payment method nonce
      print('Payment method nonce: ${result.paymentMethodNonce.nonce}');
      // Show a success message to the user
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Payment successful!')),
      );
    } else {
      // Show a cancellation message if the user cancels the payment
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Payment cancelled.')),
      );
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Braintree Payment'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _startPayment, // Trigger payment process on button press
          child: Text('Pay Now'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow:
// 1. The application starts with the `RealFlutter` widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The `PaymentPage` widget is the home screen, displaying a button to initiate payment.
// 3. When the button is pressed, `_startPayment` is called, which configures and starts the Braintree Drop-in UI.
// 4. The user can choose a payment method and complete the transaction.
// 5. If successful, the payment nonce is printed and a success message is shown.
// 6. If the user cancels, a cancellation message is displayed.
