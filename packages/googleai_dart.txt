# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using GoogleAI_Dart

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `googleai_dart` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `googleai_dart` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  googleai_dart: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21  // Minimum SDK version required
    }
}
```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. Ensure your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in our Flutter application. 

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:googleai_dart/googleai_dart.dart';
```

2. Initialize the Google AI service in your main application file and use its features as needed.

# Complete Example of GoogleAI_Dart in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:googleai_dart/googleai_dart.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Google AI Dart Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: AIHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class AIHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _AIHomePageState createState() => _AIHomePageState();
}

class _AIHomePageState extends State<AIHomePage> {
  String _result = '';

  // Function to analyze text using Google AI
  void _analyzeText(String text) async {
    // Create an instance of the Google AI service
    final googleAI = GoogleAI();

    // Call the text analysis method
    var analysisResult = await googleAI.analyzeText(text);

    // Update the result state
    setState(() {
      _result = analysisResult;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Google AI Dart Example'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              onSubmitted: _analyzeText, // Analyze text on submission
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Enter text to analyze',
                border: OutlineInputBorder(),
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text('Analysis Result: $_result'), // Display analysis result
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home page is set to AIHomePage, which is a stateful widget.
// 4. In AIHomePage, a text field is provided for user input.
// 5. When the user submits text, the _analyzeText function is called.
// 6. This function creates an instance of GoogleAI and calls the analyzeText method.
// 7. The result of the analysis is stored in the _result state variable.
// 8. The UI updates to display the analysis result below the text field.
```
