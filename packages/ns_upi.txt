# Setting Up and Using the ns_upi Package

## Installation

To use the `ns_upi` package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  ns_upi: ^latest_version
```

Replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/ns_upi).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

1. **Permissions**: Ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file. Add the following lines inside the `<manifest>` tag:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

2. **Minimum SDK Version**: Make sure your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS

1. **Permissions**: For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `Info.plist` file to allow network requests:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. **Deployment Target**: Ensure your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

## Using the Package

To initiate a UPI payment, you can use the following code snippet:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ns_upi/ns_upi.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('UPI Payment Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Create a UPI payment request
              UpiResponse response = await UpiPay.initiateUpiPayment(
                upiId: 'example@upi', // UPI ID of the recipient
                amount: '10.00', // Amount to be paid
                transactionRefId: 'txn123456', // Unique transaction reference ID
                transactionNote: 'Payment for services', // Note for the transaction
              );

              // Handle the response
              if (response.status == UpiPaymentStatus.success) {
                // Payment was successful
                print('Payment Successful: ${response.transactionId}');
              } else {
                // Payment failed or was cancelled
                print('Payment Failed: ${response.message}');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Pay with UPI'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Using ns_upi

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ns_upi/ns_upi.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('UPI Payment Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Create a UPI payment request
              UpiResponse response = await UpiPay.initiateUpiPayment(
                upiId: 'example@upi', // UPI ID of the recipient
                amount: '10.00', // Amount to be paid
                transactionRefId: 'txn123456', // Unique transaction reference ID
                transactionNote: 'Payment for services', // Note for the transaction
              );

              // Handle the response
              if (response.status == UpiPaymentStatus.success) {
                // Payment was successful
                print('Payment Successful: ${response.transactionId}');
              } else {
                // Payment failed or was cancelled
                print('Payment Failed: ${response.message}');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Pay with UPI'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with a MaterialApp widget that contains a Scaffold.
// 2. An AppBar is created with the title 'UPI Payment Example'.
// 3. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 4. An ElevatedButton is displayed with the text 'Pay with UPI'.
// 5. When the button is pressed, it triggers the onPressed callback.
// 6. Inside the callback, a UPI payment request is initiated using the UpiPay class.
// 7. The UPI ID, amount, transaction reference ID, and transaction note are provided.
// 8. The response from the payment request is awaited and stored in the response variable.
// 9. If the payment is successful, a success message is printed to the console.
// 10. If the payment fails or is cancelled, an error message is printed to the console.
