# Fast Immutable Collections in Flutter

The `fast_immutable_collections` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to leverage immutable data structures. Immutable collections are particularly useful in Flutter applications where state management is crucial, as they help prevent unintended side effects and make it easier to reason about the state of your application.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using `fast_immutable_collections` when:
- You need to manage complex state in your Flutter application.
- You want to ensure that your collections (like lists and maps) are immutable, which can help prevent bugs related to state changes.
- You are working with large datasets and require efficient operations on collections.

## Features

- **Immutable Collections**: Provides immutable versions of common collections such as `List`, `Set`, and `Map`.
- **Performance**: Optimized for performance, allowing for efficient operations on collections.
- **Functional Programming Style**: Encourages a functional programming approach, making it easier to work with data transformations.

Overall, `fast_immutable_collections` is an excellent choice for developers looking to implement immutable data structures in their Flutter applications, enhancing both performance and maintainability.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using fast_immutable_collections

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with `fast_immutable_collections`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  fast_immutable_collections: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure your `ios/Podfile` is set to use at least iOS 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the package as follows:

```dart
import 'package:fast_immutable_collections/fast_immutable_collections.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using Immutable Collections

You can now create and manipulate immutable collections. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
void main() {
  // Creating an immutable list
  final immutableList = IList<int>([1, 2, 3]);

  // Adding an element returns a new list
  final newList = immutableList.add(4);

  print(immutableList); // Output: IList([1, 2, 3])
  print(newList);       // Output: IList([1, 2, 3, 4])
}
```

This example demonstrates how to create an immutable list and add an element to it, resulting in a new list without modifying the original.

# Complete Example of fast_immutable_collections

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fast_immutable_collections/fast_immutable_collections.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Fast Immutable Collections Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Immutable Collections Example'),
        ),
        body: ImmutableListExample(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class ImmutableListExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ImmutableListExampleState createState() => _ImmutableListExampleState();
}

class _ImmutableListExampleState extends State<ImmutableListExample> {
  // Initial immutable list
  IList<String> items = IList(['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3']);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        Expanded(
          child: ListView.builder(
            itemCount: items.length,
            itemBuilder: (context, index) {
              return ListTile(
                title: Text(items[index]),
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _addItem,
          child: Text('Add Item'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }

  void _addItem() {
    // Adding a new item to the immutable list
    setState(() {
      items = items.add('Item ${items.length + 1}');
    });
  }
}

// The application starts with a list of three items.
// When the user presses the "Add Item" button, a new item is added to the list.
// The original list remains unchanged, demonstrating the immutability feature.
// The ListView displays the current items, and the state is updated using setState.
```

### Summary of Application Flow

- The application starts with a `RealFlutter` widget that sets up the main structure of the app.
- Inside the `RealFlutter` widget, a `MaterialApp` is created with a title and a home screen.
- The `ImmutableListExample` widget is responsible for displaying the list of items.
- An initial immutable list is created with three items.
- A `ListView` displays the items, and an `ElevatedButton` allows the user to add new items.
- When the button is pressed, the `_addItem` method is called, which creates a new list with the added item and updates the state using `setState()`.
- The original list remains unchanged, showcasing the immutability of the collections provided by the `fast_immutable_collections` package.
