<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# System Clock Flutter Package

The `system_clock` Flutter package provides a simple and efficient way to access the system clock in Flutter applications. It allows developers to retrieve the current time and date, making it useful for applications that require time-based functionalities, such as scheduling, timers, or displaying the current time.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the `system_clock` package in scenarios such as:
- **Real-time applications**: Apps that need to display the current time or date, like clocks or calendars.
- **Scheduling applications**: Apps that require scheduling features, such as reminders or event planners.
- **Games**: For tracking time elapsed during gameplay or for countdowns.

## Features
- **Current Time Retrieval**: Easily fetch the current system time.
- **Time Zone Support**: Handle different time zones effectively.
- **Date Formatting**: Format dates and times according to user preferences.

Overall, the `system_clock` package simplifies the process of working with time in Flutter applications, making it a valuable tool for developers.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the System Clock Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `system_clock` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  system_clock: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to access the system clock. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you typically do not need to add any special permissions for accessing the system clock. However, ensure that your app's deployment target is set to a version that supports the package.

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the `system_clock` package:

```dart
import 'package:system_clock/system_clock.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package

You can now use the `SystemClock` class to retrieve the current time. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
void main() {
  final currentTime = SystemClock.now();
  print('Current Time: $currentTime');
}
```

This will print the current system time to the console.

With these steps, you are now ready to use the `system_clock` package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Using the System Clock Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:system_clock/system_clock.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'System Clock Example',
      home: ClockScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ClockScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ClockScreenState createState() => _ClockScreenState();
}

class _ClockScreenState extends State<ClockScreen> {
  // Variable to hold the current time
  String _currentTime = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Update the current time when the widget is initialized
    _updateTime();
    // Set a timer to update the time every second
    Timer.periodic(Duration(seconds: 1), (timer) {
      _updateTime();
    });
  }

  // Function to update the current time
  void _updateTime() {
    // Get the current time from the system clock
    final now = SystemClock.now();
    // Format the time as a string
    setState(() {
      _currentTime = now.toString();
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Current Time'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          _currentTime, // Display the current time
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 48),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (ClockScreen).
// 3. ClockScreen is a stateful widget that manages the current time.
// 4. In the initState method, the _updateTime function is called to set the initial time.
// 5. A periodic timer is set to update the time every second.
// 6. The _updateTime function retrieves the current time using SystemClock.now() and updates the state.
// 7. The build method displays the current time in the center of the screen, updating every second.
```
