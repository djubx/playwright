# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Flip Card Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, you need to add the **flip_card** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flip_card: ^0.4.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install the Package
Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Import the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flip_card/flip_card.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Flip Card Widget
You can now use the `FlipCard` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
FlipCard(
  direction: FlipDirection.HORIZONTAL, // default
  front: Container(
    color: Colors.blue,
    child: Center(
      child: Text(
        'Front Side',
        style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24),
      ),
    ),
  ),
  back: Container(
    color: Colors.red,
    child: Center(
      child: Text(
        'Back Side',
        style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24),
      ),
    ),
  ),
);
```

This code creates a simple flip card with a blue front and a red back. You can customize the content and appearance as needed.

# Complete Example of Flip Card in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flip_card/flip_card.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flip Card Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flip Card Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: FlipCardWidget(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class FlipCardWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return FlipCard(
      direction: FlipDirection.HORIZONTAL, // Set the flip direction
      front: Container(
        width: 200,
        height: 300,
        color: Colors.blue, // Front side color
        child: Center(
          child: Text(
            'Front Side', // Front side text
            style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24),
          ),
        ),
      ),
      back: Container(
        width: 200,
        height: 300,
        color: Colors.red, // Back side color
        child: Center(
          child: Text(
            'Back Side', // Back side text
            style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. The Center widget holds the FlipCardWidget, which is where the flip card is created.
// 5. The FlipCard widget is configured to flip horizontally, with a blue front and a red back.
// 6. When the user taps the card, it flips to reveal the other side, demonstrating the interactive feature of the package.
