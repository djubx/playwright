# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `animated_pin_input_text_field`

## Installation
To use the `animated_pin_input_text_field` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package
To use the `animated_pin_input_text_field`, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:animated_pin_input_text_field/animated_pin_input_text_field.dart';
```

You can then create a simple PIN input widget as follows:

```dart
AnimatedPinInputTextField(
  length: 4, // Number of digits in the PIN
  onChanged: (value) {
    // Handle the change in input
    print("Current PIN: $value");
  },
  decoration: InputDecoration(
    border: OutlineInputBorder(),
    hintText: 'Enter PIN',
  ),
);
```

This will create a basic animated PIN input field. You can customize it further by adjusting the properties as needed.

# Complete Example of Using `animated_pin_input_text_field`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_pin_input_text_field/animated_pin_input_text_field.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animated PIN Input Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('PIN Input Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
            child: PinInputWidget(),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class PinInputWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PinInputWidgetState createState() => _PinInputWidgetState();
}

class _PinInputWidgetState extends State<PinInputWidget> {
  String pin = ''; // Variable to hold the entered PIN

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        AnimatedPinInputTextField(
          length: 4, // Set the length of the PIN
          onChanged: (value) {
            setState(() {
              pin = value; // Update the PIN variable on change
            });
          },
          decoration: InputDecoration(
            border: OutlineInputBorder(),
            hintText: 'Enter PIN',
          ),
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20),
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Handle the submission of the PIN
            print("Submitted PIN: $pin");
            // You can add further logic here, such as validation or API calls
          },
          child: Text('Submit'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, a Center widget is used to center the content.
// 4. The PinInputWidget is created, which contains the animated PIN input field.
// 5. The AnimatedPinInputTextField widget takes a length parameter and an onChanged callback.
// 6. When the user types in the PIN, the onChanged callback updates the pin variable.
// 7. An ElevatedButton is provided to submit the PIN, which prints the entered PIN to the console.
// 8. This structure allows for easy customization and further functionality, such as validation or API integration.
