## Setup Process

To get started with the `mercadopago_sdk`, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the `mercadopago_sdk` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  mercadopago_sdk: ^latest_version
```

Replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

### Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // or higher
        ...
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

#### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. Ensure your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

### Step 3: Initialize the SDK

In your main application file, initialize the SDK with your Mercado Pago credentials:

```dart
import 'package:mercadopago_sdk/mercadopago_sdk.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  MercadoPagoSdk.init('YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY', 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN');
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

Replace `YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY` and `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` with your actual Mercado Pago credentials.

### Step 4: Implement Payment Flow

You can now implement the payment flow in your application. The SDK provides methods to create payment preferences, handle payment processing, and manage responses.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mercadopago_sdk/mercadopago_sdk.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  // Initialize the Mercado Pago SDK with your credentials
  MercadoPagoSdk.init('YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY', 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN');
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Mercado Pago Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: PaymentScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PaymentScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PaymentScreenState createState() => _PaymentScreenState();
}

class _PaymentScreenState extends State<PaymentScreen> {
  // Method to handle payment
  void _processPayment() async {
    // Create a payment preference
    var preference = {
      "items": [
        {
          "title": "Test Product",
          "quantity": 1,
          "currency_id": "BRL",
          "unit_price": 100.0
        }
      ]
    };

    // Create a payment
    var payment = await MercadoPagoSdk.createPayment(preference);

    // Check the payment status
    if (payment != null && payment['status'] == 'approved') {
      // Payment was successful
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Payment Approved!')),
      );
    } else {
      // Payment failed
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Payment Failed!')),
      );
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Mercado Pago Payment'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _processPayment,
          child: Text('Pay Now'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app initializes the Mercado Pago SDK with the provided credentials.
// 2. The main screen displays a button labeled "Pay Now".
// 3. When the button is pressed, the _processPayment method is called.
// 4. A payment preference is created with item details.
// 5. The SDK processes the payment and returns the payment status.
// 6. Based on the payment status, a success or failure message is displayed to the user.
```
