# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Vertical Weight Slider

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the `vertical_weight_slider` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  vertical_weight_slider: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your `ios/Podfile` has the platform version set to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:vertical_weight_slider/vertical_weight_slider.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Vertical Weight Slider
You can now use the `VerticalWeightSlider` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
VerticalWeightSlider(
  min: 30, // Minimum weight
  max: 200, // Maximum weight
  value: 70, // Initial weight value
  onChanged: (value) {
    // Handle weight change
    print("Selected weight: $value");
  },
)
```

This widget will create a vertical slider that allows users to select a weight between 30 and 200 kg.

# Complete Example of Using Vertical Weight Slider

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:vertical_weight_slider/vertical_weight_slider.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Vertical Weight Slider Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Vertical Weight Slider'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: WeightSliderWidget(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class WeightSliderWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _WeightSliderWidgetState createState() => _WeightSliderWidgetState();
}

class _WeightSliderWidgetState extends State<WeightSliderWidget> {
  double _currentWeight = 70; // Initial weight value

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        // Display the current weight value
        Text(
          'Selected Weight: ${_currentWeight.toStringAsFixed(1)} kg',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20), // Add some space
        // Vertical weight slider
        VerticalWeightSlider(
          min: 30, // Minimum weight
          max: 200, // Maximum weight
          value: _currentWeight, // Current weight value
          onChanged: (value) {
            // Update the state with the new weight value
            setState(() {
              _currentWeight = value; // Update the current weight
            });
          },
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp and Scaffold.
// 3. The WeightSliderWidget is created in the center of the screen.
// 4. WeightSliderWidget is a StatefulWidget that maintains the current weight state.
// 5. The current weight is displayed as text above the slider.
// 6. The VerticalWeightSlider widget is used to allow users to select a weight.
// 7. When the slider value changes, the onChanged callback updates the current weight state.
// 8. The UI automatically rebuilds to reflect the new weight value.
```
