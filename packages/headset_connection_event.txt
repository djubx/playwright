# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Headset Connection Event Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `headset_connection_event` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `headset_connection_event` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  headset_connection_event: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, you need to ensure that your app has the necessary permissions to access audio settings. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permission:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to add a usage description in your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`. Add the following key-value pair:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to the microphone for audio playback.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to listen for headset connection events.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:headset_connection_event/headset_connection_event.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _status = "Headset is disconnected";

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the headset connection event listener
    HeadsetConnectionEvent.headsetConnectionEvent.listen((event) {
      setState(() {
        _status = event ? "Headset is connected" : "Headset is disconnected";
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Headset Connection Event")),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(_status, style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24)),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we listen for headset connection events and update the UI accordingly. The `_status` variable holds the current state of the headset connection, which is displayed in the center of the screen.

# Complete Example: Headset Connection Event in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:headset_connection_event/headset_connection_event.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _status = "Headset is disconnected"; // Initial status message

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Listen for headset connection events
    HeadsetConnectionEvent.headsetConnectionEvent.listen((event) {
      setState(() {
        // Update the status based on the event
        _status = event ? "Headset is connected" : "Headset is disconnected";
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Headset Connection Event")),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(_status, style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24)), // Display the current status
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, initializing the state with a disconnected status.
// 3. In the initState method, we set up a listener for headset connection events.
// 4. When a headset is connected or disconnected, the listener updates the _status variable.
// 5. The UI is rebuilt to reflect the current headset status, displaying it in the center of the screen.
