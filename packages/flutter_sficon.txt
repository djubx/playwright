## Using the Package

Once the package is installed, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use an icon from the `flutter_sficon` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_sficon/flutter_sficon.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('SFIcon Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: SfIcon(
          SfIcons.home, // Using the home icon from SFIcons
          size: 50.0, // Setting the size of the icon
          color: Colors.blue, // Setting the color of the icon
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code creates a simple Flutter application that displays a home icon in the center of the screen. You can customize the size and color as needed.

# Complete Example of Using the Flutter SFIcon Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_sficon/flutter_sficon.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'SFIcon Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('SFIcon Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying a home icon
              SfIcon(
                SfIcons.home,
                size: 50.0, // Setting the size of the icon
                color: Colors.blue, // Setting the color of the icon
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              // Displaying a settings icon
              SfIcon(
                SfIcons.settings,
                size: 50.0, // Setting the size of the icon
                color: Colors.green, // Setting the color of the icon
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp has a title and a home property that defines the main screen.
// 4. The Scaffold widget provides a structure for the app, including an AppBar and a body.
// 5. The body contains a Center widget that centers its child widgets.
// 6. Inside the Center, a Column widget is used to arrange the icons vertically.
// 7. Two SfIcon widgets are displayed: one for the home icon and another for the settings icon.
// 8. Each icon is customizable with size and color properties, demonstrating the flexibility of the package.
