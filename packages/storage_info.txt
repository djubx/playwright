# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Storage Info Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `storage_info` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  storage_info: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following permissions to request access to storage:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to manage storage.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera for storage management.</string>
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:storage_info/storage_info.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the package to fetch storage information. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to retrieve and display storage data:

```dart
void getStorageInfo() async {
  // Fetch total and available storage
  var storageInfo = await StorageInfo.getData();
  print('Total Storage: ${storageInfo.totalDiskSpace}');
  print('Available Storage: ${storageInfo.freeDiskSpace}');
}
```

This function retrieves the total and available storage space and prints it to the console.

With these steps, you are now ready to use the `storage_info` package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Using the Storage Info Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:storage_info/storage_info.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Storage Info Example',
      home: StorageInfoScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class StorageInfoScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _StorageInfoScreenState createState() => _StorageInfoScreenState();
}

class _StorageInfoScreenState extends State<StorageInfoScreen> {
  String _storageInfo = 'Fetching storage info...';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _fetchStorageInfo(); // Fetch storage info when the widget is initialized
  }

  // Function to fetch storage information
  void _fetchStorageInfo() async {
    // Get storage data
    var storageData = await StorageInfo.getData();
    // Update the state with the fetched data
    setState(() {
      _storageInfo = 'Total Storage: ${storageData.totalDiskSpace}\n'
                     'Available Storage: ${storageData.freeDiskSpace}';
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Storage Info'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          _storageInfo, // Display the storage information
          textAlign: TextAlign.center,
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home screen.
// 3. StorageInfoScreen is a StatefulWidget that fetches and displays storage information.
// 4. In the initState method, _fetchStorageInfo is called to retrieve storage data when the widget is created.
// 5. _fetchStorageInfo uses the StorageInfo package to get total and available storage space.
// 6. The state is updated with the fetched data, which triggers a rebuild of the widget.
// 7. The updated storage information is displayed in the center of the screen.
```
