# Align Positioned Flutter Package

The `align_positioned` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to simplify the process of positioning and aligning widgets within a Flutter application. It extends the capabilities of the standard `Align` and `Positioned` widgets by providing more intuitive and flexible alignment options. This package is particularly useful when you need precise control over the placement of widgets in relation to their parent containers.

## When to Use

- **Complex Layouts**: When building complex UI layouts that require precise widget positioning.
- **Responsive Design**: To create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.
- **Custom Animations**: For creating custom animations where widget positions need to be dynamically adjusted.

## Features

- **Fractional Alignment**: Allows widgets to be aligned using fractional values, making it easier to position them relative to their parent.
- **Offset Adjustments**: Provides options to adjust the position of widgets using offsets.
- **Ease of Use**: Simplifies the syntax and reduces the boilerplate code required for widget positioning.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Align Positioned

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up the `align_positioned` package in a Flutter project and demonstrate how to use its features effectively.

## Setup Process

1. **Add Dependency**: First, add the `align_positioned` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     align_positioned: ^2.0.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

3. **Import the Package**: Import the package in your Dart file where you plan to use it.

   ```dart
   import 'package:align_positioned/align_positioned.dart';
   ```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

- Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to support all features of Flutter.

### iOS

- Make sure your deployment target is set to iOS 9.0 or higher in your `ios/Podfile`.

## Using Align Positioned

To use the `align_positioned` package, wrap your widget with `RealFlutter` (a hypothetical class name for demonstration purposes) and specify the alignment and positioning parameters.

```dart
RealFlutter(
  alignment: Alignment.topRight,
  dx: 0.1, // Offset in the x-direction
  dy: 0.2, // Offset in the y-direction
  child: Container(
    width: 100,
    height: 100,
    color: Colors.blue,
  ),
)
```

This example positions a blue container at the top-right corner of its parent, with slight offsets in both x and y directions.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:align_positioned/align_positioned.dart';

void main() => runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Align Positioned Example')),
        body: AlignPositionedExample(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class AlignPositionedExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Stack(
      children: [
        // Using RealFlutter to position a widget
        RealFlutter(
          alignment: Alignment.topLeft, // Aligns the widget to the top-left
          dx: 0.1, // Moves the widget 10% of the parent's width to the right
          dy: 0.1, // Moves the widget 10% of the parent's height down
          child: Container(
            width: 100,
            height: 100,
            color: Colors.red,
          ),
        ),
        RealFlutter(
          alignment: Alignment.bottomRight, // Aligns the widget to the bottom-right
          dx: -0.1, // Moves the widget 10% of the parent's width to the left
          dy: -0.1, // Moves the widget 10% of the parent's height up
          child: Container(
            width: 100,
            height: 100,
            color: Colors.green,
          ),
        ),
        RealFlutter(
          alignment: Alignment.center, // Centers the widget
          child: Container(
            width: 100,
            height: 100,
            color: Colors.blue,
          ),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp and Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a body, which is the AlignPositionedExample widget.
// 4. AlignPositionedExample is a StatelessWidget that uses a Stack to layer multiple RealFlutter widgets.
// 5. Each RealFlutter widget positions a colored container at different locations within the Stack.
// 6. The red container is positioned at the top-left with a slight offset.
// 7. The green container is positioned at the bottom-right with a slight offset.
// 8. The blue container is centered within the Stack.
// 9. The RealFlutter class (hypothetical) is used to demonstrate the align_positioned package's capabilities.
