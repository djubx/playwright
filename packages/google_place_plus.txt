# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Google Place Plus

## Installation
To use the `google_place_plus` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  google_place_plus: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/google_place_plus).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
```

2. Add your Google Places API key in the `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<meta-data
    android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
    android:value="YOUR_API_KEY"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show nearby places.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show nearby places.</string>
```

2. Ensure you have your Google Places API key set up in the same file:

```xml
<key>GMSApiKey</key>
<string>YOUR_API_KEY</string>
```

## Using the Package
Once you have installed the package and configured your project, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement place autocomplete functionality.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:google_place_plus/google_place_plus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Google Place Plus Example',
      home: PlaceSearchScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PlaceSearchScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PlaceSearchScreenState createState() => _PlaceSearchScreenState();
}

class _PlaceSearchScreenState extends State<PlaceSearchScreen> {
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController();
  List<Prediction> _predictions = [];
  GooglePlace _googlePlace = GooglePlace("YOUR_API_KEY");

  // This function is called when the user types in the search box
  void _onSearchChanged() async {
    if (_controller.text.isNotEmpty) {
      // Fetch predictions based on user input
      var result = await _googlePlace.autocomplete.get(_controller.text);
      setState(() {
        _predictions = result.predictions!;
      });
    } else {
      // Clear predictions if the input is empty
      setState(() {
        _predictions = [];
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Place Search')),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            // Text field for user input
            TextField(
              controller: _controller,
              onChanged: (value) => _onSearchChanged(),
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                hintText: 'Search for places...',
              ),
            ),
            // Displaying predictions
            Expanded(
              child: ListView.builder(
                itemCount: _predictions.length,
                itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                  return ListTile(
                    title: Text(_predictions[index].description!),
                    onTap: () {
                      // Handle place selection
                      print('Selected place: ${_predictions[index].description}');
                    },
                  );
                },
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the `RealFlutter` widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The `PlaceSearchScreen` widget is displayed, containing a TextField for user input.
// 3. As the user types in the TextField, the `_onSearchChanged` function is triggered.
// 4. This function calls the Google Places API to fetch autocomplete predictions based on the input.
// 5. The predictions are displayed in a ListView below the TextField.
// 6. When a user taps on a prediction, it prints the selected place to the console.
