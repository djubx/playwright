# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Bluetooth Enable Fork Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `bluetooth_enable_fork` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `bluetooth_enable_fork` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  bluetooth_enable_fork: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request permission for Bluetooth usage:

```xml
<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires Bluetooth access to connect to devices.</string>
<key>NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires Bluetooth access to connect to devices.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to check and enable Bluetooth.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bluetooth_enable_fork/bluetooth_enable_fork.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Bluetooth Enable Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Check if Bluetooth is enabled
              bool isEnabled = await BluetoothEnableFork.isBluetoothEnabled();
              if (!isEnabled) {
                // Prompt user to enable Bluetooth
                await BluetoothEnableFork.enableBluetooth();
              }
            },
            child: Text('Check Bluetooth'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the user taps the button, the app checks if Bluetooth is enabled. If it is not, it prompts the user to enable it.

# Complete Example of Bluetooth Enable Fork Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bluetooth_enable_fork/bluetooth_enable_fork.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Bluetooth Enable Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Check if Bluetooth is enabled
              bool isEnabled = await BluetoothEnableFork.isBluetoothEnabled();
              if (!isEnabled) {
                // Prompt user to enable Bluetooth
                await BluetoothEnableFork.enableBluetooth();
              }
            },
            child: Text('Check Bluetooth'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The main widget is a MaterialApp that contains a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold has an AppBar with the title 'Bluetooth Enable Example'.
// 4. In the body of the Scaffold, there is a Center widget that contains an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the app checks if Bluetooth is enabled using the isBluetoothEnabled method.
// 6. If Bluetooth is not enabled, it calls the enableBluetooth method to prompt the user to enable it.
// 7. The user will see a system dialog asking them to enable Bluetooth, ensuring that the app can connect to Bluetooth devices.
