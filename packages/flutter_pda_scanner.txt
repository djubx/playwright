# flutter_pda_scanner: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the `flutter_pda_scanner` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_pda_scanner: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_pda_scanner).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FLASHLIGHT"/>
```

3. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request camera access:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the camera for scanning barcodes.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the photo library for saving scanned images.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `flutter_pda_scanner` package, you can create a simple scanning interface. Hereâ€™s how to implement it:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_pda_scanner/flutter_pda_scanner.dart';
```

2. Create a widget that initializes the scanner and handles the scanning process.

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String scannedData = '';

  void startScanning() async {
    String result = await FlutterPdaScanner.scan();
    setState(() {
      scannedData = result;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('PDA Scanner')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Scanned Data: $scannedData'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: startScanning,
              child: Text('Start Scanning'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic scanning interface where users can start scanning by pressing a button. The scanned data will be displayed on the screen.

# Complete Example of flutter_pda_scanner

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_pda_scanner/flutter_pda_scanner.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String scannedData = ''; // Variable to hold scanned data

  // Function to start scanning
  void startScanning() async {
    // Call the scan method from the flutter_pda_scanner package
    String result = await FlutterPdaScanner.scan();
    setState(() {
      scannedData = result; // Update the scanned data
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('PDA Scanner')), // App bar title
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Scanned Data: $scannedData'), // Display scanned data
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between elements
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: startScanning, // Start scanning on button press
              child: Text('Start Scanning'), // Button text
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp initializes the RealFlutter widget.
// 3. In RealFlutter, a stateful widget is created to manage the scanning process.
// 4. The startScanning function is defined to invoke the scanner and update the UI with the scanned data.
// 5. The build method constructs the UI, displaying the scanned data and a button to initiate scanning.
// 6. When the button is pressed, the startScanning function is called, and the scanned result is displayed on the screen.
