# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Liquid Pull to Refresh

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To use the `liquid_pull_to_refresh` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  liquid_pull_to_refresh: ^2.0.0
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Basic Setup

In your Flutter application, you can use the `LiquidPullToRefresh` widget to wrap your scrollable content. Below is a basic setup for both Android and iOS platforms.

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Hereâ€™s how to implement the `LiquidPullToRefresh` in your Flutter app:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:liquid_pull_to_refresh/liquid_pull_to_refresh.dart';
```

2. Wrap your scrollable widget (like `ListView`) with `LiquidPullToRefresh`:

```dart
LiquidPullToRefresh(
  onRefresh: _refreshData,
  child: ListView.builder(
    itemCount: items.length,
    itemBuilder: (context, index) {
      return ListTile(title: Text(items[index]));
    },
  ),
);
```

3. Implement the `_refreshData` function to handle the refresh logic:

```dart
Future<void> _refreshData() async {
  // Simulate a network call or data fetching
  await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));
  // Update your data here
}
```

### Customization

You can customize the appearance of the refresh indicator by using properties like `color`, `backgroundColor`, and `height`.

```dart
LiquidPullToRefresh(
  color: Colors.blue,
  backgroundColor: Colors.white,
  height: 100.0,
  onRefresh: _refreshData,
  child: ...
);
```

Now you have a basic setup for using the `liquid_pull_to_refresh` package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Liquid Pull to Refresh

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:liquid_pull_to_refresh/liquid_pull_to_refresh.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Liquid Pull to Refresh Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  List<String> items = List.generate(20, (index) => 'Item $index');

  // Function to simulate data refresh
  Future<void> _refreshData() async {
    // Simulate a network call or data fetching
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));
    // Update your data here (for example, adding a new item)
    setState(() {
      items.add('Item ${items.length}');
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Liquid Pull to Refresh Example'),
      ),
      body: LiquidPullToRefresh(
        onRefresh: _refreshData, // Call the refresh function
        color: Colors.blue, // Color of the refresh indicator
        backgroundColor: Colors.white, // Background color of the indicator
        height: 100.0, // Height of the refresh indicator
        child: ListView.builder(
          itemCount: items.length, // Number of items in the list
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            return ListTile(title: Text(items[index])); // Display each item
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter is a stateful widget that maintains a list of items.
// 4. The _refreshData function simulates a network call and updates the list of items.
// 5. The LiquidPullToRefresh widget wraps a ListView, providing a pull-to-refresh feature.
// 6. When the user pulls down, the _refreshData function is called, simulating data fetching.
// 7. The ListView displays the updated list of items after the refresh is complete.
```
