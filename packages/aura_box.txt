# Setting Up and Using the Aura Box Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up the `aura_box` package in a Flutter project and demonstrate how to use its features effectively.

## Installation

To get started, add the `aura_box` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  aura_box: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Setup

### Android

No additional setup is required for Android. Ensure your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, ensure your `Podfile` is using platform version 10.0 or higher:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package

To use the `aura_box` package, import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:aura_box/aura_box.dart';
```

### Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use the `RealFlutter` class to add a shadow effect to a widget:

```dart
RealFlutter(
  shadowColor: Colors.black,
  shadowBlur: 10.0,
  child: Text('Hello, Aura Box!'),
)
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to wrap a `Text` widget with `RealFlutter` to apply a shadow effect.

# Complete Example: Flutter Main File

Below is a complete example demonstrating the key features of the `aura_box` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:aura_box/aura_box.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Aura Box Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Aura Box Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: RealFlutter(
          shadowColor: Colors.blueAccent, // Set the shadow color
          shadowBlur: 15.0, // Define the blur radius for the shadow
          gradient: LinearGradient( // Apply a gradient effect
            colors: [Colors.blue, Colors.purple],
            begin: Alignment.topLeft,
            end: Alignment.bottomRight,
          ),
          animationDuration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Set animation duration
          child: Container(
            width: 200,
            height: 200,
            alignment: Alignment.center,
            child: Text(
              'Aura Box',
              style: TextStyle(
                color: Colors.white,
                fontSize: 24,
                fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The `main` function is the entry point of the Flutter application.
// `MyApp` is the root widget of the application, setting up the MaterialApp.
// `MyHomePage` is the main screen, displaying a centered `RealFlutter` widget.
// `RealFlutter` is used to wrap a `Container`, applying shadow, gradient, and animation.
// The `Container` holds a `Text` widget, styled with white color and bold font.
// The `RealFlutter` widget demonstrates shadow, gradient, and animation features of the package.
