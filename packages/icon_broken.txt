# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the `icon_broken` Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `icon_broken` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  icon_broken: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:icon_broken/icon_broken.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using Icons in Your Application

You can now use the icons provided by the `icon_broken` package in your widgets. Here’s how to use an icon in a simple Flutter application:

### Example Code Snippet

```dart
Icon(IconBroken.Home, size: 30, color: Colors.blue);
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

#### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Customizing Icons

You can customize the icons by changing their size and color. Here’s an example:

```dart
Icon(
  IconBroken.Heart,
  size: 40, // Custom size
  color: Colors.red, // Custom color
);
```

This customization allows you to fit the icons into your app's design seamlessly.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate and use the `icon_broken` package in your Flutter application effectively.

# Complete Example of Using the `icon_broken` Package

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:icon_broken/icon_broken.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Icon Broken Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Icon Broken Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Displaying a home icon
            Icon(
              IconBroken.Home,
              size: 50, // Setting the size of the icon
              color: Colors.blue, // Setting the color of the icon
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
            // Displaying a heart icon
            Icon(
              IconBroken.Heart,
              size: 50, // Setting the size of the icon
              color: Colors.red, // Setting the color of the icon
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
            // Displaying a settings icon
            Icon(
              IconBroken.Setting,
              size: 50, // Setting the size of the icon
              color: Colors.green, // Setting the color of the icon
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp has a title and a theme, and it sets HomePage as the home widget.
// 4. HomePage is a StatelessWidget that builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the icons vertically.
// 6. Each Icon widget uses the IconBroken class to display different icons (Home, Heart, Setting).
// 7. The icons are customized with size and color properties to enhance their appearance.
