            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and sees the rating bar with an initial rating of 3.5.
// 2. The user taps on a star to change the rating.
// 3. The ratingCallback function is called with the new rating.
// 4. The setState function is called to update the _rating variable with the new rating.
// 5. The widget tree is rebuilt with the new rating.
// 6. The user sees the updated rating bar with the new rating.
// 7. The user can repeat steps 2-6 to change the rating again.
