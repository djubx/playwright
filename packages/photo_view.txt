# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Photo View Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To use the `photo_view` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  photo_view: ^0.14.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install the Package

Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the `photo_view` package:

```dart
import 'package:photo_view/photo_view.dart';
import 'package:photo_view/photo_view_gallery.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Photo View

You can use the `PhotoView` widget to display a single image or `PhotoViewGallery` for multiple images. Below is a simple example of how to implement it.

```dart
// Example of using PhotoView
PhotoView(
  imageProvider: NetworkImage('https://example.com/image.jpg'),
  minScale: PhotoViewComputedScale.contained,
  maxScale: PhotoViewComputedScale.covered * 2,
);
```

### Complete Example

Refer to the next section for a complete example that demonstrates all key features of the `photo_view` package.

# Complete Example of Using the Photo View Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:photo_view/photo_view.dart';
import 'package:photo_view/photo_view_gallery.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Photo View Example',
      home: PhotoViewExample(),
    );
  }
}

class PhotoViewExample extends StatelessWidget {
  // List of image URLs to display
  final List<String> imageUrls = [
    'https://example.com/image1.jpg',
    'https://example.com/image2.jpg',
    'https://example.com/image3.jpg',
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Photo View Example'),
      ),
      body: PhotoViewGallery.builder(
        itemCount: imageUrls.length, // Number of images
        builder: (context, index) {
          return PhotoViewGalleryPageOptions(
            imageProvider: NetworkImage(imageUrls[index]), // Load image from network
            minScale: PhotoViewComputedScale.contained, // Minimum scale
            maxScale: PhotoViewComputedScale.covered * 2, // Maximum scale
          );
        },
        scrollPhysics: BouncingScrollPhysics(), // Scroll physics
        backgroundDecoration: BoxDecoration(
          color: Colors.black, // Background color
        ),
        pageController: PageController(), // Page controller for swiping
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. The home of the MaterialApp is PhotoViewExample, which contains the image gallery.
// 4. In PhotoViewExample, a list of image URLs is defined.
// 5. The PhotoViewGallery.builder creates a gallery of images.
// 6. Each image is wrapped in PhotoViewGalleryPageOptions, allowing for zoom and pan.
// 7. The app displays a black background and allows users to swipe through images.
```
