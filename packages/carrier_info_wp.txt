# Setting Up and Using the `carrier_info_wp` Package

## Installation
To use the `carrier_info_wp` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  carrier_info_wp: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/carrier_info_wp).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions:
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
   ```

2. If you are targeting Android 10 (API level 29) or higher, you may need to add the following to your `AndroidManifest.xml` to allow access to carrier information:
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE"/>
   ```

### iOS
1. For iOS, you need to add the following key to your `Info.plist` file to request permission to access carrier information:
   ```xml
   <key>NSContactsUsageDescription</key>
   <string>This app requires access to your carrier information.</string>
   ```

## Using the Package
To use the `carrier_info_wp` package, you can follow these steps in your Flutter application:

1. Import the package:
   ```dart
   import 'package:carrier_info_wp/carrier_info_wp.dart';
   ```

2. Create a method to fetch carrier information:
   ```dart
   Future<void> getCarrierInfo() async {
     String carrierName = await CarrierInfo.getCarrierName();
     String countryCode = await CarrierInfo.getCountryCode();
     // Use the carrier information as needed
   }
   ```

3. Call this method in your widget's lifecycle, such as in `initState()`.

# Complete Example of Using `carrier_info_wp`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:carrier_info_wp/carrier_info_wp.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String carrierName = 'Unknown';
  String countryCode = 'Unknown';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Fetch carrier information when the app starts
    getCarrierInfo();
  }

  Future<void> getCarrierInfo() async {
    // Retrieve the carrier name
    String fetchedCarrierName = await CarrierInfo.getCarrierName();
    // Retrieve the country code
    String fetchedCountryCode = await CarrierInfo.getCountryCode();

    // Update the state with the fetched information
    setState(() {
      carrierName = fetchedCarrierName;
      countryCode = fetchedCountryCode;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Carrier Info Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text('Carrier Name: $carrierName'),
              Text('Country Code: $countryCode'),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts by running the `main()` function, which initializes the `RealFlutter` widget.
// 2. In the `initState()` method of `_RealFlutterState`, the `getCarrierInfo()` method is called.
// 3. The `getCarrierInfo()` method retrieves the carrier name and country code asynchronously.
// 4. Once the data is fetched, the state is updated using `setState()`, which triggers a rebuild of the UI.
// 5. The UI displays the carrier name and country code in the center of the screen.
```
