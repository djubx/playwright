## Setup Process

To get started with the `share_handler` package, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `share_handler` package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     share_handler: ^latest_version
   ```

   Replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/share_handler).

2. **Install Packages**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:

   ### For Android:
   - Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions for sharing. Add the following lines inside the `<manifest>` tag:

     ```xml
     <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
     ```

   ### For iOS:
   - Open your `Info.plist` file and add the following entries to allow sharing:

     ```xml
     <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
     <string>We need access to your photo library to share images.</string>
     <key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
     <string>We need access to your photo library to save images.</string>
     ```

## Using the Package

To use the `share_handler` package, you can follow this simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:share_handler/share_handler.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Share Handler Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Share text content
              ShareHandler.shareText("Check out this amazing Flutter package!");
            },
            child: Text('Share'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, when the user taps the "Share" button, a share dialog will appear, allowing them to share the specified text.

          title: Text('Share Handler Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Share text content
                  ShareHandler.shareText("Check out this amazing Flutter package!");
                },
                child: Text('Share Text'),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Share an image (ensure the image path is valid)
                  ShareHandler.shareImage('path/to/image.png');
                },
                child: Text('Share Image'),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Share a file (ensure the file path is valid)
                  ShareHandler.shareFile('path/to/file.pdf');
                },
                child: Text('Share File'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Share Handler Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold has a Center widget that contains a Column with three buttons.
// 5. Each button is associated with a different sharing action:
//    - The first button shares text content when pressed.
//    - The second button shares an image when pressed (ensure the image path is valid).
//    - The third button shares a file when pressed (ensure the file path is valid).
// 6. When a button is pressed, the corresponding share action is triggered, and the share dialog appears, allowing the user to choose how to share the content.
