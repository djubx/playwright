# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Flutter Voximplant Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_voximplant` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_voximplant` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_voximplant: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update Android Manifest**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
```

2. **Enable ProGuard**: If you are using ProGuard, ensure that you add the necessary rules for the Voximplant SDK.

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys for microphone and camera usage:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for voice calls.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera for video calls.</string>
```

2. **Enable Background Modes**: In Xcode, go to your project settings, select the "Capabilities" tab, and enable "Background Modes". Check "Audio, AirPlay, and Picture in Picture".

## Step 3: Initialize the Voximplant SDK

In your Flutter application, you need to initialize the Voximplant SDK. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_voximplant/flutter_voximplant.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Voximplant Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the Voximplant SDK
    Voximplant.initialize();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Voximplant Demo')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Welcome to Voximplant!')),
    );
  }
}
```

In this code, we initialize the Voximplant SDK in the `initState` method of our main widget.

# Complete Example: A Functional Flutter Application Using Voximplant

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_voximplant/flutter_voximplant.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Voximplant Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Declare variables for managing call state
  Call? _call;
  bool _isInCall = false;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the Voximplant SDK
    Voximplant.initialize();
    // Set up call event listeners
    Voximplant.onCallEvent.listen((event) {
      if (event is CallConnected) {
        setState(() {
          _isInCall = true; // Update state when call is connected
        });
      } else if (event is CallDisconnected) {
        setState(() {
          _isInCall = false; // Update state when call is disconnected
        });
      }
    });
  }

  // Function to make a call
  void _makeCall() async {
    // Create a new call
    _call = await Voximplant.call('user@example.com');
  }

  // Function to hang up the call
  void _hangUp() {
    _call?.hangup();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Voximplant Demo')),
      body: Center(
        child: _isInCall
            ? Column(
                mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
                children: [
                  Text('In Call'),
                  ElevatedButton(
                    onPressed: _hangUp,
                    child: Text('Hang Up'),
                  ),
                ],
              )
            : ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _makeCall,
                child: Text('Make Call'),
              ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation

// The application starts by initializing the Voximplant SDK in the `initState` method.
// It sets up a listener for call events to manage the call state.
// When the user taps the "Make Call" button, a call is initiated to the specified user.
// If the call is connected, the UI updates to show that the user is in a call.
// The user can then hang up the call by pressing the "Hang Up" button, which will disconnect the call and update the UI accordingly.

In this example, we have created a simple Flutter application that demonstrates how to use the `flutter_voximplant` package to make and manage calls. The application flow is straightforward, allowing users to initiate and end calls with ease.
