# Duration Button Flutter Package

The **duration_button** Flutter package is a versatile widget that allows developers to create buttons with customizable duration settings. This package is particularly useful in applications where time-sensitive actions are required, such as countdowns, timers, or any feature that necessitates user interaction based on time constraints.

## When to Use

You might consider using the **duration_button** package in scenarios such as:
- **Countdown Timers**: For applications that require users to complete tasks within a specific time frame.
- **Game Applications**: Where players need to make decisions quickly.
- **Form Submissions**: To limit the time a user has to fill out a form.

## Features

- **Customizable Duration**: Set the duration for the button's active state.
- **Visual Feedback**: Provides visual cues to users about the remaining time.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate into existing Flutter applications.
- **Platform Compatibility**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.

With these features, the **duration_button** package enhances user experience by providing clear time constraints and feedback.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Duration Button Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the **duration_button** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  duration_button: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure to enable Swift support in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:duration_button/duration_button.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Duration Button

You can now use the `DurationButton` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
DurationButton(
  duration: Duration(seconds: 10), // Set the duration for the button
  onPressed: () {
    // Action to perform when the button is pressed
    print("Button Pressed!");
  },
  child: Text("Press Me"),
);
```

This button will be active for 10 seconds, after which it will provide visual feedback indicating that the time has elapsed.

With these steps, you are now ready to implement the **duration_button** package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Duration Button

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:duration_button/duration_button.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Duration Button Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Duration Button Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: DurationButton(
            duration: Duration(seconds: 10), // Set the button active duration
            onPressed: () {
              // Action to perform when the button is pressed
              print("Button Pressed!");
            },
            child: Text("Press Me"),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Duration Button Demo".
// 4. In the body of the Scaffold, a DurationButton is created with a duration of 10 seconds.
// 5. When the button is pressed, it triggers the onPressed callback, printing "Button Pressed!" to the console.
// 6. The button visually indicates the countdown, providing feedback to the user about the remaining time.
