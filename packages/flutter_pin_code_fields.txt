You should consider using the `flutter_pin_code_fields` package when:
- You need to implement a secure PIN input field in your application.
- You want to provide a user-friendly interface for entering PIN codes.
- You require customization options for the appearance and behavior of the input fields.

## Features

- **Customizable UI**: You can easily customize the appearance of the pin code fields, including colors, sizes, and shapes.
- **Input Validation**: The package provides built-in validation to ensure that the entered PIN meets your requirements.
- **Keyboard Type Support**: It supports different keyboard types, making it easier for users to enter numeric PINs.
- **Focus Management**: Automatically moves focus to the next field after entering a digit, enhancing user experience.

Overall, the `flutter_pin_code_fields` package simplifies the process of implementing secure and user-friendly PIN input fields in Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_pin_code_fields

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_pin_code_fields` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_pin_code_fields: ^7.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable the `NSAppTransportSecurity` settings in your `Info.plist` if you are making network requests. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the pin code fields in your app.

# Complete Example of flutter_pin_code_fields

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_pin_code_fields/flutter_pin_code_fields.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Pin Code Fields Example',
      home: PinCodeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PinCodeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PinCodeScreenState createState() => _PinCodeScreenState();
}

class _PinCodeScreenState extends State<PinCodeScreen> {
  // Variable to hold the entered PIN
  String pinCode = '';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Enter Your PIN'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Pin code input field
            PinCodeTextField(
              length: 4, // Length of the PIN
              onChanged: (value) {
                // Update the pinCode variable as the user types
                setState(() {
                  pinCode = value;
                });
              },
              // Customize the appearance
              pinTheme: PinTheme(
                shape: PinCodeFieldShape.box,
                borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(5),
                fieldHeight: 50,
                fieldWidth: 40,
                activeFillColor: Colors.white,
                inactiveFillColor: Colors.grey[200],
                selectedFillColor: Colors.blue[100],
              ),
              // Handle completed input
              onCompleted: (value) {
                // Perform action with the completed PIN
                print("Entered PIN: $value");
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Display the entered PIN
            Text('Entered PIN: $pinCode'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (PinCodeScreen).
// 3. PinCodeScreen is a stateful widget that maintains the state of the entered PIN.
// 4. The PinCodeTextField widget is used to create the PIN input field.
// 5. The length of the PIN is set to 4, and the onChanged callback updates the pinCode variable.
// 6. The pinTheme property customizes the appearance of the input fields.
// 7. The onCompleted callback is triggered when the user finishes entering the PIN, allowing for further actions (like validation).
// 8. The entered PIN is displayed below the input field for user feedback.
