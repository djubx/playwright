# Setting Up CinetPay Flutter Package
=====================================

## Step 1: Add the Package to Your Flutter Project

Add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  cinetpay: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Import the Package

Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:cinetpay/cinetpay.dart';
```

## Step 3: Initialize the Package

Initialize the package with your API key and secret key:

```dart
CinetPay cinetPay = CinetPay(
  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  secretKey: 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
);
```

## Step 4: Configure Payment Methods

Configure the payment methods you want to support:

```dart
cinetPay.addPaymentMethod(
  PaymentMethod(
    type: PaymentMethodType.card,
    label: 'Credit/Debit Card',
  ),
);

cinetPay.addPaymentMethod(
  PaymentMethod(
    type: PaymentMethodType.mobileMoney,
    label: 'Mobile Money',
  ),
);
```

## Step 5: Create a Payment Request

Create a payment request with the amount and currency:

```dart
PaymentRequest paymentRequest = PaymentRequest(
  amount: 10.99,
  currency: 'USD',
);
```

## Step 6: Process the Payment

Process the payment using the `pay` method:

```dart
cinetPay.pay(
  paymentRequest: paymentRequest,
  onSuccess: (paymentResponse) {
    // Handle payment success
  },
  onError: (error) {
    // Handle payment error
  },
);
```

            onPressed: () {
              _cinetPay.pay(
                paymentRequest: _paymentRequest,
                onSuccess: (paymentResponse) {
                  // Handle payment success
                  print('Payment successful!');
                },
                onError: (error) {
                  // Handle payment error
                  print('Payment failed!');
                },
              );
            },
            child: Text('Make Payment'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user clicks the "Make Payment" button.
// 2. The `_cinetPay.pay` method is called with the payment request.
// 3. The user is redirected to the CinetPay payment page.
// 4. The user selects a payment method and completes the payment.
// 5. The payment response is received and handled by the `onSuccess` or `onError` callback.
// 6. The payment result is displayed to the user.

// In summary, this code sets up a basic payment flow using the CinetPay Flutter package.
// It creates a payment request, processes the payment, and handles the payment response.
