# Export Video Frame Flutter Package

The `export_video_frame` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to capture and export frames from video files. This package is particularly useful in applications that require video processing, such as video editing apps, media players, or any app that needs to extract specific frames for analysis or display.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the `export_video_frame` package in scenarios such as:
- **Video Editing Applications**: Where users need to select and export specific frames from a video.
- **Media Analysis Tools**: For extracting frames for analysis, such as in machine learning or computer vision applications.
- **Thumbnail Generation**: To create thumbnails for video previews.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that allows for quick setup and usage.
- **Frame Extraction**: Extracts frames at specified timestamps.
- **Customizable Output**: Allows customization of the output format and quality.

With these features, the `export_video_frame` package provides a robust solution for frame extraction needs in Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Export Video Frame Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `export_video_frame` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  export_video_frame: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    compileSdkVersion 31  // Ensure this is set to a recent version

    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21  // Minimum SDK version
        targetSdkVersion 31  // Target SDK version
    }
}
```

2. Ensure you have the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save frames.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to capture video frames.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to extract a frame from a video.

# Complete Example: Exporting Video Frames

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:export_video_frame/export_video_frame.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Export Video Frame Example',
      home: VideoFrameExtractor(),
    );
  }
}

class VideoFrameExtractor extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _VideoFrameExtractorState createState() => _VideoFrameExtractorState();
}

class _VideoFrameExtractorState extends State<VideoFrameExtractor> {
  String? _framePath; // Variable to hold the path of the extracted frame

  // Function to extract a frame from the video
  Future<void> _extractFrame() async {
    // Specify the video file path and the time to extract the frame
    String videoPath = 'path/to/your/video.mp4'; // Replace with your video path
    int timestamp = 5; // Extract frame at 5 seconds

    // Call the export function from the package
    String? frame = await ExportVideoFrame.exportFrame(videoPath, timestamp);

    // Update the state with the extracted frame path
    setState(() {
      _framePath = frame; // Store the frame path
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Export Video Frame Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _extractFrame, // Trigger frame extraction
              child: Text('Extract Frame'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Display the extracted frame if available
            _framePath != null
                ? Image.file(File(_framePath!)) // Show the extracted frame
                : Text('No frame extracted yet.'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a home screen of VideoFrameExtractor.
// 3. VideoFrameExtractor is a stateful widget that manages the extraction of video frames.
// 4. When the "Extract Frame" button is pressed, the _extractFrame function is called.
// 5. This function specifies the video path and the timestamp for frame extraction.
// 6. It calls the exportFrame method from the export_video_frame package.
// 7. Upon successful extraction, the frame path is stored in the state and displayed as an image.
// 8. If no frame has been extracted yet, a message is shown instead.
```
