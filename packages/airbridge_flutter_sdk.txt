// This is the main entry point of the app.
// We initialize the Airbridge Flutter SDK with our API key and app ID.
// Then, we run the app with the `MyApp` widget.

// The `MyApp` widget is a stateless widget that returns a `MaterialApp` widget.
// The `MaterialApp` widget is the root widget of the app.
// We set the title of the app to 'RealFlutter App' and the home page to `MyHomePage`.

// The `MyHomePage` widget is a stateful widget that returns a `Scaffold` widget.
// The `Scaffold` widget is a basic material design layout structure.
// We set the app bar title to 'RealFlutter App' and the body to a `Center` widget.
// The `Center` widget is a widget that centers its child.

// We use a `Column` widget to layout the child widgets vertically.
// We use `Text` widgets to display text and `SizedBox` widgets to add space between widgets.
// We use `ElevatedButton` widgets to create buttons.
// When the buttons are pressed, we track events and users using the Airbridge Flutter SDK.

// This is the end of the app.
// We have successfully integrated the Airbridge Flutter SDK into our app.
