# Setting Up airbridge_flutter_sdk

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `airbridge_flutter_sdk` package, including platform-specific configurations for both Android and iOS.

## Installation

To add the `airbridge_flutter_sdk` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  airbridge_flutter_sdk: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/airbridge_flutter_sdk).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions and metadata:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.yourapp">

    <application>
        ...
        <meta-data
            android:name="airbridge_app_key"
            android:value="YOUR_AIRBRIDGE_APP_KEY" />
    </application>
</manifest>
```

Replace `YOUR_AIRBRIDGE_APP_KEY` with your actual Airbridge app key.

### iOS

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open your `Info.plist` file located in `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following entries:

```xml
<key>airbridge_app_key</key>
<string>YOUR_AIRBRIDGE_APP_KEY</string>
```

Again, replace `YOUR_AIRBRIDGE_APP_KEY` with your actual Airbridge app key.

## Initialization

After setting up the package, you need to initialize it in your Flutter application. This is typically done in the `main()` function:

```dart
import 'package:airbridge_flutter_sdk/airbridge_flutter_sdk.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  AirbridgeFlutterSdk.initialize("YOUR_AIRBRIDGE_APP_KEY");
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

This code initializes the Airbridge SDK with your app key, allowing you to start tracking user interactions.

# Complete Example of airbridge_flutter_sdk

Below is a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the `airbridge_flutter_sdk` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:airbridge_flutter_sdk/airbridge_flutter_sdk.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  // Initialize the Airbridge SDK with your app key
  AirbridgeFlutterSdk.initialize("YOUR_AIRBRIDGE_APP_KEY");
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Airbridge Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Airbridge SDK Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Track a custom event when the button is pressed
            AirbridgeFlutterSdk.trackEvent("button_pressed", {
              "button_name": "example_button",
            });
            // Show a snackbar to confirm the event tracking
            ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
              SnackBar(content: Text('Event tracked!')),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Track Event'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main() function, which initializes the Airbridge SDK.
// 2. The MyApp widget is created, which sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The HomePage widget is displayed as the home screen of the app.
// 4. Inside the HomePage, there is a button that, when pressed, triggers an event tracking call to Airbridge.
// 5. The event "button_pressed" is tracked with additional parameters, and a snackbar is shown to confirm the action.
```
