# Setting Up Dart Code Metrics Presets

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `dart_code_metrics_presets` package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter project.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `dart_code_metrics_presets` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  dart_code_metrics_presets: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/dart_code_metrics_presets).

## Step 2: Running the Metrics

After adding the dependency, you can run the metrics using the command line. Open your terminal and navigate to your Flutter project directory. Then, execute the following command:

```bash
flutter pub run dart_code_metrics:metrics analyze
```

This command will analyze your Dart code and provide a report based on the predefined metrics.

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your project is configured to use the latest version of the Dart SDK. You can check this in your `android/build.gradle` file. Make sure to set the `compileSdkVersion` and `targetSdkVersion` to the latest stable versions.

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that you have the latest version of Xcode installed. You can check your Xcode version by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
xcodebuild -version
```

Make sure your Flutter project is set up to use the latest iOS deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`.

## Step 3: Customizing Metrics

You can customize the metrics by creating a configuration file named `dart_code_metrics.yaml` in the root of your project. Hereâ€™s an example configuration:

```yaml
metrics:
  cyclomatic-complexity:
    threshold: 10
  lines-of-code:
    threshold: 100
```

This configuration sets a threshold for cyclomatic complexity and lines of code, allowing you to enforce stricter quality standards.

## Step 4: Integrating with CI/CD

To integrate the metrics into your CI/CD pipeline, add the following command to your build script:

```bash
flutter pub run dart_code_metrics:metrics analyze
```

This ensures that your code is analyzed for quality metrics every time you push changes to your repository.

By following these steps, you can effectively set up and use the `dart_code_metrics_presets` package in your Flutter project.

# Complete Example of Using Dart Code Metrics Presets

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dart Code Metrics Presets Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Dart Code Metrics Presets Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Welcome to Dart Code Metrics Presets!',
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // This button simulates a code quality check
                _checkCodeQuality();
              },
              child: Text('Check Code Quality'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void _checkCodeQuality() {
    // Simulate a code quality check
    // In a real application, you would run the metrics analysis here
    print('Running code quality metrics...');
    // Here you would typically call the metrics analysis command
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds the MaterialApp, setting the title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to MyHomePage, which is the main screen of the app.
// 4. MyHomePage contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the Text and ElevatedButton vertically.
// 6. When the button is pressed, the _checkCodeQuality method is called, simulating a code quality check.
// 7. The _checkCodeQuality method prints a message to the console, indicating that the metrics analysis would run here.
```
