  sleek_circular_slider: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {

## Step 5: Using the Circular Slider
You can now use the `SleekCircularSlider` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to implement it:

```dart
SleekCircularSlider(
  appearance: CircularSliderAppearance(
    customColors: CustomSliderColors(
      progressBarColor: Colors.blue,
      trackColor: Colors.grey,
    ),
    size: 150,
    animationEnabled: true,
  ),
  initialValue: 20,
  onChange: (double value) {

# Complete Example of Sleek Circular Slider

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sleek_circular_slider/sleek_circular_slider.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sleek Circular Slider Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Sleek Circular Slider'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: SleekCircularSlider(
            appearance: CircularSliderAppearance(
              customColors: CustomSliderColors(
                progressBarColor: Colors.blue, // Color of the progress bar
                trackColor: Colors.grey, // Color of the track
              ),
              size: 150, // Size of the circular slider
              animationEnabled: true, // Enable animation
            ),
            initialValue: 20, // Initial value of the slider
            onChange: (double value) {
              // Callback function to handle value changes
              print(value); // Print the current value to the console
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with MyApp as the root widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Sleek Circular Slider".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers a SleekCircularSlider widget.
// 5. The SleekCircularSlider is configured with a blue progress bar and a grey track.
// 6. The initial value of the slider is set to 20, and it prints the current value to the console whenever it changes.
