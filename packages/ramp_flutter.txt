# Setting Up and Using the ramp_flutter Package

## Installation

To get started with the `ramp_flutter` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ramp_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/ramp_flutter).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions added:

```groovy
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

3. Update your `minSdkVersion` to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage

To use the `ramp_flutter` package, you will typically follow these steps:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:ramp_flutter/ramp_flutter.dart';
```

2. Initialize the Ramp service with your API key:

```dart
void main() {
  Ramp.initialize(apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY');
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

3. Create a payment request:

```dart
void createPayment() {
  Ramp.createPayment(
    amount: 100.0, // Amount in the smallest currency unit (e.g., cents)
    currency: 'USD',
    onSuccess: (transaction) {
      // Handle successful transaction
    },
    onError: (error) {
      // Handle error
    },
  );
}
```

With these steps, you can set up and start using the `ramp_flutter` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using ramp_flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ramp_flutter/ramp_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the Ramp service with your API key
  Ramp.initialize(apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY');
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Ramp Flutter Example',
      home: PaymentScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PaymentScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Ramp Payment Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Trigger the payment creation process
            createPayment();
          },
          child: Text('Make Payment'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void createPayment() {
    // Create a payment request with specified amount and currency
    Ramp.createPayment(
      amount: 10000, // Amount in cents (e.g., $100.00)
      currency: 'USD',
      onSuccess: (transaction) {
        // Handle successful transaction
        print('Transaction successful: ${transaction.id}');
      },
      onError: (error) {
        // Handle error
        print('Transaction failed: ${error.message}');
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts by initializing the Ramp service with an API key.
// 2. The main widget is a MaterialApp that contains a PaymentScreen.
// 3. The PaymentScreen displays a button that, when pressed, triggers the createPayment function.
// 4. The createPayment function calls Ramp.createPayment with the specified amount and currency.
// 5. On success, it prints the transaction ID; on error, it prints the error message.
```

### Summary of the Code Flow
The provided code initializes the Ramp service and sets up a simple Flutter application with a button to initiate a payment. When the button is pressed, it calls the `createPayment` function, which interacts with the Ramp API to process the payment. The application handles both success and error responses, providing feedback through the console. This structure allows for easy integration of payment functionalities into any Flutter app using the `ramp_flutter` package.
