// This code creates a Flutter app with a material design theme.
// The app has a home page with a scaffold and an app bar.
// The body of the scaffold contains a center widget with a column of children.
// The children include two path icons with custom SVG paths, colors, and sizes.

// The first path icon has a red color and a size of 24.
// The second path icon has a blue color and a size of 48.

// The code uses the PathIcon widget to create the path icons.
// The PathIcon widget takes a path property, which is a string that defines the SVG path of the icon.
// The widget also takes color and size properties, which can be used to customize the icon's appearance.

// Overall, this code demonstrates how to use the PathIcon widget to create custom icons in a Flutter app.
