# Path Icon Flutter Package

The **path_icon** Flutter package is a powerful tool that allows developers to create custom icons using SVG paths. This package is particularly useful when you want to use vector graphics in your Flutter applications without relying on image assets. By leveraging SVG paths, you can create scalable icons that maintain their quality across different screen sizes and resolutions.

## When to Use This Package
- When you need to create custom icons that are not available in standard icon libraries.
- When you want to reduce the number of image assets in your project, leading to a smaller app size.
- When you require icons that can be easily customized in terms of color, size, and other properties.

## Features
- **Custom SVG Path Support**: Create icons from SVG path data.
- **Color Customization**: Easily change the color of the icons.
- **Scalability**: Icons can be scaled without losing quality.
- **Lightweight**: Reduces the need for multiple image assets, making your app lighter.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Path Icon

## Installation
To use the **path_icon** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  path_icon: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No specific configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if you are using any features that require user permissions. However, for basic usage of the **path_icon** package, no additional configuration is necessary.

## Using the Package
To use the **path_icon** package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:path_icon/path_icon.dart';
```

You can then create a custom icon using the `PathIcon` widget. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
PathIcon(
  path: 'M10 20v-6h4v6h5v-8h-5V2h-4v10H5v8h5z', // Example SVG path
  size: 24.0, // Size of the icon
  color: Colors.blue, // Color of the icon
)
```

This will render a custom icon based on the provided SVG path.

# Complete Example of Using Path Icon

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:path_icon/path_icon.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Path Icon Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Path Icon Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Using PathIcon to create a custom icon
              PathIcon(
                path: 'M10 20v-6h4v6h5v-8h-5V2h-4v10H5v8h5z', // SVG path for a custom icon
                size: 100.0, // Setting the size of the icon
                color: Colors.blue, // Setting the color of the icon
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              // Another PathIcon with different properties
              PathIcon(
                path: 'M12 2C10.34 2 9 3.34 9 5s1.34 3 3 3 3-1.34 3-3-1.34-3-3-3zm0 14c-4.41 0-8 2.69-8 6v2h16v-2c0-3.31-3.59-6-8-6z', // Another SVG path
                size: 50.0, // Smaller size for this icon
                color: Colors.red, // Different color for this icon
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Explanation of the application flow:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Path Icon Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Column widget.
// 5. Inside the Column, two PathIcon widgets are created with different SVG paths, sizes, and colors.
// 6. The first PathIcon is larger and blue, while the second is smaller and red, demonstrating customization options.

In summary, the **path_icon** package provides a flexible way to create custom icons in Flutter applications using SVG paths. The example above demonstrates how to set up the package, create icons, and customize their appearance, making it a valuable tool for developers looking to enhance their app's UI with unique vector graphics.
