# Filesystem Picker Flutter Package

The `filesystem_picker` Flutter package is a powerful tool that allows developers to easily integrate file and directory picking capabilities into their Flutter applications. This package is particularly useful for applications that require users to select files from their device's filesystem, such as document management apps, media players, or any app that needs to access local files.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `filesystem_picker` package when:
- You need to allow users to select files or directories from their device.
- Your application requires access to specific file types (e.g., images, documents).
- You want to provide a user-friendly interface for file selection.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Customizable UI**: Allows customization of the file picker interface.
- **File Type Filtering**: Supports filtering by file types, making it easier for users to find the files they need.
- **Directory Selection**: Users can select entire directories, not just individual files.

With these features, the `filesystem_picker` package enhances the user experience by simplifying file selection processes in Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Filesystem Picker

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `filesystem_picker` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  filesystem_picker: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.yourapp">

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
    
    <application
        ...
    </application>
</manifest>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request permission to access files:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to select images.</string>
<key>NSDocumentsFolderUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your documents to select files.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Below is an example of how to implement the file picker.

# Complete Example of Using Filesystem Picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:filesystem_picker/filesystem_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Filesystem Picker Example',
      home: FilePickerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class FilePickerScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  // Function to open the file picker
  Future<void> _pickFile(BuildContext context) async {
    // Open the file picker dialog
    final String? path = await FilesystemPicker.open(
      title: 'Select a file',
      context: context,
      rootDirectory: Directory('/'), // Start from the root directory
      fsType: FilesystemType.file, // Specify that we want to pick files
      fileTileSelectMode: FileTileSelectMode.wholeTile, // Select the whole tile
      allowedExtensions: ['jpg', 'png', 'pdf'], // Filter by file types
      // Optionally, you can set a theme and other parameters
    );

    // Check if a file was selected
    if (path != null) {
      // Show the selected file path
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Selected file: $path')),
      );
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Filesystem Picker Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () => _pickFile(context), // Call the file picker function
          child: Text('Pick a File'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (FilePickerScreen).
// 3. FilePickerScreen contains a button that, when pressed, calls the _pickFile function.
// 4. The _pickFile function opens the filesystem picker dialog, allowing the user to select a file.
// 5. If a file is selected, its path is displayed in a SnackBar at the bottom of the screen.
