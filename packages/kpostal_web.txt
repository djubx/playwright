# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using kpostal_web

## Installation
To get started with the `kpostal_web` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  kpostal_web: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/kpostal_web).

## Platform-Specific Details
### Web Configuration
Since `kpostal_web` is specifically designed for web applications, ensure that your Flutter project is set up for web development. You can create a new Flutter web project using:

```bash
flutter create my_web_app
cd my_web_app
flutter run -d chrome
```

### Additional Configurations
No additional configurations are required for using `kpostal_web` on the web. Just ensure that your Flutter environment is up to date.

## Using the Package
To use the `kpostal_web` package, you will typically import it into your Dart file and create a widget that utilizes its features. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:kpostal_web/kpostal_web.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('KPostal Web Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: KPostalInput(
            onPostalCodeSelected: (postalCode) {
              // Handle the selected postal code
              print('Selected Postal Code: $postalCode');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that uses the `KPostalInput` widget to allow users to select a postal code. The `onPostalCodeSelected` callback is triggered when a postal code is selected, allowing you to handle the selected value accordingly.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the `kpostal_web` package into your Flutter web application seamlessly.

# Complete Example of kpostal_web in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:kpostal_web/kpostal_web.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'KPostal Web Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('KPostal Web Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: KPostalInput(
            onPostalCodeSelected: (postalCode) {
              // This callback is triggered when a postal code is selected
              print('Selected Postal Code: $postalCode');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'KPostal Web Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains the KPostalInput widget.
// 5. When a user selects a postal code from the KPostalInput widget, the onPostalCodeSelected callback is triggered.
// 6. The selected postal code is printed to the console, allowing developers to handle it as needed.
