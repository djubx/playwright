# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Country Picker Plus

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `country_picker_plus` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  country_picker_plus: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/country_picker_plus).

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:country_picker_plus/country_picker_plus.dart';
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` if your app requires location services. However, for the country picker itself, no additional configuration is necessary.

## Step 4: Using the Country Picker

You can now use the country picker in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
// Inside your widget
CountryPicker(
  onSelect: (country) {
    // Handle the selected country
    print('Selected country: ${country.name}');
  },
)
```

This will display a country picker dialog when invoked, allowing users to select their country.

# Complete Example of Country Picker Plus

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:country_picker_plus/country_picker_plus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Country Picker Plus Example',
      home: CountryPickerExample(),
    );
  }
}

class CountryPickerExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CountryPickerExampleState createState() => _CountryPickerExampleState();
}

class _CountryPickerExampleState extends State<CountryPickerExample> {
  String? selectedCountry;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Country Picker Plus Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the selected country or a placeholder
            Text(
              selectedCountry ?? 'Select a country',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Show the country picker dialog
                showCountryPicker(
                  context: context,
                  onSelect: (country) {
                    // Update the selected country state
                    setState(() {
                      selectedCountry = country.name;
                    });
                  },
                );
              },
              child: Text('Pick a Country'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget (CountryPickerExample).
// 3. CountryPickerExample is a stateful widget that maintains the selected country state.
// 4. The build method displays a Text widget showing the selected country or a placeholder.
// 5. An ElevatedButton is provided to trigger the country picker dialog.
// 6. When the button is pressed, the showCountryPicker function is called, displaying the country picker.
// 7. Upon selecting a country, the onSelect callback updates the selectedCountry state, which refreshes the UI to show the selected country name.
