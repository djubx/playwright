  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

```

```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

To use the `show_loader_dialog`, you need to import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:show_loader_dialog/show_loader_dialog.dart';
```

### Displaying the Loader

You can display the loader dialog by calling the `showLoaderDialog` function. Here’s a simple example:

```dart
showLoaderDialog(context);
```

### Dismissing the Loader

To dismiss the loader dialog, you can call the `Navigator.of(context).pop();` method once your task is complete.

### Platform-Specific Details

- **Android**: Ensure that your app has the necessary permissions if you are performing network operations.
- **iOS**: Make sure to handle any specific configurations in your `Info.plist` if you are accessing the internet.

### Example Configuration

Here’s a simple example of how to use the loader dialog in a button click event:

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () {
    showLoaderDialog(context);
    // Simulate a network request
    Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2), () {
      Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Dismiss the loader
    });
  },
  child: Text('Show Loader'),
)
```

This code snippet shows how to display the loader when a button is pressed and dismiss it after a simulated delay.

# Complete Example of show_loader_dialog

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:show_loader_dialog/show_loader_dialog.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Loader Dialog Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Loader Dialog Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Show the loader dialog when the button is pressed
              showLoaderDialog(context);
              
              // Simulate a network request with a delay
              Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2), () {
                // Dismiss the loader dialog after the task is complete
                Navigator.of(context).pop();
              });
            },
            child: Text('Show Loader'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'Loader Dialog Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 5. An ElevatedButton is created, which, when pressed, triggers the showLoaderDialog function.
// 6. The loader dialog is displayed immediately, indicating that a process is ongoing.
// 7. A Future.delayed simulates a network request for 2 seconds.
// 8. After the delay, the loader dialog is dismissed using Navigator.of(context).pop().
// 9. The user sees the loading dialog for 2 seconds before it disappears, providing feedback about the ongoing process.
