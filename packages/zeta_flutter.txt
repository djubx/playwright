# Zeta Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the zeta_flutter package and demonstrate how to use its features effectively.

## Installation

To add the zeta_flutter package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  zeta_flutter: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # Ensure this is set to at least 10.0
```

## Basic Usage

To use the zeta_flutter package, you can import it into your Dart files:

```dart
import 'package:zeta_flutter/zeta_flutter.dart';
```

You can then utilize its features, such as state management and networking, in your application. For example, to create a simple state management solution:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ZetaProvider(
      child: MaterialApp(
        home: HomeScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This sets up a basic application structure using the zeta_flutter package. 

By following these steps, you can effectively integrate the zeta_flutter package into your Flutter projects and leverage its powerful features.

# Complete Example of Zeta Flutter Package

Here is a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the zeta_flutter package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:zeta_flutter/zeta_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Wrapping the app with ZetaProvider for state management
    return ZetaProvider(
      child: MaterialApp(
        title: 'Zeta Flutter Example',
        theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
        home: HomeScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Using ZetaState to manage state
    final state = ZetaState.of(context);

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home Screen')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Current Count: ${state.count}'), // Displaying current count
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Incrementing the count when button is pressed
                state.increment();
              },
              child: Text('Increment Count'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the ZetaProvider, which provides state management capabilities.
// 3. The MaterialApp is created with a title and theme, and the HomeScreen is set as the home widget.
// 4. In HomeScreen, we access the ZetaState to get the current count and display it.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the increment method is called, updating the state and rebuilding the UI.
```
