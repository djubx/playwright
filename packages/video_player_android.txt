# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Video Player Android Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `video_player_android` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  video_player_android: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/video_player_android).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Ensure that your Android app has the necessary permissions to access the internet and read external storage. Add the following lines to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
   ```

2. **Minimum SDK Version**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to ensure that your app has the appropriate permissions to access the internet. Add the following to your `Info.plist` file located in `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the video player.

# Complete Example of Using the Video Player Android Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:video_player/video_player.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late VideoPlayerController _controller; // Controller for managing video playback
  late Future<void> _initializeVideoPlayerFuture; // Future to wait for video initialization

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the video player controller with a video URL
    _controller = VideoPlayerController.network(
      'https://www.example.com/video.mp4', // Replace with your video URL
    );

    // Initialize the controller and store the Future for later use
    _initializeVideoPlayerFuture = _controller.initialize();
    
    // Set up a listener to update the UI when the video is played or paused
    _controller.addListener(() {
      setState(() {}); // Update the UI when the video state changes
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the controller when the widget is removed from the widget tree
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Video Player Example'), // App bar title
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // FutureBuilder to wait for the video to initialize
              FutureBuilder<void>(
                future: _initializeVideoPlayerFuture,
                builder: (context, snapshot) {
                  if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.done) {
                    // If the video is initialized, display the video player
                    return AspectRatio(
                      aspectRatio: _controller.value.aspectRatio,
                      child: VideoPlayer(_controller),
                    );
                  } else {
                    // If the video is still loading, show a loading spinner
                    return CircularProgressIndicator();
                  }
                },
              ),
              // Play/Pause button
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  setState(() {
                    // Toggle play/pause state
                    _controller.value.isPlaying
                        ? _controller.pause() // Pause the video if it's playing
                        : _controller.play(); // Play the video if it's paused
                  });
                },
                child: Icon(
                  _controller.value.isPlaying ? Icons.pause : Icons.play_arrow,
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget, a VideoPlayerController is created to manage video playback.
// 3. The video is initialized in the initState method, and a listener is added to update the UI on state changes.
// 4. The build method uses a FutureBuilder to wait for the video to initialize before displaying it.
// 5. A button is provided to play or pause the video, updating the UI accordingly.
```
