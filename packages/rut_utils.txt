## Setup and Usage Tutorial

### Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the `rut_utils` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and include the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  rut_utils: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

### Step 2: Installing the Package
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
#### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

#### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

### Step 4: Importing the Package
In your Dart files, import the package to start using its features:

```dart
import 'package:rut_utils/rut_utils.dart';
```

### Step 5: Using the Package
You can now utilize the various utilities provided by `rut_utils`. For example, to format a date, you can use:

```dart
String formattedDate = RutUtils.formatDate(DateTime.now());
```

This will give you a string representation of the current date in a predefined format.

### Conclusion
With the `rut_utils` package set up, you can now take advantage of its features to enhance your Flutter applications. The next section will provide a complete example demonstrating the key functionalities of the package.

## Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:rut_utils/rut_utils.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Rut Utils Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Rut Utils Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display the current date formatted using rut_utils
            Text(
              'Formatted Date: ${RutUtils.formatDate(DateTime.now())}',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Example of using a validation utility
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                String input = "example@example.com";
                bool isValidEmail = RutUtils.validateEmail(input);
                // Show a dialog based on the validation result
                showDialog(
                  context: context,
                  builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                    title: Text('Email Validation'),
                    content: Text(isValidEmail
                        ? 'Valid Email!'
                        : 'Invalid Email!'),
                    actions: <Widget>[
                      TextButton(
                        child: Text('OK'),
                        onPressed: () {
                          Navigator.of(context).pop();
                        },
                      ),
                    ],
                  ),
                );
              },
              child: Text('Validate Email'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The HomePage widget is set as the home of the MaterialApp.
// 4. Inside HomePage, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. The Center widget contains a Column that displays the formatted current date using RutUtils.
// 6. An ElevatedButton is provided to validate an email address when pressed.
// 7. Upon pressing the button, the email validation function is called, and a dialog is shown with the validation result.
```
