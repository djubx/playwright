# Overview of the cli_dialog Flutter Package

The `cli_dialog` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to create command-line interface (CLI) style dialogs within their applications. This package is particularly useful for applications that require user input in a structured format, such as terminal-based applications or when building tools that mimic CLI behavior.

## When to Use `cli_dialog`

- **Command-Line Applications**: If you're building a Flutter application that operates in a command-line environment, `cli_dialog` can help you create interactive prompts.
- **User Input**: When you need to gather user input in a structured way, such as asking for confirmation or collecting data.
- **Testing and Debugging**: Useful for creating simple interfaces for testing scripts or debugging purposes.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Prompts**: Create various types of prompts, including text input, confirmation dialogs, and selection menus.
- **Customizable**: Offers options to customize the appearance and behavior of dialogs.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate into existing Flutter applications with minimal setup.

Overall, `cli_dialog` is a versatile package that enhances user interaction in Flutter applications, especially those that require a command-line feel.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using cli_dialog

## Installation

To get started with `cli_dialog`, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  cli_dialog: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Then, run the following command to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage

To use `cli_dialog`, you need to import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:cli_dialog/cli_dialog.dart';
```

You can then create a dialog and display it to the user. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a text input dialog:

```dart
void main() {
  final dialog = CLI_Dialog();
  String? name = dialog.ask('What is your name?');
  print('Hello, $name!');
}
```

This code snippet creates a dialog that prompts the user for their name and then prints a greeting.

## Additional Configuration

You can customize the dialog's appearance and behavior by passing parameters to the `CLI_Dialog` constructor. For example, you can change the prompt message or set a default value.

```dart
final dialog = CLI_Dialog(prompt: 'Please enter your name:');
```

This customization allows you to tailor the user experience to fit your application's needs.

# Complete Example of cli_dialog in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cli_dialog/cli_dialog.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'CLI Dialog Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('CLI Dialog Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Create an instance of CLI_Dialog
              final dialog = CLI_Dialog();

              // Ask for the user's name
              String? name = dialog.ask('What is your name?');

              // Display a greeting message
              dialog.info('Hello, $name!');
            },
            child: Text('Open CLI Dialog'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 4. When the button is pressed, an instance of CLI_Dialog is created.
// 5. The dialog prompts the user for their name using the ask method.
// 6. After the user inputs their name, a greeting message is displayed using the info method.
// 7. This flow allows for interactive user input and feedback within a Flutter application.
