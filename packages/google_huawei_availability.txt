<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Google Huawei Availability Flutter Package

The `google_huawei_availability` Flutter package is designed to help developers determine the availability of Google Play Services and Huawei Mobile Services on a device. This is particularly useful for applications that rely on these services for functionalities such as authentication, analytics, and cloud messaging. 

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using this package in scenarios where your app needs to:

- **Check for Google Play Services**: If your app uses Google APIs, you need to ensure that Google Play Services is available on the device.
- **Check for Huawei Mobile Services**: For apps targeting Huawei devices, it's essential to verify the availability of Huawei Mobile Services, especially in regions where Google services are restricted.
- **Implement Conditional Logic**: Based on the availability of these services, you can implement conditional logic to provide alternative functionalities or inform users about the limitations.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices.
- **Simple API**: Easy-to-use methods to check the availability of Google and Huawei services.
- **Error Handling**: Provides clear error messages for better debugging and user experience.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To use the `google_huawei_availability` package, add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  google_huawei_availability: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions. Add the following lines inside the `<manifest>` tag:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure your `build.gradle` file is set up correctly to support the package.

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Add the following key to your `Info.plist` file to allow network access:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package

You can now use the package in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to check for the availability of Google and Huawei services:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:google_huawei_availability/google_huawei_availability.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Google Huawei Availability')),
        body: Center(
          child: FutureBuilder(
            future: checkServices(),
            builder: (context, snapshot) {
              if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                return CircularProgressIndicator();
              } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
                return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}');
              } else {
                return Text('Services Available: ${snapshot.data}');
              }
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  Future<String> checkServices() async {
    final googleAvailable = await GoogleHuaweiAvailability.isGooglePlayServicesAvailable();
    final huaweiAvailable = await GoogleHuaweiAvailability.isHuaweiMobileServicesAvailable();

    return 'Google Play Services: $googleAvailable, Huawei Mobile Services: $huaweiAvailable';
  }
}
```

This code sets up a simple Flutter application that checks for the availability of Google Play Services and Huawei Mobile Services and displays the results.

# Complete Example: Main File

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:google_huawei_availability/google_huawei_availability.dart';

// Main entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// The main widget of the application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Google Huawei Availability')),
        body: Center(
          // Using FutureBuilder to handle asynchronous service checks
          child: FutureBuilder(
            future: checkServices(),
            builder: (context, snapshot) {
              // While waiting for the future to complete, show a loading indicator
              if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                return CircularProgressIndicator();
              } 
              // If there's an error, display it
              else if (snapshot.hasError) {
                return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}');
              } 
              // If the future completes successfully, display the results
              else {
                return Text('Services Available: ${snapshot.data}');
              }
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to check the availability of Google and Huawei services
  Future<String> checkServices() async {
    // Check if Google Play Services are available
    final googleAvailable = await GoogleHuaweiAvailability.isGooglePlayServicesAvailable();
    // Check if Huawei Mobile Services are available
    final huaweiAvailable = await GoogleHuaweiAvailability.isHuaweiMobileServicesAvailable();

    // Return a string summarizing the availability of both services
    return 'Google Play Services: $googleAvailable, Huawei Mobile Services: $huaweiAvailable';
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, a FutureBuilder is used to asynchronously check the availability of Google and Huawei services.
// 4. While waiting for the results, a CircularProgressIndicator is displayed.
// 5. If an error occurs during the check, it is displayed on the screen.
// 6. Once the checks are complete, the results are displayed in a Text widget, indicating the availability of both services.
```
