# Tutorial: Setting Up Syncfusion Flutter Calendar

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `syncfusion_flutter_calendar` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `syncfusion_flutter_calendar` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  syncfusion_flutter_calendar: ^20.1.55
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the new dependency.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in the `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to enable the use of Swift in your project. Open the `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` file in Xcode, and ensure that the project settings are configured to support Swift.

## Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:syncfusion_flutter_calendar/calendar.dart';
```

## Step 4: Basic Usage

You can now use the `SfCalendar` widget in your application. Here’s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(
      title: Text('Syncfusion Calendar Example'),
    ),
    body: SfCalendar(
      view: CalendarView.month,
      initialSelectedDate: DateTime.now(),
    ),
  );
}
```

This code creates a basic calendar view that displays the current month.

## Step 5: Customization and Event Management

You can customize the calendar and manage events by using the following properties:

- **onTap**: To handle tap events on the calendar.
- **dataSource**: To provide a list of events to the calendar.

Here’s an example of how to implement event management:

```dart
class EventDataSource extends CalendarDataSource {
  EventDataSource(List<Appointment> source) {
    appointments = source;
  }
}
```

This class allows you to create a data source for your events.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the `syncfusion_flutter_calendar` package in your Flutter application effectively.

# Complete Example of Syncfusion Flutter Calendar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:syncfusion_flutter_calendar/calendar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Syncfusion Calendar Example',
      home: CalendarHome(),
    );
  }
}

class CalendarHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CalendarHomeState createState() => _CalendarHomeState();
}

class _CalendarHomeState extends State<CalendarHome> {
  // List to hold appointments
  List<Appointment> _appointments = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize appointments
    _appointments.add(Appointment(
      startTime: DateTime.now(),
      endTime: DateTime.now().add(Duration(hours: 1)),
      subject: 'Meeting',
      color: Colors.blue,
    ));
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Syncfusion Calendar Example'),
      ),
      body: SfCalendar(
        view: CalendarView.month, // Set the calendar view to month
        initialSelectedDate: DateTime.now(), // Set the initial selected date
        dataSource: EventDataSource(_appointments), // Set the data source
        onTap: calendarTapped, // Handle tap events
      ),
    );
  }

  // Method to handle calendar tap events
  void calendarTapped(CalendarTapDetails details) {
    if (details.targetElement == CalendarElement.calendarCell) {
      // If a calendar cell is tapped, add a new appointment
      setState(() {
        _appointments.add(Appointment(
          startTime: details.date!,
          endTime: details.date!.add(Duration(hours: 1)),
          subject: 'New Event',
          color: Colors.green,
        ));
      });
    }
  }
}

// Custom data source class for appointments
class EventDataSource extends CalendarDataSource {
  EventDataSource(List<Appointment> source) {
    appointments = source; // Assign the list of appointments
  }
}

/*
  Application Flow Explanation:
  1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
  2. The RealFlutter widget builds the MaterialApp with a title and home set to CalendarHome.
  3. The CalendarHome widget initializes a list of appointments in its state.
  4. The SfCalendar widget is displayed with a month view and the current date selected.
  5. When a user taps on a calendar cell, the calendarTapped method is triggered.
  6. If a cell is tapped, a new appointment is added to the list, and the calendar is updated.
  7. The EventDataSource class is used to manage the list of appointments and provide them to the calendar.
