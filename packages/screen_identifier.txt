# Overview of the screen_identifier Flutter Package

The `screen_identifier` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that allows for easy identification of the device's screen size and type. This package is particularly useful when building responsive applications that need to adapt their UI based on the device's characteristics. 

## When to Use

You might consider using the `screen_identifier` package in scenarios such as:
- Creating adaptive layouts that change based on screen size (e.g., mobile vs. tablet).
- Implementing features that require specific screen dimensions, such as custom navigation or UI elements.
- Enhancing user experience by tailoring content based on the device type.

## Key Features
- **Screen Size Detection**: Easily retrieve the width and height of the device's screen.
- **Device Type Identification**: Determine whether the device is a mobile phone, tablet, or desktop.
- **Orientation Awareness**: Get the current orientation of the device (portrait or landscape).
- **Responsive Design Support**: Facilitate the creation of responsive UIs that adapt to different screen sizes.

Overall, the `screen_identifier` package simplifies the process of making your Flutter applications responsive and user-friendly.

# Setting Up and Using the screen_identifier Package

## Installation

To get started with the `screen_identifier` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  screen_identifier: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package. After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package

To use the `screen_identifier` package, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:screen_identifier/screen_identifier.dart';
```

You can then access various properties to get information about the screen size, type, and orientation. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use it:

```dart
void main() {
  // Initialize the screen identifier
  ScreenIdentifier.init();

  // Get screen size
  var screenSize = ScreenIdentifier.getScreenSize();
  print('Screen Size: ${screenSize.width} x ${screenSize.height}');

  // Get device type
  var deviceType = ScreenIdentifier.getDeviceType();
  print('Device Type: $deviceType');

  // Get orientation
  var orientation = ScreenIdentifier.getOrientation();
  print('Orientation: $orientation');
}
```

This code initializes the `screen_identifier` package and retrieves the screen size, device type, and orientation, printing them to the console.

# Complete Example of Using screen_identifier

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:screen_identifier/screen_identifier.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Initialize the screen identifier
    ScreenIdentifier.init();

    // Get screen size
    var screenSize = ScreenIdentifier.getScreenSize();
    // Get device type
    var deviceType = ScreenIdentifier.getDeviceType();
    // Get orientation
    var orientation = ScreenIdentifier.getOrientation();

    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Screen Identifier Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Screen Identifier Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text('Screen Size: ${screenSize.width} x ${screenSize.height}'),
              Text('Device Type: $deviceType'),
              Text('Orientation: $orientation'),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. Inside the RealFlutter widget, the screen_identifier package is initialized.
// 3. The screen size, device type, and orientation are retrieved using the package's methods.
// 4. A MaterialApp is created with a simple UI that displays the screen size, device type, and orientation.
// 5. The UI is built using a Center widget containing a Column that aligns its children in the center of the screen.
```

### Summary of the Code Flow
The provided code initializes the `screen_identifier` package and retrieves essential information about the device's screen. It then displays this information in a simple Flutter application. The app's main structure is straightforward, making it easy to understand how to integrate the `screen_identifier` package into your own projects. By following the steps outlined in the tutorial, developers can effectively utilize this package to create responsive and adaptive Flutter applications.
