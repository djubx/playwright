In summary, the code flows as follows:

1.  The `LayerLens` instance is created with a list of layers.
2.  Each layer is created with a widget and an optional input handler.
3.  The input handler is used to handle input events, such as pointer down and pointer move events.
4.  When an input event is detected, the corresponding input handler is called.
5.  The input handler can then perform any necessary actions.

This example demonstrates the basic usage of the Layerlens package, including creating layers, handling input events, and customizing layer behavior.
