# Exploring the LayerLens Flutter Package

The **LayerLens** package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who want to create layered visual effects in their applications. It allows developers to easily manage and manipulate layers of widgets, providing a unique way to enhance the user interface with depth and interactivity. 

## When to Use LayerLens
LayerLens is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to create complex visual hierarchies, such as:
- **Games**: For creating layered backgrounds and foregrounds.
- **Animations**: To manage multiple animated layers that interact with each other.
- **Custom UI Designs**: When building unique layouts that require overlapping widgets.

## Key Features
- **Layer Management**: Easily add, remove, and manipulate layers of widgets.
- **Interactive Layers**: Support for touch events on individual layers.
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient rendering of layers to ensure smooth performance.
- **Customizable**: Extensive options for customizing the appearance and behavior of layers.

With these features, LayerLens empowers developers to create visually stunning applications with ease.

# Setting Up and Using LayerLens

## Installation
To get started with LayerLens, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  layerlens: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/layerlens).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable certain capabilities in your `Info.plist` file, depending on the features you plan to use. For example, if you are using any specific permissions, make sure to declare them.

## Basic Usage
To use LayerLens in your application, you can start by creating a simple widget that utilizes the LayerLens functionality. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:layerlens/layerlens.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return LayerLens(
      layers: [
        // Add your layers here
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

This sets up a basic LayerLens widget where you can add your layers. You can customize each layer with different widgets and properties.

# Complete Example of LayerLens in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:layerlens/layerlens.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'LayerLens Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('LayerLens Demo'),
      ),
      body: LayerLens(
        layers: [
          // First layer: Background
          Container(
            color: Colors.blue,
            child: Center(child: Text('Background Layer', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24))),
          ),
          // Second layer: Middle
          Container(
            color: Colors.green.withOpacity(0.7),
            child: Center(child: Text('Middle Layer', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24))),
          ),
          // Third layer: Foreground
          GestureDetector(
            onTap: () {
              // Action when the foreground layer is tapped
              print('Foreground Layer Tapped!');
            },
            child: Container(
              color: Colors.red.withOpacity(0.5),
              child: Center(child: Text('Foreground Layer', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24))),
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets up the MaterialApp widget.
// 2. The MyApp widget builds the home screen using the RealFlutter widget.
// 3. In the RealFlutter widget, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a LayerLens widget.
// 4. The LayerLens widget contains three layers: a blue background, a green middle layer, and a red foreground layer.
// 5. The foreground layer is interactive; tapping it triggers a print statement to the console.
// 6. Each layer can be customized further with additional widgets and properties as needed.
```
