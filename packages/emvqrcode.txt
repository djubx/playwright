# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using EMVQRCode

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **emvqrcode** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **emvqrcode** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  emvqrcode: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it to generate EMV QR codes. Below is a simple example of how to create a QR code in your Flutter application.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:emvqrcode/emvqrcode.dart';
```

2. Create a function to generate the QR code:

```dart
String generateQRCode(String merchantId, double amount) {
  final qrData = EMVQRCode(
    merchantId: merchantId,
    amount: amount,
    currency: 'USD',
  );
  return qrData.toString();
}
```

3. Use the generated QR code in your widget tree, for example, in an `Image` widget.

With these steps, you can successfully integrate the **emvqrcode** package into your Flutter application and start generating EMV QR codes for payments.

# Complete Example of EMVQRCode in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:emvqrcode/emvqrcode.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'EMV QR Code Example',
      home: QRCodePage(),
    );
  }
}

class QRCodePage extends StatelessWidget {
  // Function to generate QR code data
  String generateQRCode(String merchantId, double amount) {
    // Create an instance of EMVQRCode with required parameters
    final qrData = EMVQRCode(
      merchantId: merchantId,
      amount: amount,
      currency: 'USD',
    );
    // Return the QR code string representation
    return qrData.toString();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Example merchant ID and amount
    String merchantId = '123456789';
    double amount = 10.00;

    // Generate the QR code string
    String qrCodeData = generateQRCode(merchantId, amount);

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('EMV QR Code Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        // Display the QR code as an image
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Scan this QR Code for payment:'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Use the generated QR code data to create an image
            Image.network('https://api.qrserver.com/v1/create-qr-code/?data=$qrCodeData&size=200x200'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. QRCodePage is the main page where the QR code is generated and displayed.
// 4. The generateQRCode function creates an EMVQRCode instance with the merchant ID and amount.
// 5. The QR code data is generated and used to create a QR code image using an external API.
// 6. The QR code is displayed in the center of the screen for users to scan.
```
