# Setting Up the Animated Menu Package
--------------------------------------

To use the `animated_menu` package in your Flutter project, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your `pubspec.yaml` File

```yml
dependencies:
  animated_menu: ^1.0.0
```

### Step 2: Import the Package in Your Dart File

```dart
import 'package:animated_menu/animated_menu.dart';
```

### Step 3: Create an `AnimatedMenu` Widget

```dart
AnimatedMenu(
  items: [
    AnimatedMenuItem(
      icon: Icons.home,
      label: 'Home',
    ),
    AnimatedMenuItem(
      icon: Icons.settings,
      label: 'Settings',
    ),
  ],
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details

* For Android, you may need to adjust the `android:windowSoftInputMode` property in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file to ensure proper keyboard handling.
* For iOS, you may need to add a ` NSAppTransportSecurity` key to your `Info.plist` file to enable HTTP requests.

### Configurations and Optimizations

* You can customize the animation duration, curve, and other properties using the `AnimatedMenu` widget's properties.
* To improve performance, consider using a `RepaintBoundary` widget to limit the repaint area.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_menu/animated_menu.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  int _currentIndex = 0;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animated Menu Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Hello, World!'),
        ),
        bottomNavigationBar: AnimatedMenu(
          items: [
            AnimatedMenuItem(
              icon: Icons.home,
              label: 'Home',
            ),
            AnimatedMenuItem(
              icon: Icons.settings,
              label: 'Settings',
            ),
          ],
          currentIndex: _currentIndex,
          onTap: (index) {
            setState(() {
              _currentIndex = index;
            });
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application flow:
// 1. The user launches the app, and the `RealFlutter` widget is created.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` widget builds the app's UI, including the `AnimatedMenu` widget.
// 3. The `AnimatedMenu` widget displays the menu items with animated transitions.
// 4. When the user taps a menu item, the `onTap` callback is called, updating the `_currentIndex` variable.
// 5. The `setState` method is called, triggering a rebuild of the UI with the new `_currentIndex` value.
// 6. The `AnimatedMenu` widget updates its UI to reflect the new `_currentIndex` value, animating the transition between menu items.

// Final summary:
// The `animated_menu` package provides an easy-to-use interface for creating stunning menus in Flutter applications.
// This example demonstrates how to use the package to create a bottom navigation bar with animated icons.
// The app's UI is built using the `RealFlutter` widget, which includes the `AnimatedMenu` widget.
// The `AnimatedMenu` widget displays the menu items with animated transitions and updates its UI when the user taps a menu item.
