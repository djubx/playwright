# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `dart_console`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `dart_console` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  dart_console: ^0.10.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to adjust your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that you have the package installed, you can start using it in your Dart files. Here’s a simple example of how to create a console application using `dart_console`.

```dart
import 'package:dart_console/dart_console.dart';

void main() {
  final console = Console();
  console.writeLine('Welcome to the Dart Console Application!');
  console.writeLine('Press any key to continue...');
  console.readKey();
}
```

In this example, we import the `dart_console` package, create a `Console` object, and use it to write text to the console and read a key press from the user.

## Step 4: Advanced Features

You can also use advanced features like colored text and cursor manipulation. Here’s how you can implement these features:

```dart
import 'package:dart_console/dart_console.dart';

void main() {
  final console = Console();
  
  // Set the text color to green
  console.setForegroundColor(ConsoleColor.green);
  console.writeLine('This text is green!');
  
  // Reset to default color
  console.setForegroundColor(ConsoleColor.white);
  console.writeLine('Press any key to exit...');
  console.readKey();
}
```

This code demonstrates how to change the text color and reset it back to the default.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and start using the `dart_console` package in your Flutter applications effectively.

# Complete Example of a Dart Console Application

```dart
import 'package:dart_console/dart_console.dart';

void main() {
  // Create a console object to interact with the terminal
  final console = Console();

  // Clear the console for a fresh start
  console.clearScreen();

  // Set the title of the console window
  console.setTitle('Dart Console Example');

  // Display a welcome message
  console.writeLine('Welcome to the Dart Console Application!');

  // Set the text color to blue for the next message
  console.setForegroundColor(ConsoleColor.blue);
  console.writeLine('This is a simple console application.');

  // Reset the text color to default
  console.setForegroundColor(ConsoleColor.white);

  // Prompt the user for their name
  console.write('Please enter your name: ');

  // Read user input
  String? name = console.readLine();

  // Greet the user
  console.writeLine('Hello, $name!');

  // Wait for the user to press a key before exiting
  console.writeLine('Press any key to exit...');
  console.readKey();
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts by creating a Console object to interact with the terminal.
// 2. It clears the screen and sets the title of the console window.
// 3. A welcome message is displayed in the default color.
// 4. The text color is changed to blue for the next message.
// 5. The user is prompted to enter their name, and the input is read.
// 6. The application greets the user by name.
// 7. Finally, it waits for the user to press any key before exiting.
```
