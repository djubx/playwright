# Overview of the "marked" Flutter Package

The **marked** package is a powerful tool for rendering Markdown content in Flutter applications. It allows developers to easily convert Markdown text into rich, styled widgets, making it an excellent choice for applications that require formatted text, such as blogs, documentation, or any content-heavy app.

## When to Use "marked"

- **Content Management Systems**: If your app pulls content from a CMS that supports Markdown, using the marked package can simplify rendering that content.
- **Documentation Apps**: For apps that display user guides or documentation, Markdown provides a clean way to format text.
- **Blogging Platforms**: If you're building a blogging platform, Markdown is a popular choice for writing posts.

## Key Features

- **Markdown Rendering**: Converts Markdown text into Flutter widgets.
- **Customizable Styles**: Allows customization of text styles for different Markdown elements (headings, lists, links, etc.).
- **Support for Images**: Easily render images from Markdown.
- **Extensible**: You can extend the functionality to support additional Markdown features or custom widgets.

Overall, the marked package is a versatile solution for any Flutter developer looking to incorporate Markdown into their applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the "marked" Package

## Installation

To use the marked package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  marked: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage

To use the marked package, you can create a simple Flutter widget that takes a Markdown string and renders it. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:marked/marked.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample Markdown text
    String markdownData = """
    # Hello World
    This is a simple Markdown example.
    
    - Item 1
    - Item 2
    - Item 3
    """;

    // Using the Marked widget to render Markdown
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Markdown Example')),
      body: Marked(
        data: markdownData,
        styleSheet: MarkdownStyleSheet(
          h1: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
          p: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application that renders Markdown content using the marked package. You can customize the styles as needed.

# Complete Example of Using the "marked" Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:marked/marked.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Markdown Example',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample Markdown text
    String markdownData = """
    # Welcome to Markdown
    This is a simple Markdown example to demonstrate the marked package.
    
    ## Features

    """;

    // Using the Marked widget to render Markdown
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Markdown Example')),
      body: Marked(
        data: markdownData,
        styleSheet: MarkdownStyleSheet(
          h1: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
          h2: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, fontWeight: FontWeight.w600),
          p: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
          listBullet: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
          a: TextStyle(color: Colors.blue, decoration: TextDecoration.underline),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme, and specifies RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. In RealFlutter, we define a string containing Markdown data, which includes headings, lists, an image, and a link.
// 4. The Scaffold widget provides a basic structure with an AppBar and a body.
// 5. The Marked widget takes the Markdown data and a style sheet to render the content with specified styles.
// 6. The app displays the formatted Markdown content on the screen, allowing users to see the rich text representation.
