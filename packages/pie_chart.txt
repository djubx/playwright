Here's a detailed technical blog on the "pie_chart" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Description

The `pie_chart` Flutter package is a powerful tool for creating pie charts in Flutter applications. It allows developers to visualize data in a circular format, making it easier to understand proportions and relationships between different data points. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to represent statistical data, such as survey results, sales data, or any other categorical data.

## When to Use

You should consider using the `pie_chart` package when:
- You need to display data in a visually appealing way.
- You want to represent parts of a whole, such as percentages or ratios.
- You are developing dashboards or reports that require data visualization.

## Features
- **Customizable Appearance**: You can customize colors, labels, and other visual aspects of the pie chart.
- **Interactive**: The package supports touch interactions, allowing users to tap on segments for more information.
- **Animation**: It includes built-in animations for a smoother user experience.
- **Responsive**: The charts are responsive and can adapt to different screen sizes.

Overall, the `pie_chart` package is an excellent choice for Flutter developers looking to add data visualization capabilities to their applications.

## Setup Process

To use the `pie_chart` package in your Flutter application, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `pie_chart` package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     pie_chart: ^5.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

     ```groovy
     android {
         ...
         defaultConfig {
             ...
             minSdkVersion 21
         }
     }
     ```

   - **iOS**: Open `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode and ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0.

4. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the package:

   ```dart
   import 'package:pie_chart/pie_chart.dart';
   ```

## Using the Package

To create a simple pie chart, you can use the following code snippet:

```dart
PieChart(
  dataMap: {
    "Flutter": 5,
    "React": 3,
    "Xamarin": 2,
  },
  chartType: ChartType.disc,
  colorList: [Colors.blue, Colors.red, Colors.green],
  animationDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 800),
  chartLegendSpacing: 32,
  initialAngleInDegree: 0,
  chartRadius: MediaQuery.of(context).size.width / 3,
  legendOptions: LegendOptions(
    showLegendsInRow: false,
    legendPosition: LegendPosition.right,
    showLegends: true,
  ),
);
```

This code creates a pie chart with three segments representing different frameworks. You can customize the `dataMap`, `colorList`, and other properties to fit your needs.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pie_chart/pie_chart.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Pie Chart Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Pie Chart Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: PieChart(
            dataMap: {
              "Flutter": 5,
              "React": 3,
              "Xamarin": 2,
            },
            chartType: ChartType.disc,
            colorList: [Colors.blue, Colors.red, Colors.green],
            animationDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 800),
            chartLegendSpacing: 32,
            initialAngleInDegree: 0,
            chartRadius: MediaQuery.of(context).size.width / 3,
            legendOptions: LegendOptions(
              showLegendsInRow: false,
              legendPosition: LegendPosition.right,
              showLegends: true,
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The above code defines a Flutter application that displays a pie chart.
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the main UI.
// 3. The MaterialApp widget sets up the app's title and home screen.
// 4. The Scaffold widget provides a structure for the app, including an AppBar and a body.
// 5. The PieChart widget is used to create the pie chart, with data provided in the dataMap.
// 6. The chart is customizable with properties like chartType, colorList, and animationDuration.
// 7. The chart's radius is set to a third of the screen width, ensuring it is responsive.
// 8. Legend options are configured to display the legend on the right side of the chart.
