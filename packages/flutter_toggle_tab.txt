# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_toggle_tab

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_toggle_tab` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_toggle_tab` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_toggle_tab: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the toggle tabs, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_toggle_tab/flutter_toggle_tab.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Toggle Tab Widget

You can now use the `ToggleTab` widget in your application. Below is a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
ToggleTab(
  labels: ['Tab 1', 'Tab 2'],
  selectedLabelIndex: 0,
  onToggle: (index) {
    // Handle the toggle action
  },
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details

- **Android**: Ensure that your Android project is set up with the latest Flutter SDK. The package should work out of the box without any additional configuration.
- **iOS**: For iOS, make sure you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your app requires any specific capabilities.

### Optimizations

- **Performance**: If you have a large number of tabs, consider lazy loading the content associated with each tab to improve performance.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure that your toggle tabs are accessible by providing appropriate labels and hints for screen readers.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the `flutter_toggle_tab` package into your Flutter application seamlessly.

# Complete Example of flutter_toggle_tab

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_toggle_tab/flutter_toggle_tab.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Toggle Tab Example',
      home: ToggleTabExample(),
    );
  }
}

class ToggleTabExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ToggleTabExampleState createState() => _ToggleTabExampleState();
}

class _ToggleTabExampleState extends State<ToggleTabExample> {
  // Variable to keep track of the selected tab index
  int _selectedIndex = 0;

  // Method to handle tab toggle
  void _onToggle(int index) {
    setState(() {
      _selectedIndex = index; // Update the selected index
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Toggle Tab Example'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // ToggleTab widget to switch between tabs
          ToggleTab(
            labels: ['Tab 1', 'Tab 2'], // Labels for the tabs
            selectedLabelIndex: _selectedIndex, // Current selected index
            onToggle: _onToggle, // Callback for toggle action
          ),
          // Display content based on selected tab
          Expanded(
            child: _selectedIndex == 0 ? _buildTab1Content() : _buildTab2Content(),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }

  // Method to build content for Tab 1
  Widget _buildTab1Content() {
    return Center(
      child: Text('Content for Tab 1'), // Placeholder for Tab 1 content
    );
  }

  // Method to build content for Tab 2
  Widget _buildTab2Content() {
    return Center(
      child: Text('Content for Tab 2'), // Placeholder for Tab 2 content
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and home set to ToggleTabExample.
// 3. ToggleTabExample is a stateful widget that maintains the selected tab index.
// 4. The ToggleTab widget displays two tabs and calls _onToggle when a tab is selected.
// 5. Based on the selected index, either _buildTab1Content or _buildTab2Content is called to display the appropriate content.
// 6. The content for each tab is displayed in the center of the screen.
```
