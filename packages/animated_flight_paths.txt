# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Animated Flight Paths Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `animated_flight_paths` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  animated_flight_paths: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add permissions for location services in your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show flight paths.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `animated_flight_paths` package.

<!-- END_TUTORIAL -->

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_flight_paths/animated_flight_paths.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animated Flight Paths Demo',
      home: FlightPathScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class FlightPathScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flight Path Animation'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: AnimatedFlightPath(
          // Define the start and end points of the flight path
          startPoint: LatLng(37.7749, -122.4194), // San Francisco
          endPoint: LatLng(34.0522, -118.2437),   // Los Angeles
          // Customize the appearance of the flight path
          pathColor: Colors.blue,
          pathWidth: 5.0,
          // Set the duration of the animation
          duration: Duration(seconds: 5),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. FlightPathScreen is a StatelessWidget that creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, the AnimatedFlightPath widget is used to display the flight path animation.
// 5. The startPoint and endPoint are defined using LatLng coordinates for San Francisco and Los Angeles.
// 6. The pathColor and pathWidth properties customize the appearance of the flight path.
// 7. The duration property sets how long the animation will take to complete.
```
