# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Better Open File

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **better_open_file** package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **better_open_file** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  better_open_file: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Ensure you have the following permissions added:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to request permission to access files:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to open files.</string>
<key>NSDocumentsFolderUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your documents to open files.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to open a file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:better_open_file/better_open_file.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Better Open File Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Specify the file path
              String filePath = '/path/to/your/file.pdf';
              
              // Open the file using the better_open_file package
              final result = await BetterOpenFile.open(filePath);
              
              // Check the result of the file opening
              if (result != BetterOpenFileStatus.success) {
                // Handle the error
                print('Error opening file: ${result.toString()}');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Open File'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with a button that opens a specified file when pressed. The `BetterOpenFile.open()` method is called with the file path, and we handle the result accordingly.

# Complete Example of Better Open File

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:better_open_file/better_open_file.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Better Open File Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Specify the file path
              String filePath = '/path/to/your/file.pdf'; // Change this to your file path
              
              // Open the file using the better_open_file package
              final result = await BetterOpenFile.open(filePath);
              
              // Check the result of the file opening
              if (result != BetterOpenFileStatus.success) {
                // Handle the error
                print('Error opening file: ${result.toString()}');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Open File'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The MaterialApp widget is created, providing the app structure.
// 3. A Scaffold widget is used to create the basic visual layout with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the onPressed callback is triggered.
// 6. The file path is specified, pointing to the file you want to open.
// 7. The BetterOpenFile.open() method is called with the file path.
// 8. The result of the file opening is checked; if it is not successful, an error message is printed to the console.
