# Tutorial: Setting Up Boleto Utils in Your Flutter Project

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **boleto_utils** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **boleto_utils** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  boleto_utils: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you plan to access the internet or use any specific features. Here’s an example of adding permissions:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using Boleto Utils

Now that we have set up the package, let’s see how to use it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to generate a boleto.

# Complete Example: Boleto Utils in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:boleto_utils/boleto_utils.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Boleto Utils Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: BoletoHome(),
    );
  }
}

class BoletoHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _BoletoHomeState createState() => _BoletoHomeState();
}

class _BoletoHomeState extends State<BoletoHome> {
  // Create a Boleto object
  Boleto boleto;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the boleto with required data
    boleto = Boleto(
      nossoNumero: '1234567890',
      cedente: 'My Company',
      valor: 150.00,
      dataVencimento: DateTime.now().add(Duration(days: 7)),
      // Add other required fields as necessary
    );
  }

  void generateBoleto() {
    // Generate the boleto PDF
    final pdf = boleto.generatePDF();
    // You can save or display the PDF as needed
    // For demonstration, we will just show a snackbar
    ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
      SnackBar(content: Text('Boleto generated!')),
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Boleto Utils Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: generateBoleto,
          child: Text('Generate Boleto'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home as BoletoHome.
// 3. In BoletoHome, we initialize a Boleto object with necessary details in initState.
// 4. When the user presses the "Generate Boleto" button, the generateBoleto method is called.
// 5. This method generates a PDF of the boleto and shows a snackbar notification.
// 6. The user can then take further actions with the generated PDF, such as saving or sharing it.
```
