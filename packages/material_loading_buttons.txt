Here's a detailed technical blog on the "material_loading_buttons" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Material Loading Buttons Flutter Package

The `material_loading_buttons` package is a Flutter library designed to enhance the user experience by providing customizable loading buttons. These buttons can display various loading states, making them ideal for scenarios where a user action triggers a process that takes time, such as submitting a form or loading data.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `material_loading_buttons` package in the following scenarios:

- **Form Submissions**: When users submit forms, you can show a loading button to indicate that the submission is in progress.
- **Data Fetching**: If your app fetches data from an API, using a loading button can inform users that the data is being loaded.
- **User Feedback**: Any action that requires a delay can benefit from a loading button to provide feedback to the user.

## Features

- **Customizable Styles**: You can easily customize the appearance of the buttons to match your app's theme.
- **Multiple States**: The package supports different states, such as idle, loading, and success, allowing for a dynamic user interface.
- **Easy Integration**: The package is straightforward to integrate into existing Flutter applications.

Overall, the `material_loading_buttons` package is a valuable tool for improving user interaction in Flutter applications by providing clear visual feedback during loading processes.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Material Loading Buttons

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `material_loading_buttons` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  material_loading_buttons: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a loading button.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:material_loading_buttons/material_loading_buttons.dart';
```

2. Create a button in your widget tree:

```dart
MaterialLoadingButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // Your action here
  },
  child: Text('Submit'),
);
```

3. Handle the loading state:

You can manage the loading state by using a `StatefulWidget` and updating the button's state based on your logic.

```dart
bool _isLoading = false;

MaterialLoadingButton(
  onPressed: () {
    setState(() {
      _isLoading = true; // Start loading
    });
    // Simulate a network request
    Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2), () {
      setState(() {
        _isLoading = false; // Stop loading
      });
    });
  },
  child: _isLoading ? CircularProgressIndicator() : Text('Submit'),
);
```

This setup allows you to provide visual feedback to users while an action is being processed.

# Complete Example of Material Loading Buttons

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:material_loading_buttons/material_loading_buttons.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Material Loading Buttons Example',
      home: LoadingButtonDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class LoadingButtonDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _LoadingButtonDemoState createState() => _LoadingButtonDemoState();
}

class _LoadingButtonDemoState extends State<LoadingButtonDemo> {
  // State variable to track loading status
  bool _isLoading = false;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Loading Button Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: MaterialLoadingButton(
          // When the button is pressed
          onPressed: () {
            setState(() {
              _isLoading = true; // Set loading state to true
            });
            // Simulate a network request
            Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2), () {
              setState(() {
                _isLoading = false; // Set loading state to false after delay
              });
              // Show a success message after loading
              ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                SnackBar(content: Text('Action completed!')),
              );
            });
          },
          // Display a loading indicator or button text based on loading state
          child: _isLoading
              ? CircularProgressIndicator() // Show loading indicator
              : Text('Submit'), // Show button text
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget (LoadingButtonDemo).
// 3. LoadingButtonDemo is a StatefulWidget that manages its loading state.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the loading state is set to true, and a simulated delay (2 seconds) is initiated.
// 5. During the delay, a CircularProgressIndicator is displayed on the button.
// 6. After the delay, the loading state is set to false, and a SnackBar message is shown to indicate completion.
```
