# EventSubscriber Flutter Package

The `eventsubscriber` package is a powerful tool for managing event-driven architectures in Flutter applications. It allows developers to create a publish-subscribe model, enabling different parts of an application to communicate with each other without tight coupling. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to decouple components, such as in large applications or when implementing features like notifications, state changes, or user interactions.

## When to Use

- **Decoupled Communication**: When you need different parts of your application to communicate without being directly linked.
- **Event Handling**: For applications that require handling various events, such as user actions or system notifications.
- **State Management**: To manage state changes across different widgets or services in a clean and efficient manner.

## Features

- **Simple API**: Easy to use and integrate into existing Flutter applications.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead, making it suitable for performance-sensitive applications.
- **Flexible**: Supports multiple event types and allows for easy subscription and unsubscription.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using EventSubscriber

## Installation

To add the `eventsubscriber` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  eventsubscriber: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/eventsubscriber).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

No specific configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage

1. **Import the Package**: Start by importing the package in your Dart file.

   ```dart
   import 'package:eventsubscriber/eventsubscriber.dart';
   ```

2. **Create an Event Class**: Define the events you want to handle.

   ```dart
   class MyEvent {
     final String message;
     MyEvent(this.message);
   }
   ```

3. **Subscribe to Events**: Use the `EventSubscriber` to listen for events.

   ```dart
   EventSubscriber<MyEvent>().subscribe((event) {
     print('Received event: ${event.message}');
   });
   ```

4. **Publish Events**: Trigger events from anywhere in your application.

   ```dart
   EventSubscriber<MyEvent>().publish(MyEvent('Hello, World!'));
   ```

This setup allows you to publish and subscribe to events easily, facilitating communication across your application.

# Complete Example of EventSubscriber in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:eventsubscriber/eventsubscriber.dart';

// Define an event class to hold the event data
class MyEvent {
  final String message;
  MyEvent(this.message);
}

// Main application class
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'EventSubscriber Example',
      home: EventHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class EventHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _EventHomePageState createState() => _EventHomePageState();
}

class _EventHomePageState extends State<EventHomePage> {
  String _eventMessage = 'No events received yet';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Subscribe to MyEvent
    EventSubscriber<MyEvent>().subscribe((event) {
      // Update the state when an event is received
      setState(() {
        _eventMessage = event.message;
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Unsubscribe from events when the widget is disposed
    EventSubscriber<MyEvent>().unsubscribe();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('EventSubscriber Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(_eventMessage), // Display the received event message
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Publish a new event when the button is pressed
                EventSubscriber<MyEvent>().publish(MyEvent('Hello from the button!'));
              },
              child: Text('Send Event'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds the MaterialApp and sets EventHomePage as the home widget.
// 3. In EventHomePage, we subscribe to MyEvent in initState, updating the state when an event is received.
// 4. When the button is pressed, a new MyEvent is published, triggering the subscription callback.
// 5. The received message updates the UI, displaying the new event message.
// 6. On widget disposal, we unsubscribe from events to prevent memory leaks.
