# Overview of the `reactive_forms_annotations` Flutter Package

The `reactive_forms_annotations` package is a powerful tool for managing forms in Flutter applications using a reactive programming approach. It simplifies the process of creating and validating forms by leveraging annotations, which can significantly reduce boilerplate code and enhance readability.

## When to Use This Package

This package is particularly useful in scenarios where:
- You need to create complex forms with multiple fields and validations.
- You want to maintain a clean separation between UI and business logic.
- You prefer a reactive programming model that allows for real-time updates and validation feedback.

## Key Features
- **Annotations for Form Fields**: Use annotations to define form fields and their validations directly in your model classes.
- **Reactive Programming**: Automatically updates the UI in response to changes in form state.
- **Validation**: Built-in support for various validation rules, making it easy to enforce business logic.
- **Integration with Flutter**: Seamlessly integrates with Flutter's widget tree, allowing for easy form management.

By using `reactive_forms_annotations`, developers can create robust forms with less code and improved maintainability.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `reactive_forms_annotations`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `reactive_forms_annotations` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  reactive_forms_annotations: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/reactive_forms_annotations).

## Step 2: Configuring Your Project

### For Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### For iOS
1. Open `ios/Podfile`.
2. Uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Creating Your Form Model

Create a Dart file for your form model. For example, `user_form.dart`:

```dart
import 'package:reactive_forms_annotations/reactive_forms_annotations.dart';

part 'user_form.g.dart';

@ReactiveForm()
class UserForm {
  @FormControl(validators: [Validators.required])
  String name;

  @FormControl(validators: [Validators.email])
  String email;

  UserForm({this.name, this.email});
}
```

## Step 4: Using the Form in Your Widget

In your Flutter widget, you can now use the `UserForm` model to create a reactive form:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:reactive_forms/reactive_forms.dart';
import 'user_form.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final form = UserForm();

    return ReactiveForm(
      formGroup: form.toFormGroup(),
      child: Column(
        children: [
          ReactiveTextField<String>(
            formControlName: 'name',
            decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Name'),
          ),
          ReactiveTextField<String>(
            formControlName: 'email',
            decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Email'),
          ),
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              if (form.valid) {
                // Handle form submission
              }
            },
            child: Text('Submit'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Running Your Application

After setting up your form and widget, run your application using:

```bash
flutter run
```

This will launch your Flutter app with the reactive form integrated.

# Complete Example of `reactive_forms_annotations`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:reactive_forms/reactive_forms.dart';
import 'user_form.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Reactive Forms Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Reactive Forms with Annotations'),
        ),
        body: RealFlutter(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create an instance of the UserForm model
    final form = UserForm();

    return ReactiveForm(
      // Convert the UserForm model to a FormGroup
      formGroup: form.toFormGroup(),
      child: Column(
        children: [
          // Reactive text field for name input
          ReactiveTextField<String>(
            formControlName: 'name',
            decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Name'),
            // Display validation error if any
            validationMessages: (control) => {
              ValidationMessage.required: 'Name is required',
            },
          ),
          // Reactive text field for email input
          ReactiveTextField<String>(
            formControlName: 'email',
            decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Email'),
            // Display validation error if any
            validationMessages: (control) => {
              ValidationMessage.email: 'Must be a valid email',
            },
          ),
          // Submit button
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Check if the form is valid before submission
              if (form.valid) {
                // Handle form submission logic here
                print('Form submitted: ${form.value}');
              } else {
                // Show validation errors
                print('Form is invalid');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Submit'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app.
// 2. MyApp widget sets up the MaterialApp and the main screen.
// 3. RealFlutter widget creates a reactive form using the UserForm model.
// 4. ReactiveTextField widgets are used for user input, with validation messages displayed.
// 5. On pressing the Submit button, the form is validated.
// 6. If valid, the form data is printed; otherwise, validation errors are shown.
