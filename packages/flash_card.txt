# Tutorial: Setting Up the Flash Card Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the **flash_card** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flash_card: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install the Package
Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Import the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flash_card/flash_card.dart';
```

## Step 5: Basic Usage
You can now start using the **flash_card** package in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to create a flashcard widget.

```dart
FlashCard(
  front: Text('What is Flutter?'),
  back: Text('Flutter is an open-source UI software development toolkit created by Google.'),
);
```

This will create a basic flashcard with a question on the front and the answer on the back.

## Conclusion
You are now ready to implement the **flash_card** package in your Flutter application. The next section will provide a complete example demonstrating all key features of the package.

# Complete Example of Flash Card Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flash_card/flash_card.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flash Card Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: FlashCardHome(),
    );
  }
}

class FlashCardHome extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flash Card App'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: FlashCard(
          front: Text(
            'What is Flutter?',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
          ),
          back: Text(
            'Flutter is an open-source UI toolkit created by Google.',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
          ),
          onFlip: () {
            // This function is called when the card is flipped
            print('Card Flipped!');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to FlashCardHome, which is the main screen of the app.
// 4. FlashCardHome builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a centered FlashCard widget.
// 5. The FlashCard widget displays a question on the front and an answer on the back.
// 6. When the card is flipped, the onFlip callback is triggered, printing a message to the console.
```
