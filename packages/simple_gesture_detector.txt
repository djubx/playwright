<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Simple Gesture Detector Flutter Package

The **simple_gesture_detector** package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to implement gesture detection in their applications. This package simplifies the process of recognizing various gestures, such as taps, swipes, and long presses, allowing developers to create more interactive and user-friendly applications.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the **simple_gesture_detector** package in scenarios where:

- You need to implement custom gesture recognition beyond the default capabilities of Flutter.
- You want to enhance user interaction with your app through gestures.
- You are developing applications that require complex gesture handling, such as games or drawing apps.

## Features

- **Multi-Gesture Recognition**: Detects multiple gestures simultaneously, such as pinch and swipe.
- **Customizable Gesture Callbacks**: Allows developers to define specific actions for different gestures.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that integrates seamlessly with existing Flutter widgets.
- **Platform Compatibility**: Works on both Android and iOS, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.

With these features, the **simple_gesture_detector** package provides a robust solution for implementing gesture detection in Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Simple Gesture Detector

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **simple_gesture_detector** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **simple_gesture_detector** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  simple_gesture_detector: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable gesture recognition in your `Info.plist` file. Add the following key-value pair:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>audio</string>
    <string>location</string>
    <string>fetch</string>
    <string>remote-notification</string>
</array>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's implement it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to use the **simple_gesture_detector** package to recognize gestures.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simple_gesture_detector/simple_gesture_detector.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Simple Gesture Detector Demo',
      home: GestureDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class GestureDemo extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Gesture Detector Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        // Wrapping the GestureDetector with SimpleGestureDetector
        child: SimpleGestureDetector(
          onSwipe: (direction) {
            // Handle swipe gestures
            if (direction == SwipeDirection.left) {
              print('Swiped Left');
            } else if (direction == SwipeDirection.right) {
              print('Swiped Right');
            } else if (direction == SwipeDirection.up) {
              print('Swiped Up');
            } else if (direction == SwipeDirection.down) {
              print('Swiped Down');
            }
          },
          onTap: () {
            // Handle tap gestures
            print('Tapped!');
          },
          onLongPress: () {
            // Handle long press gestures
            print('Long Pressed!');
          },
          // The child widget that will respond to gestures
          child: Container(
            width: 200,
            height: 200,
            color: Colors.blue,
            child: Center(
              child: Text(
                'Gesture Here',
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget (GestureDemo).
// 3. GestureDemo creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a centered SimpleGestureDetector.
// 4. The SimpleGestureDetector listens for swipe, tap, and long press gestures.
// 5. When a gesture is detected, the corresponding callback is triggered, printing the gesture type to the console.
// 6. The child of SimpleGestureDetector is a blue container with text, which serves as the interactive area for gestures.
