```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio playback.</string>
<key>NSAppleMusicUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your music library.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the **coast_audio** package, you can create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class and utilize its methods to control audio playback.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:coast_audio/coast_audio.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late CoastAudio _audioPlayer;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _audioPlayer = CoastAudio();
  }

  void _playAudio() {
    _audioPlayer.play('https://example.com/audio.mp3');
  }

  void _pauseAudio() {
    _audioPlayer.pause();
  }

  void _stopAudio() {
    _audioPlayer.stop();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _audioPlayer.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Coast Audio Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(onPressed: _playAudio, child: Text('Play')),
            ElevatedButton(onPressed: _pauseAudio, child: Text('Pause')),
            ElevatedButton(onPressed: _stopAudio, child: Text('Stop')),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Coast Audio

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:coast_audio/coast_audio.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Coast Audio Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late CoastAudio _audioPlayer; // Declare the audio player

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _audioPlayer = CoastAudio(); // Initialize the audio player
  }

  void _playAudio() {
    _audioPlayer.play('https://example.com/audio.mp3'); // Play audio from a URL
  }

  void _pauseAudio() {
    _audioPlayer.pause(); // Pause the audio playback
  }

  void _stopAudio() {
    _audioPlayer.stop(); // Stop the audio playback
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _audioPlayer.dispose(); // Dispose of the audio player when done
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Coast Audio Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(onPressed: _playAudio, child: Text('Play')), // Button to play audio
            ElevatedButton(onPressed: _pauseAudio, child: Text('Pause')), // Button to pause audio
            ElevatedButton(onPressed: _stopAudio, child: Text('Stop')), // Button to stop audio
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with the title 'Coast Audio Demo' and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. In RealFlutter, the CoastAudio instance is created in initState.
// 4. The UI consists of three buttons: Play, Pause, and Stop.
// 5. When the Play button is pressed, the audio from the specified URL starts playing.
// 6. The Pause button pauses the audio playback, and the Stop button stops it completely.
// 7. The audio player is disposed of in the dispose method to free up resources when the widget is removed from the widget tree.
