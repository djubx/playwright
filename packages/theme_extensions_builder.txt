// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The RealFlutter class is defined, which uses the custom theme extension.
// 2. The custom theme extension is created and passed to the Theme widget.
// 3. The Theme widget uses the custom theme extension to create a ThemeData object.
// 4. The ThemeData object is used to style the application.
// 5. The application is run using the runApp function.

// In summary, the code flows as follows:
// RealFlutter class -> CustomThemeExtension class -> Theme widget -> ThemeData object -> Application styling.
