# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Yaru Window

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **yaru_window** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **yaru_window** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  yaru_window: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/yaru_window).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### For Android

1. Open the `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### For iOS

1. Open the `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following key to enable window customization:

```xml
<key>NSHighResolutionCapable</key>
<string>True</string>
```

## Step 3: Using Yaru Window in Your Application

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple application that demonstrates its features.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:yaru_window/yaru_window.dart';
```

2. Create a new class that extends `StatelessWidget` or `StatefulWidget` and implement the window features as needed.

### Example Code

Refer to the complete example section below for a fully functional code snippet.

# Complete Example of Yaru Window

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:yaru_window/yaru_window.dart';

void main() {
  // Run the application
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a YaruWindow instance
    return YaruWindow(
      title: 'Yaru Window Example',
      // Set the window size
      size: Size(800, 600),
      // Define the content of the window
      child: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Yaru Window Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Hello, Yaru Window!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the main UI.
// 3. Inside the build method, we create a YaruWindow instance.
// 4. We set the title and size of the window.
// 5. The child of the YaruWindow is a Scaffold widget that contains an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 6. The Center widget displays a simple text message.
// 7. When the application runs, it will display a window with the specified title and content.
```
