# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Daily Extensions

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **daily_extensions** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  daily_extensions: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the package to start using its features:

```dart
import 'package:daily_extensions/daily_extensions.dart';
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the extensions provided by the package. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use date and string extensions:

```dart
void main() {
  // Example of using date extensions
  DateTime today = DateTime.now();
  print(today.addDays(5)); // Adds 5 days to the current date

  // Example of using string extensions
  String text = "  Hello, Flutter!  ";
  print(text.trimAndCapitalize()); // Outputs: "Hello, flutter!"
}
```

This example demonstrates how to manipulate dates and strings using the extensions provided by the **daily_extensions** package.

# Complete Example of Daily Extensions

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:daily_extensions/daily_extensions.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Daily Extensions Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Daily Extensions Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text(
                'Today\'s Date: ${DateTime.now().toString()}',
              ),
              Text(
                'Date after 5 days: ${DateTime.now().addDays(5)}',
              ),
              Text(
                'Trimmed and Capitalized: ${"  hello, flutter!  ".trimAndCapitalize()}',
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the Flutter application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to display multiple Text widgets.
// 5. The first Text widget shows the current date and time.
// 6. The second Text widget displays the date after adding 5 days using the addDays extension.
// 7. The third Text widget shows a string that has been trimmed and capitalized using the trimAndCapitalize extension.
// 8. The application demonstrates the use of daily_extensions package features in a simple UI.
