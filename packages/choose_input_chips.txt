```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/choose_input_chips).

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21

    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `choose_input_chips` package, you can create a simple widget that utilizes the `ChooseInputChips` class. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:choose_input_chips/choose_input_chips.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  List<String> selectedOptions = [];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Choose Input Chips Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ChooseInputChips(
          options: ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3', 'Option 4'],
          selectedOptions: selectedOptions,
          onChanged: (List<String> selected) {
            setState(() {
              selectedOptions = selected; // Update the selected options
            });
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple app with a `ChooseInputChips` widget that allows users to select from a list of options. The `onChanged` callback updates the state with the currently selected options.

# Complete Example of `choose_input_chips`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:choose_input_chips/choose_input_chips.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // List to hold the selected options
  List<String> selectedOptions = [];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Choose Input Chips Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ChooseInputChips(
          // Define the options available for selection
          options: ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3', 'Option 4'],
          selectedOptions: selectedOptions, // Pass the selected options
          onChanged: (List<String> selected) {
            setState(() {
              selectedOptions = selected; // Update the state with selected options
            });
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The main function to run the app
void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    home: RealFlutter(), // Set the home widget to RealFlutter
  ));
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MaterialApp.
2. The RealFlutter widget is set as the home of the app.
3. Inside RealFlutter, we maintain a list of selected options.
4. The ChooseInputChips widget is displayed in the center of the screen.
5. Users can select multiple options from the chips displayed.
6. When an option is selected or deselected, the onChanged callback is triggered.
7. The selected options are updated in the state, causing the UI to refresh and reflect the current selections.
