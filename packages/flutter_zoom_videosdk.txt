# Setting Up the Flutter Zoom Video SDK

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_zoom_videosdk` package, including platform-specific configurations for both Android and iOS.

## Installation

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter_zoom_videosdk: ^latest_version
   ```

   Replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

2. **Run Flutter Packages Get**: Execute the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

1. **Update Android Manifest**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
   ```

2. **Add Zoom SDK Key**: You will need to add your Zoom SDK key and secret in the `MainActivity.java` or `MainActivity.kt` file:

   ```java
   import us.zoom.sdk.ZoomSDK;
   import us.zoom.sdk.ZoomSDKInitializeListener;

   public class MainActivity extends FlutterActivity {
       @Override
       public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
           super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
           ZoomSDK zoomSDK = ZoomSDK.getInstance();
           zoomSDK.initialize(this, "YOUR_SDK_KEY", "YOUR_SDK_SECRET", new ZoomSDKInitializeListener() {
               @Override
               public void onZoomSDKInitializeResult(int errorCode, int internalErrorCode) {
                   // Handle initialization result
               }
           });
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your camera for video calls.</string>
   <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your microphone for audio calls.</string>
   ```

2. **Add Zoom SDK Key**: Similar to Android, you will need to initialize the Zoom SDK in your `AppDelegate.swift`:

   ```swift
   import UIKit
   import Flutter
   import MobileRTC

   @UIApplicationMain
   class AppDelegate: FlutterAppDelegate {
       override func application(
           _ application: UIApplication,
           didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?
       ) -> Bool {
           MobileRTC.shared().initializeWithDomain("zoom.us", appKey: "YOUR_SDK_KEY", appSecret: "YOUR_SDK_SECRET")
           return super.application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: launchOptions)
       }
   }
   ```

## Conclusion
After completing the above steps, your Flutter application will be ready to utilize the Zoom Video SDK. Make sure to test the integration thoroughly on both Android and iOS devices.

# Complete Example of Using Flutter Zoom Video SDK

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_zoom_videosdk/flutter_zoom_videosdk.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Initialize the Zoom SDK
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    ZoomVideoSDK.initialize('YOUR_SDK_KEY', 'YOUR_SDK_SECRET');
  }

  // Function to start a meeting
  void startMeeting() async {
    // Create a meeting object
    var meeting = ZoomVideoSDKMeetingOptions(
      meetingId: 'YOUR_MEETING_ID',
      userName: 'Your Name',
      userId: 'YOUR_USER_ID',
      meetingPassword: 'YOUR_MEETING_PASSWORD',
    );

    // Start the meeting
    ZoomVideoSDK.startMeeting(meeting);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Zoom Video SDK Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: startMeeting, // Start meeting on button press
            child: Text('Start Meeting'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the initState method, the Zoom SDK is initialized with your SDK key and secret.
// 3. The build method creates a simple UI with an AppBar and a button.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the startMeeting function is called.
// 5. The startMeeting function creates a meeting object with the required parameters and starts the meeting using the Zoom SDK.
// 6. The user will then be taken to the Zoom meeting interface.
