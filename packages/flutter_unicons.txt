# flutter_unicons: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with `flutter_unicons`, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and include the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_unicons: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 9.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
```

## Usage
To use the icons in your Flutter application, you can import the package as follows:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_unicons/flutter_unicons.dart';
```

You can then use the icons in your widgets. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use an icon:

```dart
Icon(UniconsLine.home, size: 30, color: Colors.blue);
```

This will render a home icon with a size of 30 and a blue color.

### Customization
You can customize the icons further by adjusting their size and color properties. For example:

```dart
Icon(
  UniconsLine.user,
  size: 50, // Custom size
  color: Colors.red, // Custom color
);
```

This flexibility allows you to match the icons with your app's design language seamlessly.

With these steps, you are now ready to integrate `flutter_unicons` into your Flutter application and start using its extensive icon library.

# Complete Example of flutter_unicons in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_unicons/flutter_unicons.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Unicons Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Unicons Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Displaying a home icon
            Icon(
              UniconsLine.home,
              size: 100, // Setting the size of the icon
              color: Colors.blue, // Setting the color of the icon
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
            // Displaying a user icon
            Icon(
              UniconsLine.user,
              size: 100, // Setting the size of the icon
              color: Colors.red, // Setting the color of the icon
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
            // Displaying a settings icon
            Icon(
              UniconsLine.setting,
              size: 100, // Setting the size of the icon
              color: Colors.green, // Setting the color of the icon
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to HomeScreen, which is another StatelessWidget.
// 4. HomeScreen builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget containing a Column.
// 5. The Column displays three icons: home, user, and settings, each with specified sizes and colors.
// 6. SizedBox widgets are used to add spacing between the icons for better visual separation.
