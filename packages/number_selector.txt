# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Number Selector Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **number_selector** package, you first need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  number_selector: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the number selector, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:number_selector/number_selector.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Number Selector Widget

You can now use the `NumberSelector` widget in your application. Below is an example of how to implement it in a simple Flutter app.

### Platform-Specific Details

- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid compatibility issues.
  
  ```gradle
  android {
      ...
      defaultConfig {
          ...
          minSdkVersion 21
          ...
      }
  }
  ```

- **iOS**: For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

  ```ruby
  platform :ios, '10.0'
  ```

## Step 4: Customizing the Number Selector

You can customize the appearance and behavior of the `NumberSelector` widget by using its various properties, such as `minValue`, `maxValue`, `initialValue`, and `step`.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the `NumberSelector`:

```dart
NumberSelector(
  minValue: 0,
  maxValue: 100,
  initialValue: 50,
  step: 1,
  onChanged: (value) {
    print("Selected value: $value");
  },
)
```

This setup allows users to select a number between 0 and 100, starting at 50, with increments of 1.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the **number_selector** package into your Flutter application seamlessly.

# Complete Example of Using the Number Selector Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:number_selector/number_selector.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Number Selector Example',
      home: NumberSelectorPage(),
    );
  }
}

class NumberSelectorPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _NumberSelectorPageState createState() => _NumberSelectorPageState();
}

class _NumberSelectorPageState extends State<NumberSelectorPage> {
  // Variable to hold the selected number
  int _selectedNumber = 50;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Number Selector Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display the currently selected number
            Text(
              'Selected Number: $_selectedNumber',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Number selector widget
            NumberSelector(
              minValue: 0, // Minimum value
              maxValue: 100, // Maximum value
              initialValue: _selectedNumber, // Initial value
              step: 1, // Step increment
              onChanged: (value) {
                // Update the selected number when changed
                setState(() {
                  _selectedNumber = value;
                });
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home page (NumberSelectorPage).
// 3. NumberSelectorPage is a stateful widget that maintains the selected number.
// 4. The selected number is displayed in a Text widget.
// 5. The NumberSelector widget allows users to select a number between 0 and 100.
// 6. When the user changes the number, the onChanged callback updates the state, 
//    which triggers a rebuild to display the new selected number.
```
