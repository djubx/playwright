# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Draggable Carousel Slider

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the **draggable_carousel_slider** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  draggable_carousel_slider: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the draggable carousel slider.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:draggable_carousel_slider/draggable_carousel_slider.dart';
```

2. Create a widget that uses the `DraggableCarouselSlider`:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Draggable Carousel Slider Example')),
      body: DraggableCarouselSlider(
        items: [
          Container(color: Colors.red, child: Center(child: Text('Item 1'))),
          Container(color: Colors.green, child: Center(child: Text('Item 2'))),
          Container(color: Colors.blue, child: Center(child: Text('Item 3'))),
        ],
        onItemChanged: (index) {
          print('Current index: $index');
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Run your application to see the draggable carousel in action!

This setup provides a basic implementation of the draggable carousel slider. You can further customize the appearance and behavior by exploring the package documentation for additional properties and methods.

# Complete Example of Draggable Carousel Slider

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:draggable_carousel_slider/draggable_carousel_slider.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Draggable Carousel Slider',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Draggable Carousel Slider Example')),
      body: DraggableCarouselSlider(
        items: [
          // Each item in the carousel is a Container with a different color and text
          Container(color: Colors.red, child: Center(child: Text('Item 1'))),
          Container(color: Colors.green, child: Center(child: Text('Item 2'))),
          Container(color: Colors.blue, child: Center(child: Text('Item 3'))),
        ],
        onItemChanged: (index) {
          // This callback is triggered when the user drags to a new item
          print('Current index: $index');
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home widget.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget is displayed as the home screen, containing an AppBar and a DraggableCarouselSlider.
// 4. The DraggableCarouselSlider takes a list of items (Containers) and displays them in a draggable format.
// 5. When the user drags the carousel, the onItemChanged callback is triggered, printing the current index to the console.
// 6. Each item in the carousel is a colored Container with centered text, providing a simple visual representation of the carousel functionality.
