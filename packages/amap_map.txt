# Setting Up the Amap Map Flutter Package
------------------------------------------

To use the Amap Map Flutter package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

Add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  amap_map_fluttify: ^x.x.x
```

Replace `x.x.x` with the latest version of the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:amap_map_fluttify/amap_map_fluttify.dart';
```

### Step 3: Initialize the Amap Map

Initialize the Amap map using the `AmapMap` widget:

```dart
AmapMap(
  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  onMapCreated: (controller) {
    // Use the controller to interact with the map
  },
)
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual Amap API key.

### Platform-Specific Details

*   **Android**: Make sure to add the Amap API key to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

    ```xml
<meta-data
  android:name="com.amap.api.v2.apikey"
  android:value="YOUR_API_KEY" />
```

*   **iOS**: Make sure to add the Amap API key to your `Info.plist` file:

    ```xml
<key>AMapApiKey</key>
<string>YOUR_API_KEY</string>
```

### Required Configurations and Optimizations

*   **Permissions**: Make sure to add the necessary permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

    ```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
```

*   **Lifecycle Methods**: Make sure to call the `onResume` and `onPause` methods of the `AmapMap` controller to handle lifecycle events:

    ```dart
@override
void onResume() {
  super.onResume();
  _controller?.onResume();
}

@override
void onPause() {
  super.onPause();
  _controller?.onPause();
}
```

      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          // Add a marker to the map
          _controller?.addMarker(
            MarkerOption(
              latLng: LatLng(39.90923, 116.397428),
              title: 'Marker',
            ),
          );
        },
        tooltip: 'Add Marker',
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Use the controller to interact with the map
  void _onMapCreated(AmapMapController controller) {
    setState(() {
      _controller = controller;
    });
  }

  // Handle lifecycle events
  @override
  void onResume() {
    super.onResume();
    _controller?.onResume();
  }

  @override
  void onPause() {
    super.onPause();
    _controller?.onPause();
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user opens the app and is presented with a map view.
// 2. The user can interact with the map by zooming, panning, and tapping on markers.
// 3. When the user taps the floating action button, a new marker is added to the map.
// 4. The marker is displayed on the map with a title and a lat/lng position.
// 5. The user can continue to interact with the map and add more markers as needed.

// This code demonstrates the basic functionality of the Amap Map Flutter package.
// It shows how to initialize the map, add markers, and handle lifecycle events.
// It also provides a simple example of how to use the controller to interact with the map.

// To use this code, simply replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual Amap API key.
// Then, run the app on a device or emulator to see the map in action.
