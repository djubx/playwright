# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_dropdown_alert

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_dropdown_alert` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_dropdown_alert: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

To use the `flutter_dropdown_alert` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_dropdown_alert/flutter_dropdown_alert.dart';
```

Next, you can create an instance of the `DropdownAlert` widget in your app. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to show a dropdown alert:

```dart
DropdownAlert(
  title: "Success",
  message: "Your data has been saved successfully!",
  type: AlertType.success,
);
```

You can customize the title, message, and type of alert as needed.

## Step 4: Displaying Alerts

To display alerts, you can call the `show` method on the `DropdownAlert` instance. This can be done in response to user actions, such as button presses.

```dart
void showAlert() {
  DropdownAlert.show(
    title: "Error",
    message: "An error occurred while saving your data.",
    type: AlertType.error,
  );
}
```

With these steps, you can easily integrate and use the `flutter_dropdown_alert` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of flutter_dropdown_alert

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_dropdown_alert/flutter_dropdown_alert.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dropdown Alert Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  // Create an instance of DropdownAlert
  final DropdownAlert dropdownAlert = DropdownAlert();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Dropdown Alert Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Show success alert when button is pressed
            dropdownAlert.show(
              title: "Success",
              message: "Your data has been saved successfully!",
              type: AlertType.success,
            );
          },
          child: Text('Show Success Alert'),
        ),
      ),
      // Add the DropdownAlert widget to the widget tree
      floatingActionButton: dropdownAlert,
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget contains a button that, when pressed, triggers the dropdown alert.
// 4. The dropdown alert is displayed at the top of the screen with a success message.
// 5. The DropdownAlert widget is added to the floating action button area, allowing it to be displayed on top of other widgets.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application that demonstrates how to use the `flutter_dropdown_alert` package. The application consists of a button that, when pressed, shows a success alert. The dropdown alert is integrated into the app's UI, providing a seamless user experience.

### Summary of Application Flow
- The app starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` widget.
- The `RealFlutter` widget sets up the main structure of the app, including the title and home screen.
- The `HomeScreen` widget contains a button that, when clicked, triggers the dropdown alert to display a success message.
- The dropdown alert is shown at the top of the screen, providing feedback to the user without interrupting their workflow.

This structure allows for easy customization and integration of dropdown alerts in any Flutter application, enhancing user interaction and feedback.
