# Flutter ORM: A Comprehensive Overview

The `flutter_orm` package is a powerful Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) solution for Flutter applications. It simplifies database interactions by allowing developers to work with Dart objects instead of writing raw SQL queries. This package is particularly useful for applications that require persistent data storage, such as note-taking apps, task managers, or any app that needs to manage user-generated content.

## When to Use `flutter_orm`
- **Data Persistence**: When your application needs to store data locally on the device.
- **Complex Data Models**: If your app has complex data relationships and you want to manage them easily.
- **Rapid Development**: When you want to speed up development by reducing boilerplate code associated with database operations.

## Key Features
- **Easy Data Mapping**: Automatically maps Dart objects to database tables.
- **Query Builder**: Provides a fluent API for building complex queries.
- **Migration Support**: Handles database schema migrations seamlessly.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on both Android and iOS without additional configuration.

Overall, `flutter_orm` is an excellent choice for Flutter developers looking to simplify their database interactions while maintaining a clean and efficient codebase.

# Setting Up and Using `flutter_orm`

## Installation
To get started with `flutter_orm`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_orm: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_orm).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21.
2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml` if your app requires internet access or other features.

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode.
2. Ensure that you have the correct permissions set in `Info.plist` for data storage.

## Basic Usage
To use `flutter_orm`, you need to define your data models. Hereâ€™s a simple example of a `Note` model:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_orm/flutter_orm.dart';

@Entity()
class Note {
  @PrimaryKey()
  final int id;
  final String title;
  final String content;

  Note({
    required this.id,
    required this.title,
    required this.content,
  });
}
```

Next, you can initialize the database and perform CRUD operations:

```dart
void main() async {
  // Initialize the ORM
  await RealFlutter.init();

  // Create a new note
  Note newNote = Note(id: 1, title: 'My First Note', content: 'This is the content of my first note.');
  await RealFlutter.insert(newNote);

  // Fetch all notes
  List<Note> notes = await RealFlutter.query<Note>();
}
```

This setup allows you to easily manage your data without dealing with SQL directly. The `flutter_orm` package takes care of the underlying database operations, making your code cleaner and more maintainable.

# Complete Example of `flutter_orm`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_orm/flutter_orm.dart';

// Define the Note entity
@Entity()
class Note {
  @PrimaryKey()
  final int id;
  final String title;
  final String content;

  Note({
    required this.id,
    required this.title,
    required this.content,
  });
}

// Main application class
void main() async {
  // Initialize the ORM
  await RealFlutter.init();
  
  // Run the app
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter ORM Example',
      home: NoteListScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class NoteListScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _NoteListScreenState createState() => _NoteListScreenState();
}

class _NoteListScreenState extends State<NoteListScreen> {
  List<Note> notes = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _fetchNotes(); // Fetch notes when the screen initializes
  }

  // Fetch notes from the database
  Future<void> _fetchNotes() async {
    notes = await RealFlutter.query<Note>(); // Query all notes
    setState(() {}); // Update the UI
  }

  // Add a new note
  Future<void> _addNote() async {
    Note newNote = Note(id: notes.length + 1, title: 'New Note', content: 'This is a new note.');
    await RealFlutter.insert(newNote); // Insert the new note
    _fetchNotes(); // Refresh the note list
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Notes'),
        actions: [
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.add),
            onPressed: _addNote, // Add note button
          ),
        ],
      ),
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: notes.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return ListTile(
            title: Text(notes[index].title), // Display note title
            subtitle: Text(notes[index].content), // Display note content
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, initializing the ORM.
// 2. The MyApp widget is created, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. The NoteListScreen is displayed, which fetches notes from the database.
// 4. The user can add a new note by pressing the add button in the app bar.
// 5. When a new note is added, it is inserted into the database, and the list is refreshed to show the updated notes.
