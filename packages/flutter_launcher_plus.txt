# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_launcher_plus

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_launcher_plus` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_launcher_plus` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_launcher_plus: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Configuring for Android

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and ensure you have the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

2. **Add Icons**: Place your launcher icons in the appropriate drawable folders (`mipmap-mdpi`, `mipmap-hdpi`, etc.) under `android/app/src/main/res/`.

## Step 3: Configuring for iOS

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

   ```xml
   <key>CFBundleIcons</key>
   <dict>
       <key>CFBundlePrimaryIcon</key>
       <dict>
           <key>CFBundleIconFiles</key>
           <array>
               <string>AppIcon</string>
           </array>
       </dict>
   </dict>
   ```

2. **Add Icons**: Add your app icons to the `Assets.xcassets` folder in Xcode.

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is an example of how to implement it.

# Complete Example: Using flutter_launcher_plus

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_launcher_plus/flutter_launcher_plus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Launcher Plus Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Welcome to RealFlutter!'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () async {
                // Change the app icon dynamically
                await FlutterLauncherPlus.setIcon('new_icon');
              },
              child: Text('Change App Icon'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to HomeScreen, which is another StatelessWidget.
// 4. HomeScreen displays a welcome message and a button to change the app icon.
// 5. When the button is pressed, it calls the setIcon method from flutter_launcher_plus to change the app icon dynamically.
```

// The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget. 
// The RealFlutter widget sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme, and it directs to the HomeScreen.
// The HomeScreen contains a welcome message and a button. 
// When the button is pressed, it triggers the setIcon method from the flutter_launcher_plus package, allowing the user to change the app icon dynamically.

In summary, the `flutter_launcher_plus` package provides a straightforward way to manage app icons and splash screens in Flutter applications. By following the setup and usage instructions outlined in this blog, developers can easily implement custom branding and enhance the user experience in their apps.
