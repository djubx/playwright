# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Image Stickers Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the **image_stickers** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  image_stickers: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/image_stickers).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration
For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you plan to access the camera or photo library:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to add stickers to your images.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to take photos with stickers.</string>
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:image_stickers/image_stickers.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package
You can now use the **image_stickers** package in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement it.

# Complete Example of Using the Image Stickers Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:image_stickers/image_stickers.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Image Stickers Example',
      home: ImageStickerPage(),
    );
  }
}

class ImageStickerPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ImageStickerPageState createState() => _ImageStickerPageState();
}

class _ImageStickerPageState extends State<ImageStickerPage> {
  // Variable to hold the image file
  String imagePath = 'assets/sample_image.png'; // Path to your image
  List<Sticker> stickers = []; // List to hold stickers

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Image Stickers'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          children: [
            // Display the image with stickers
            Expanded(
              child: ImageStickers(
                image: AssetImage(imagePath),
                stickers: stickers,
                onStickerAdded: (sticker) {
                  // Add sticker to the list when added
                  setState(() {
                    stickers.add(sticker);
                  });
                },
              ),
            ),
            // Button to add a sticker
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Example of adding a sticker
                setState(() {
                  stickers.add(Sticker(
                    image: AssetImage('assets/sticker.png'), // Path to your sticker
                    position: Offset(100, 100), // Initial position of the sticker
                  ));
                });
              },
              child: Text('Add Sticker'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation
// The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` widget.
// The `RealFlutter` widget sets up a MaterialApp with a title and a home page.
// The `ImageStickerPage` widget is a stateful widget that manages the image and stickers.
// In the `build` method, an `ImageStickers` widget is used to display the image and any added stickers.
// The `onStickerAdded` callback updates the state when a sticker is added.
// An ElevatedButton allows users to add a sticker to the image, which updates the list of stickers and re-renders the image with the new sticker.
// The application provides a simple interface for users to interact with images and stickers dynamically.
