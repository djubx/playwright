      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user opens the app and is presented with a screen displaying device information.
// 2. The app checks for network connectivity and displays the result.
// 3. The app retrieves storage information and displays it.
// 4. The user can view the device information, network connectivity, and storage information.
// 5. The app updates the display in real-time if the network connectivity changes.
```

// The code flows in the following order:
// 1. The `RealFlutter` widget is created and retrieves device information.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` widget checks for network connectivity.
// 3. The `RealFlutter` widget retrieves storage information.
// 4. The `RealFlutter` widget builds the UI and displays the device information, network connectivity, and storage information.
// 5. The `RealFlutter` widget updates the display in real-time if the network connectivity changes.
