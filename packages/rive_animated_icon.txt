      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Rive Animated Icon Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: RiveAnimatedIcon(
            'assets/your_animation.riv', // Path to your Rive file
            size: 100, // Size of the icon
            onTap: () {

  }
}
```

```
// The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// The MaterialApp contains a title and a home Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// The Center widget holds the RiveAnimatedIcon, which takes the path to the Rive file and a size.
// The onTap callback is defined to print a message when the icon is tapped.
