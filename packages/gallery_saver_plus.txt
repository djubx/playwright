# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Gallery Saver Plus

## Installation
To get started with `gallery_saver_plus`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  gallery_saver_plus: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/gallery_saver_plus).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. **Permissions**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

2. **Target SDK**: Make sure your `targetSdkVersion` is set to 29 or higher in your `build.gradle` file to comply with scoped storage requirements.

### iOS
1. **Permissions**: Add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file to request permission to access the photo library:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save images and videos.</string>
```

## Using the Package
To save an image or video, you can use the following methods provided by the package:

```dart
import 'package:gallery_saver_plus/gallery_saver_plus.dart';

// Save an image
await GallerySaver.saveImage('https://example.com/image.jpg');

// Save a video
await GallerySaver.saveVideo('https://example.com/video.mp4');
```

This simple API allows you to save media files with just a few lines of code. Make sure to handle permissions appropriately, especially on Android devices.

# Complete Example: Using Gallery Saver Plus in a Flutter App

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gallery_saver_plus/gallery_saver_plus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Gallery Saver Plus Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Gallery Saver Plus Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () async {
                  // URL of the image to save
                  String imageUrl = 'https://example.com/image.jpg';
                  // Save the image to the gallery
                  final result = await GallerySaver.saveImage(imageUrl);
                  // Show a message based on the result
                  if (result != null && result) {
                    ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                      SnackBar(content: Text('Image saved to gallery!')),
                    );
                  } else {
                    ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                      SnackBar(content: Text('Failed to save image.')),
                    );
                  }
                },
                child: Text('Save Image'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () async {
                  // URL of the video to save
                  String videoUrl = 'https://example.com/video.mp4';
                  // Save the video to the gallery
                  final result = await GallerySaver.saveVideo(videoUrl);
                  // Show a message based on the result
                  if (result != null && result) {
                    ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                      SnackBar(content: Text('Video saved to gallery!')),
                    );
                  } else {
                    ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                      SnackBar(content: Text('Failed to save video.')),
                    );
                  }
                },
                child: Text('Save Video'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, there are two buttons: "Save Image" and "Save Video".
// 4. When the "Save Image" button is pressed, it calls the saveImage method from the GallerySaver class with the image URL.
// 5. The result of the save operation is checked, and a SnackBar message is displayed to inform the user of the success or failure.
// 6. Similarly, when the "Save Video" button is pressed, it calls the saveVideo method with the video URL and handles the result.
// 7. The user receives feedback through SnackBar messages for both operations.
