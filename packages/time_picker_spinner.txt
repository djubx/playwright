# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Time Picker Spinner

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `time_picker_spinner` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  time_picker_spinner: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Time Picker Spinner

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `TimePickerSpinner` widget.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:time_picker_spinner/time_picker_spinner.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Time Picker Spinner Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: TimePickerSpinner(
            is24HourMode: true, // Set to true for 24-hour format
            normalTextStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.black),
            highlightedTextStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.blue),
            spacing: 20, // Space between the spinners
            itemHeight: 60, // Height of each spinner item
            onTimeChange: (time) {
              print("Selected time: ${time.hour}:${time.minute}");
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays a time picker spinner in the center of the screen. The selected time is printed to the console whenever the user changes the time.

# Complete Example of Time Picker Spinner

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:time_picker_spinner/time_picker_spinner.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Time Picker Spinner Example'), // Title of the app
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: TimePickerSpinner(
            is24HourMode: true, // Enables 24-hour format
            normalTextStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.black), // Style for normal text
            highlightedTextStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.blue), // Style for highlighted text
            spacing: 20, // Space between the spinners
            itemHeight: 60, // Height of each spinner item
            onTimeChange: (time) { // Callback when time changes
              print("Selected time: ${time.hour}:${time.minute}"); // Print selected time to console
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the app
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, the TimePickerSpinner is displayed, allowing users to select time.
// 4. The TimePickerSpinner is configured to use a 24-hour format and has custom text styles for normal and highlighted states.
// 5. When the user changes the time, the onTimeChange callback is triggered, printing the selected time to the console.
