# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Clean Calendar

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **clean_calendar** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **clean_calendar** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  clean_calendar: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to access the calendar. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_CALENDAR"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_CALENDAR"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file to request permission to access the calendar:

```xml
<key>NSCalendarsUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your calendar to manage events.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the **clean_calendar** package in your app.

<!-- END_TUTORIAL -->

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:clean_calendar/clean_calendar.dart'; // Import the clean_calendar package

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Clean Calendar Example',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: RealFlutter(), // Set the home to our main calendar widget
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Initialize a list to hold calendar events
  List<CalendarEvent> events = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Load initial events (if any)
    loadEvents();
  }

  // Function to load events from the calendar
  void loadEvents() {
    // Here you would typically fetch events from the device's calendar
    // For demonstration, we will add a sample event
    events.add(CalendarEvent(
      title: 'Sample Event',
      description: 'This is a sample event.',
      start: DateTime.now(),
      end: DateTime.now().add(Duration(hours: 1)),
    ));
  }

  // Function to add a new event
  void addEvent() {
    setState(() {
      events.add(CalendarEvent(
        title: 'New Event',
        description: 'This is a new event.',
        start: DateTime.now(),
        end: DateTime.now().add(Duration(hours: 1)),
      ));
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Clean Calendar'),
        actions: [
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.add),
            onPressed: addEvent, // Add event on button press
          ),
        ],
      ),
      body: CleanCalendar(
        events: events, // Pass the list of events to the calendar
        onEventTap: (event) {
          // Handle event tap
          showDialog(
            context: context,
            builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
              title: Text(event.title),
              content: Text(event.description),
              actions: [
                TextButton(
                  onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                  child: Text('Close'),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The home of the app is set to RealFlutter, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 3. In the _RealFlutterState, we initialize a list to hold calendar events.
// 4. The loadEvents function is called in initState to load initial events.
// 5. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a CleanCalendar widget.
// 6. The CleanCalendar widget displays the events and handles event taps.
// 7. When the add button is pressed, a new event is added to the list and the calendar is updated.
