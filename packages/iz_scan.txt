Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import iz_scan in Your Dart File

Import the iz_scan package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:iz_scan/iz_scan.dart';
```
### Step 3: Create a Scanning Interface

Create a scanning interface using the `IzScan` widget:
```dart
IzScan(
  onScanResult: (result) {
    print(result);
  },
)
```
### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

Add the following lines to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera" />
```
#### iOS

Add the following lines to your `Info.plist` file:
```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs camera access to scan barcodes</string>
```

      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,

}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _scanResult = '';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('iz_scan Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            IzScan(
              onScanResult: (result) {
                setState(() {
                  _scanResult = result;
                });
              },
            ),
            Text(_scanResult),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
// Here's how the code flows:
// 1. The user opens the app and is presented with a scanning interface.
// 2. The user scans a barcode or QR code using the camera.
// 3. The iz_scan package processes the scan result and returns it to the app.
// 4. The app displays the scan result on the screen.
// 5. The user can repeat the scanning process as needed.
