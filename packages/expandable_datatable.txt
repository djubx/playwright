# Overview of the `expandable_datatable` Flutter Package

The `expandable_datatable` package is a powerful Flutter widget that allows developers to create expandable data tables with ease. This package is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets where users may want to view additional details without navigating away from the main table view. 

### When to Use This Package
- **Data-Driven Applications**: Ideal for applications that display large amounts of data, such as inventory systems, financial applications, or any app that requires detailed data representation.
- **User-Friendly Interfaces**: When you want to provide a clean and user-friendly interface that allows users to expand rows for more information without cluttering the UI.

### Key Features
- **Expandable Rows**: Each row can be expanded to show additional information.
- **Customizable**: You can customize the appearance and behavior of the data table to fit your app's design.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on both Android and iOS platforms, adapting to different screen sizes.

The `expandable_datatable` package enhances the user experience by allowing users to interact with data in a more meaningful way, making it a valuable addition to any Flutter developer's toolkit.

# Setting Up the `expandable_datatable` Package

To get started with the `expandable_datatable` package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add Dependency
Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  expandable_datatable: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/expandable_datatable).

### Step 2: Install the Package
Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
#### For Android
Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

#### For iOS
In your `ios/Podfile`, ensure that the platform is set to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

### Step 4: Import the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:expandable_datatable/expandable_datatable.dart';
```

### Step 5: Basic Usage
You can now use the `ExpandableDataTable` widget in your Flutter application. Here’s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
ExpandableDataTable(
  columns: [
    DataColumn(label: Text('Name')),
    DataColumn(label: Text('Age')),
    DataColumn(label: Text('Details')),
  ],
  rows: [
    DataRow(cells: [
      DataCell(Text('John Doe')),
      DataCell(Text('30')),
      DataCell(Text('Click to expand')),
    ]),
    // Add more rows as needed
  ],
)
```

This basic setup will create a data table with expandable rows. You can customize the rows and columns as per your requirements.

### Conclusion
With these steps, you should be able to set up and start using the `expandable_datatable` package in your Flutter application. The next section will provide a complete example demonstrating all key features of the package.

## Part 3: Complete Example

<!-- START_MAIN -->
# Complete Example of `expandable_datatable`

Here’s a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the `expandable_datatable` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:expandable_datatable/expandable_datatable.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Expandable DataTable Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Expandable DataTable Example'),
        ),
        body: ExpandableDataTableExample(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class ExpandableDataTableExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return SingleChildScrollView(
      child: ExpandableDataTable(
        columns: [
          DataColumn(label: Text('Name')),
          DataColumn(label: Text('Age')),
          DataColumn(label: Text('Details')),
        ],
        rows: [
          DataRow(cells: [
            DataCell(Text('John Doe')),
            DataCell(Text('30')),
            DataCell(Text('Click to expand')),
          ], onSelectChanged: (isSelected) {
            // Handle row selection
          }),
          DataRow(cells: [
            DataCell(Text('Jane Smith')),
            DataCell(Text('25')),
            DataCell(Text('Click to expand')),
          ], onSelectChanged: (isSelected) {
            // Handle row selection
          }),
        ],
        expandedRowBuilder: (context, row) {
          // This function builds the expanded content for each row
          return Container(
            padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
            color: Colors.grey[200],
            child: Column(
              crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
              children: [
                Text('Additional details about ${row.cells[0].child}'),
                Text('This row contains more information.'),
              ],
            ),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation
// The main function initializes the Flutter app and sets up the MyApp widget.
// MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and the body.
// The body contains the ExpandableDataTableExample widget, which is responsible for displaying the expandable data table.
// Inside ExpandableDataTableExample, we define the columns and rows for the data table.
// Each DataRow has cells that display the name and age, and a DataCell that prompts the user to click to expand.
// The expandedRowBuilder function is used to define what content is shown when a row is expanded.
// In this example, it shows additional details about the selected person.
// The table is wrapped in a SingleChildScrollView to ensure it is scrollable if the content exceeds the screen height.
