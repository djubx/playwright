Here's a detailed technical blog on the "advanced_graphview" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Advanced GraphView Flutter Package

The **advanced_graphview** package is a powerful tool for creating interactive and visually appealing graph structures in Flutter applications. It allows developers to represent complex data relationships in a clear and intuitive manner, making it ideal for applications that require data visualization, such as social networks, organizational charts, or any hierarchical data representation.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the **advanced_graphview** package when:
- You need to visualize relationships between data points.
- Your application requires interactive graphs that users can manipulate.
- You want to create dynamic layouts that can adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.

## Key Features
- **Customizable Nodes and Edges**: You can easily customize the appearance of nodes and edges to fit your application's design.
- **Interactive Graphs**: Users can interact with the graphs, such as dragging nodes or zooming in and out.
- **Flexible Layouts**: The package supports various layout algorithms, allowing you to choose the best representation for your data.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Designed to handle large datasets efficiently without compromising performance.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Advanced GraphView

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **advanced_graphview** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  advanced_graphview: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/advanced_graphview).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configurations

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:advanced_graphview/advanced_graphview.dart';
```

## Step 4: Basic Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a basic graph:

```dart
Graph graph = Graph();
Node node1 = Node.Id('1');
Node node2 = Node.Id('2');
graph.addNode(node1);
graph.addNode(node2);
graph.addEdge(node1, node2);
```

This code snippet creates a graph with two nodes and connects them with an edge.

## Step 5: Customizing Nodes and Edges

You can customize the appearance of nodes and edges by using the `Node` and `Edge` classes. For example:

```dart
Node node1 = Node.Id('1', color: Colors.blue, size: 50);
```

This creates a blue node with a size of 50.

## Step 6: Building the GraphView Widget

Finally, you can build the graph view in your widget tree:

```dart
GraphView graphView = GraphView(graph: graph);
```

Now you can include `graphView` in your widget tree to display the graph.

# Complete Example of Advanced GraphView

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:advanced_graphview/advanced_graphview.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Advanced GraphView Example',
      home: GraphScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class GraphScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a new graph instance
    Graph graph = Graph();

    // Create nodes
    Node node1 = Node.Id('1', color: Colors.blue, size: 50);
    Node node2 = Node.Id('2', color: Colors.red, size: 50);
    Node node3 = Node.Id('3', color: Colors.green, size: 50);

    // Add nodes to the graph
    graph.addNode(node1);
    graph.addNode(node2);
    graph.addNode(node3);

    // Create edges between nodes
    graph.addEdge(node1, node2);
    graph.addEdge(node2, node3);
    graph.addEdge(node1, node3);

    // Create a GraphView widget
    GraphView graphView = GraphView(graph: graph);

    // Return a Scaffold with the GraphView
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('GraphView Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: graphView,
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (GraphScreen).
// 3. In GraphScreen, a new Graph instance is created.
// 4. Three nodes are created with different colors and sizes.
// 5. The nodes are added to the graph.
// 6. Edges are created to connect the nodes, establishing relationships.
// 7. A GraphView widget is created to visualize the graph.
// 8. The Scaffold widget displays the GraphView in the center of the screen.
```

In this blog, we explored the **advanced_graphview** Flutter package, detailing its features, setup process, and providing a complete example. The application flow is straightforward: it initializes a graph, adds nodes and edges, and displays the graph in a user-friendly interface. This package is a great choice for developers looking to implement interactive graph visualizations in their Flutter applications.
