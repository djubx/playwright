# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Fluid Action Card

## Installation
To use the fluid_action_card package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  fluid_action_card: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/fluid_action_card).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package
Once the package is installed, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a fluid action card.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fluid_action_card/fluid_action_card.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Fluid Action Card Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: FluidActionCard(
            title: 'Action Card',
            description: 'This is a fluid action card example.',
            actions: [
              FluidAction(
                icon: Icons.edit,
                label: 'Edit',
                onPressed: () {
                  // Handle edit action
                },
              ),
              FluidAction(
                icon: Icons.delete,
                label: 'Delete',
                onPressed: () {
                  // Handle delete action
                },
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays a fluid action card with two actions: Edit and Delete. Each action has an icon and a label, and you can define what happens when the user taps on them.

# Complete Example of Fluid Action Card

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fluid_action_card/fluid_action_card.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Fluid Action Card Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: FluidActionCard(
            title: 'Action Card', // Title of the action card
            description: 'This is a fluid action card example.', // Description of the card
            actions: [ // List of actions available on the card
              FluidAction(
                icon: Icons.edit, // Icon for the edit action
                label: 'Edit', // Label for the edit action
                onPressed: () {
                  // Handle edit action
                  print('Edit action pressed');
                },
              ),
              FluidAction(
                icon: Icons.delete, // Icon for the delete action
                label: 'Delete', // Label for the delete action
                onPressed: () {
                  // Handle delete action
                  print('Delete action pressed');
                },
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, a FluidActionCard is created with a title and description.
// 4. The card contains two actions: Edit and Delete, each with an icon and a label.
// 5. When the user taps on either action, a corresponding message is printed to the console.
