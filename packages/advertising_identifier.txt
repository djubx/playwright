# Advertising Identifier Flutter Package

The `advertising_identifier` Flutter package provides a simple way to access the advertising identifier (IDFA for iOS and GAID for Android) of a device. This identifier is crucial for mobile advertising, allowing developers to track user interactions and deliver personalized ads while respecting user privacy.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `advertising_identifier` package in scenarios such as:

- **User Tracking**: When you need to track user behavior across different sessions and devices for analytics purposes.
- **Personalized Advertising**: If your app serves ads, you can use the advertising identifier to deliver targeted advertisements based on user preferences.
- **Analytics Integration**: When integrating with third-party analytics services that require an advertising identifier for user segmentation.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API to retrieve the advertising identifier.
- **Privacy Compliance**: Adheres to privacy regulations by allowing users to opt-out of tracking.

# Tutorial: Setting Up the Advertising Identifier Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To use the `advertising_identifier` package, add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  advertising_identifier: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
   ```

2. **Enable ProGuard**: If you are using ProGuard, ensure that you add the following rules to keep the advertising identifier:

   ```pro
   -keep class com.google.android.gms.ads.identifier.** { *; }
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file located in `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

   ```xml
   <key>NSUserTrackingUsageDescription</key>
   <string>This app uses your advertising identifier for personalized ads.</string>
   ```

2. **Enable App Tracking Transparency**: Ensure that your app requests permission to track users. You can do this using the `AppTrackingTransparency` package.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s how to retrieve the advertising identifier:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:advertising_identifier/advertising_identifier.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _advertisingId = 'Unknown';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _getAdvertisingId();
  }

  Future<void> _getAdvertisingId() async {
    String advertisingId;
    try {
      advertisingId = await AdvertisingIdentifier.id;
    } catch (e) {
      advertisingId = 'Failed to get advertising ID: $e';
    }

    setState(() {
      _advertisingId = advertisingId;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Advertising Identifier Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Advertising ID: $_advertisingId'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code initializes the `RealFlutter` widget, retrieves the advertising identifier, and displays it on the screen.

# Complete Example: Advertising Identifier in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:advertising_identifier/advertising_identifier.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to hold the advertising identifier
  String _advertisingId = 'Unknown';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Call the method to get the advertising ID when the widget is initialized
    _getAdvertisingId();
  }

  // Method to retrieve the advertising identifier
  Future<void> _getAdvertisingId() async {
    String advertisingId;
    try {
      // Attempt to get the advertising ID
      advertisingId = await AdvertisingIdentifier.id;
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during the retrieval
      advertisingId = 'Failed to get advertising ID: $e';
    }

    // Update the state with the retrieved advertising ID
    setState(() {
      _advertisingId = advertisingId;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Advertising Identifier Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        // Display the advertising ID on the screen
        child: Text('Advertising ID: $_advertisingId'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    home: RealFlutter(),
  ));
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation

// The application starts by running the `main` function, which initializes the Flutter app.
// The `RealFlutter` widget is created, and its state is managed by `_RealFlutterState`.
// In the `initState` method, `_getAdvertisingId` is called to fetch the advertising identifier.
// The `_getAdvertisingId` method attempts to retrieve the advertising ID asynchronously.
// If successful, the advertising ID is stored in the `_advertisingId` variable; if it fails, an error message is stored instead.
// The `setState` method is called to update the UI with the new advertising ID.
// Finally, the advertising ID is displayed in the center of the screen within a `Text` widget.
