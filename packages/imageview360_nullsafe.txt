# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using ImageView360_NullSafe

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the `imageview360_nullsafe` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  imageview360_nullsafe: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/imageview360_nullsafe).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable the use of Swift in your project. Open your `ios/Podfile` and ensure that the platform is set to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:imageview360_nullsafe/imageview360_nullsafe.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the ImageView360 Widget
You can now use the `ImageView360` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
ImageView360(
  image: 'assets/your_360_image.jpg', // Path to your 360-degree image
  // Optional parameters
  // width: double.infinity,
  // height: 300,
  // onTap: () => print('Image tapped!'),
)
```

This widget will display the specified 360-degree image, allowing users to interact with it by swiping.

## Step 5: Running Your Application
After setting everything up, run your application using:

```bash
flutter run
```

You should now see your 360-degree image displayed and ready for interaction!

# Complete Example of Using ImageView360_NullSafe

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:imageview360_nullsafe/imageview360_nullsafe.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: '360 Image View Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('360 Image View'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ImageView360(
            image: 'assets/your_360_image.jpg', // Path to your 360-degree image
            // Optional parameters can be added here
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with MyApp().
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a title and a home property, which is a Scaffold.
// 4. The Scaffold has an AppBar with a title and a body that centers the ImageView360 widget.
// 5. The ImageView360 widget takes an image path and displays the 360-degree image, allowing user interaction.
```
