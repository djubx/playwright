# Overview of the `multiple_stream_builder` Flutter Package

The `multiple_stream_builder` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that simplifies the process of managing multiple streams of data in a single widget. This package allows you to listen to multiple streams and rebuild your UI based on the latest data from any of those streams. 

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using `multiple_stream_builder` in scenarios such as:
- **Real-time Data Updates**: When your application needs to display real-time data from multiple sources, such as chat messages, notifications, or live scores.
- **Complex UI States**: When your UI depends on various asynchronous data sources, and you want to manage their states efficiently without nesting multiple `StreamBuilder` widgets.
- **Performance Optimization**: By using this package, you can reduce the number of rebuilds in your widget tree, leading to better performance.

## Features

- **Multiple Stream Support**: Listen to multiple streams simultaneously.
- **Dynamic UI Updates**: Automatically rebuilds the UI when any of the streams emit new data.
- **Error Handling**: Provides a way to handle errors from any of the streams gracefully.
- **Loading States**: Manages loading states for each stream, allowing for a smooth user experience.

In summary, `multiple_stream_builder` is an essential package for Flutter developers looking to manage multiple streams efficiently and effectively.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `multiple_stream_builder`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `multiple_stream_builder` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  multiple_stream_builder: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

To use the `multiple_stream_builder`, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:multiple_stream_builder/multiple_stream_builder.dart';
```

### Basic Usage Example

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use `multiple_stream_builder` in your Flutter application:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:multiple_stream_builder/multiple_stream_builder.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Define your streams here
    final stream1 = Stream.periodic(Duration(seconds: 1), (count) => 'Stream 1: $count');
    final stream2 = Stream.periodic(Duration(seconds: 2), (count) => 'Stream 2: $count');

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Multiple Stream Builder Example')),
      body: MultipleStreamBuilder(
        streams: [stream1, stream2],
        builder: (context, snapshot) {
          // Check if any stream has data
          if (snapshot.hasData) {
            return Column(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              children: [
                Text(snapshot.data[0] ?? 'No data from Stream 1'),
                Text(snapshot.data[1] ?? 'No data from Stream 2'),
              ],
            );
          } else {
            return Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
          }
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create two streams that emit data at different intervals. The `MultipleStreamBuilder` listens to both streams and updates the UI accordingly.

# Complete Example of `multiple_stream_builder`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:multiple_stream_builder/multiple_stream_builder.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Multiple Stream Builder Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Define two streams that emit data at different intervals
    final stream1 = Stream.periodic(Duration(seconds: 1), (count) => 'Stream 1: $count');
    final stream2 = Stream.periodic(Duration(seconds: 2), (count) => 'Stream 2: $count');

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Multiple Stream Builder Example')),
      body: MultipleStreamBuilder(
        streams: [stream1, stream2], // Listen to both streams
        builder: (context, snapshot) {
          // Check if any stream has data
          if (snapshot.hasData) {
            return Column(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              children: [
                // Display data from the first stream
                Text(snapshot.data[0] ?? 'No data from Stream 1'),
                // Display data from the second stream
                Text(snapshot.data[1] ?? 'No data from Stream 2'),
              ],
            );
          } else {
            // Show a loading indicator while waiting for data
            return Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
          }
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. In RealFlutter, two streams are defined that emit data at different intervals.
// 4. The MultipleStreamBuilder listens to both streams and rebuilds the UI when new data is emitted.
// 5. If data is available from either stream, it displays the latest data; otherwise, it shows a loading indicator.
