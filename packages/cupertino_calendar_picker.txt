- **Date Range Selection**: Supports selecting a single date or a range of dates, making it versatile for various use cases.
- **Event Handling**: Easy to handle date selection events, allowing for responsive UI updates based on user interaction.

## When to Use
You should consider using the `cupertino_calendar_picker` package when:
- You are developing an iOS application and want to maintain a consistent design language.
- Your application requires a user-friendly way to select dates, especially for booking or scheduling functionalities.
- You need a calendar picker that can handle both single and range date selections.

In the following sections, we will walk through the setup process and provide a complete example of how to use the `cupertino_calendar_picker` package in a Flutter application.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Cupertino Calendar Picker

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the `cupertino_calendar_picker` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cupertino_calendar_picker: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration
### iOS Configuration
For iOS, ensure that your app's deployment target is set to at least iOS 10.0. You can do this by modifying the `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

### Android Configuration
For Android, no specific configuration is required for the `cupertino_calendar_picker`. However, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Using the Calendar Picker
Now that you have set up the package, you can use the `CupertinoCalendarPicker` widget in your application. Below is a simple example of how to implement it.

# Complete Example of Cupertino Calendar Picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/cupertino.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cupertino_calendar_picker/cupertino_calendar_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Cupertino Calendar Picker Demo',
      home: CalendarPickerDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class CalendarPickerDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CalendarPickerDemoState createState() => _CalendarPickerDemoState();
}

class _CalendarPickerDemoState extends State<CalendarPickerDemo> {
  DateTime? selectedDate; // Variable to hold the selected date

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Cupertino Calendar Picker'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Display the selected date
          Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
            child: Text(
              selectedDate != null
                  ? 'Selected Date: ${selectedDate!.toLocal()}'.split(' ')[0]
                  : 'No Date Selected',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
          ),
          // Cupertino Calendar Picker
          Expanded(
            child: CupertinoCalendarPicker(
              initialDateTime: DateTime.now(), // Set the initial date
              onDateTimeChanged: (DateTime newDateTime) {
                setState(() {
                  selectedDate = newDateTime; // Update the selected date
                });
              },
              // Optional: Set the minimum and maximum date range
              minimumDate: DateTime.now().subtract(Duration(days: 30)),
              maximumDate: DateTime.now().add(Duration(days: 30)),
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home page.
// 3. The CalendarPickerDemo is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the selected date.
// 4. In the build method, we create a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Column to hold the UI elements.
// 5. The selected date is displayed at the top, and the CupertinoCalendarPicker is placed below it.
// 6. When a date is selected in the calendar, the onDateTimeChanged callback is triggered, updating the selectedDate state.
// 7. The UI is rebuilt to reflect the newly selected date.
```
