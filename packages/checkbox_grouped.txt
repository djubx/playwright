# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Checkbox Grouped

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `checkbox_grouped` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  checkbox_grouped: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:checkbox_grouped/checkbox_grouped.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using Checkbox Grouped

### Basic Usage

You can create a simple checkbox group using the `CheckboxGroup` widget. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
GroupedCheckbox(
  items: ["Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3"],
  onChanged: (selectedItems) {
    print(selectedItems); // Handle the selected items
  },
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

#### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` file to include any necessary permissions, depending on your app's functionality. However, the `checkbox_grouped` package does not require any specific permissions.

## Step 4: Customizing the Checkbox Group

You can customize the appearance of the checkboxes by using various properties provided by the `GroupedCheckbox` widget. For example:

```dart
GroupedCheckbox(
  items: ["Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3"],
  onChanged: (selectedItems) {
    print(selectedItems);
  },
  activeColor: Colors.blue,
  checkColor: Colors.white,
  itemBuilder: (item) => Text(item),
)
```

This customization allows you to change the colors and the way items are displayed.

## Conclusion

With these steps, you can easily set up and use the `checkbox_grouped` package in your Flutter application. The package provides a straightforward way to manage multiple checkbox selections, enhancing the user experience.

# Complete Example of Checkbox Grouped

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:checkbox_grouped/checkbox_grouped.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Checkbox Grouped Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Checkbox Grouped Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: CheckboxGroupExample(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class CheckboxGroupExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CheckboxGroupExampleState createState() => _CheckboxGroupExampleState();
}

class _CheckboxGroupExampleState extends State<CheckboxGroupExample> {
  // List to hold selected items
  List<String> selectedItems = [];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return GroupedCheckbox(
      items: ["Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3"],
      onChanged: (List<String> selected) {
        // Update the state with selected items
        setState(() {
          selectedItems = selected;
        });
      },
      activeColor: Colors.blue, // Color when checkbox is selected
      checkColor: Colors.white, // Color of the checkmark
      itemBuilder: (item) => Text(item), // Custom item builder
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds the CheckboxGroupExample.
// 4. CheckboxGroupExample is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of selected items.
// 5. The GroupedCheckbox widget displays the checkbox options and handles changes.
// 6. When a checkbox is selected or deselected, the onChanged callback updates the selectedItems list.
// 7. The UI reflects the current selection, providing a dynamic and interactive experience for the user.
