# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Dropdown_plus

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with `dropdown_plus`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dropdown_plus: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a basic dropdown using `dropdown_plus`.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dropdown_plus/dropdown_plus.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Dropdown Plus Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: DropdownPlus<String>(
            items: ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3'],
            onChanged: (value) {
              // Handle the selected value
              print('Selected: $value');
            },
            hint: Text('Select an option'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

This code creates a simple dropdown menu with three options. When an option is selected, it prints the selected value to the console.

## Conclusion

The `dropdown_plus` package is a versatile tool for implementing dropdown menus in Flutter applications. With its rich feature set and ease of use, it can significantly enhance the user experience in your apps.

# Complete Example of Dropdown_plus

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dropdown_plus/dropdown_plus.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to hold the selected value
  String? selectedValue;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Dropdown Plus Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: DropdownPlus<String>(
            // List of items to display in the dropdown
            items: ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3'],
            // Callback function when an item is selected
            onChanged: (value) {
              setState(() {
                selectedValue = value; // Update the selected value
              });
              // Print the selected value to the console
              print('Selected: $value');
            },
            // Displayed when no item is selected
            hint: Text('Select an option'),
            // Display the selected value
            value: selectedValue,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatefulWidget, allowing it to maintain the state of the selected dropdown value.
// 3. In the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a DropdownPlus widget is instantiated with a list of options.
// 5. The onChanged callback updates the selected value and prints it to the console whenever a new option is selected.
// 6. The hint text is displayed when no option is selected, and the selected value is shown once an option is chosen.
