# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the QR Code Dart Scan Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `qr_code_dart_scan` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  qr_code_dart_scan: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add camera permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request camera access:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to scan QR codes.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to implement QR code scanning.

# Complete Example: QR Code Scanner in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:qr_code_dart_scan/qr_code_dart_scan.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'QR Code Scanner',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: QRScannerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class QRScannerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _QRScannerScreenState createState() => _QRScannerScreenState();
}

class _QRScannerScreenState extends State<QRScannerScreen> {
  String result = "Scan a QR code";

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('QR Code Scanner'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(result), // Display the scanned result
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () async {
                // Start the QR code scanning process
                String scannedResult = await QRCodeDartScan.scan();
                setState(() {
                  result = scannedResult; // Update the result with the scanned value
                });
              },
              child: Text('Start Scanning'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```
// The above code implements a simple QR code scanner in Flutter.
// 
// 1. The `main` function initializes the app by running the `RealFlutter` widget.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` class sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The `QRScannerScreen` widget is the main screen where the QR code scanning takes place.
// 4. Inside the `QRScannerScreen`, we have a stateful widget that maintains the scanned result.
// 5. The `build` method creates a simple UI with a text display for the scanned result and a button to start scanning.
// 6. When the button is pressed, it calls the `QRCodeDartScan.scan()` method to initiate the scanning process.
// 7. The scanned result is then displayed on the screen by updating the state with `setState()`.
// 
// This application flow allows users to easily scan QR codes and see the results in real-time.
