# Overview of the "osc" Flutter Package

The "osc" package in Flutter is designed for developers who need to implement Open Sound Control (OSC) communication in their applications. OSC is a protocol used for communication among computers, sound synthesizers, and other multimedia devices. This package allows Flutter applications to send and receive OSC messages over UDP, making it ideal for real-time audio and multimedia applications.

## When to Use "osc"

You might consider using the "osc" package in scenarios such as:
- Building a music application that communicates with synthesizers or other audio devices.
- Creating interactive installations that require real-time data exchange.
- Developing applications that need to control multimedia devices remotely.

## Key Features

- **UDP Communication**: The package supports sending and receiving OSC messages over UDP, which is essential for low-latency applications.
- **Message Formatting**: It provides utilities to format OSC messages easily, including support for various data types.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: The package is designed to work seamlessly with Dart's asynchronous programming model, allowing for non-blocking operations.

# Setting Up and Using the "osc" Package

## Installation

To use the "osc" package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  osc: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to access the internet. Add the following line inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to configure your app's `Info.plist` to allow network connections. Add the following key-value pair:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage

To use the "osc" package, you will typically create an instance of the `OscSender` or `OscReceiver` class, depending on whether you want to send or receive messages.

### Sending OSC Messages

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to send an OSC message:

```dart
import 'package:osc/osc.dart';

void sendOscMessage() {
  // Create an instance of OscSender
  final sender = OscSender('192.168.1.100', 8000); // IP and port of the receiver

  // Create an OSC message
  final message = OscMessage('/example', [1, 2, 3]);

  // Send the message
  sender.send(message);
}
```

### Receiving OSC Messages

To receive OSC messages, you can set up an `OscReceiver`:

```dart
import 'package:osc/osc.dart';

void startOscReceiver() {
  // Create an instance of OscReceiver
  final receiver = OscReceiver(8000); // Port to listen on

  // Start listening for messages
  receiver.listen((message) {
    print('Received message: ${message.address} with arguments: ${message.arguments}');
  });
}
```

With these examples, you can start sending and receiving OSC messages in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using the "osc" Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:osc/osc.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late OscSender sender;
  late OscReceiver receiver;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the OSC sender with the receiver's IP and port
    sender = OscSender('192.168.1.100', 8000);
    // Initialize the OSC receiver on port 8000
    receiver = OscReceiver(8000);
    // Start listening for incoming OSC messages
    receiver.listen((message) {
      // Print the received message to the console
      print('Received message: ${message.address} with arguments: ${message.arguments}');
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the sender and receiver when the widget is removed
    sender.close();
    receiver.close();
    super.dispose();
  }

  void sendMessage() {
    // Create an OSC message with an address and arguments
    final message = OscMessage('/example', ['Hello, OSC!']);
    // Send the message using the sender
    sender.send(message);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('OSC Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: sendMessage, // Send OSC message on button press
            child: Text('Send OSC Message'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```
// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the initState method, we initialize the OscSender and OscReceiver.
// 3. The sender is configured to send messages to a specific IP address and port.
// 4. The receiver listens for incoming OSC messages on port 8000.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the sendMessage method is called.
// 6. This method creates an OSC message with a specific address and sends it using the sender.
// 7. Any received messages are printed to the console.
// 8. When the widget is disposed, both the sender and receiver are closed to free up resources.
