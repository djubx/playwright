Here's a detailed technical blog on the "validated" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Validated Flutter Package

The **validated** Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to simplify form validation in Flutter applications. It provides a robust framework for validating user input, ensuring that data entered into forms meets specific criteria before submission. This package is particularly useful in applications that require user authentication, data entry, or any scenario where input validation is critical.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the validated package in scenarios such as:
- User registration and login forms where email and password validation is necessary.
- Data entry forms that require specific formats, such as phone numbers or dates.
- Any application that needs to ensure data integrity before processing user input.

## Features

- **Custom Validators**: Create your own validation rules to meet specific requirements.
- **Built-in Validators**: Use pre-defined validators for common use cases like email, URL, and numeric validation.
- **Error Handling**: Easily manage and display error messages to users.
- **Integration with Flutter Forms**: Seamlessly integrate with Flutter's form widgets for a smooth user experience.

By leveraging the validated package, developers can enhance the reliability and user-friendliness of their applications, ensuring that users provide valid input before proceeding.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Validated Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the validated package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  validated: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Validated Package

Hereâ€™s how to use the validated package in your Flutter application:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:validated/validated.dart';
```

2. Create a form using `ValidatedForm` and define your fields with validation rules:

```dart
ValidatedForm(
  child: Column(
    children: [
      ValidatedTextField(
        validator: (value) => value.isEmpty ? 'Please enter your name' : null,
        decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Name'),
      ),
      ValidatedTextField(
        validator: (value) => !isEmail(value) ? 'Invalid email' : null,
        decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Email'),
      ),
      // Add more fields as needed
    ],
  ),
);
```

3. Handle form submission and validation:

```dart
void _submitForm() {
  if (_formKey.currentState.validate()) {
    // Process data
  }
}
```

By following these steps, you can effectively implement form validation in your Flutter application using the validated package.

# Complete Example of Using the Validated Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:validated/validated.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Validated Package Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Validated Package Example'),
        ),
        body: MyForm(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MyForm extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyFormState createState() => _MyFormState();
}

class _MyFormState extends State<MyForm> {
  final _formKey = GlobalKey<FormState>(); // Key to identify the form

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
      child: ValidatedForm(
        key: _formKey, // Assign the form key
        child: Column(
          children: [
            ValidatedTextField(
              validator: (value) => value.isEmpty ? 'Please enter your name' : null,
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Name'),
            ),
            ValidatedTextField(
              validator: (value) => !isEmail(value) ? 'Invalid email' : null,
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Email'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _submitForm, // Call the submit function
              child: Text('Submit'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void _submitForm() {
    if (_formKey.currentState.validate()) {
      // If the form is valid, display a snackbar
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Processing Data')),
      );
      // Here you can process the data
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets up the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home scaffold containing an AppBar and the MyForm widget.
// 3. MyForm is a stateful widget that contains a form with validated text fields for name and email.
// 4. Each text field has a validator that checks for empty input or invalid email format.
// 5. When the submit button is pressed, the _submitForm method is called.
// 6. If the form is valid, a snackbar is displayed indicating that data is being processed.
```

In this blog, we explored the validated Flutter package, detailing its features, setup process, and a complete example. The application flow is straightforward, ensuring that user input is validated effectively before any processing occurs. This enhances the overall user experience and data integrity in your Flutter applications.
