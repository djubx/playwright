# Tutorial: Setting Up the Onboarding Screen Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `onboarding_screen` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `onboarding_screen` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  onboarding_screen: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install Packages

Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your `ios/Podfile` has the platform set to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:onboarding_screen/onboarding_screen.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Onboarding Screen

You can now use the `OnboardingScreen` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
OnboardingScreen(
  pages: [
    PageModel(
      title: "Welcome",
      body: "This is the first page of the onboarding process.",
      image: Image.asset("assets/welcome.png"),
    ),
    PageModel(
      title: "Features",
      body: "Learn about the features of our app.",
      image: Image.asset("assets/features.png"),
    ),
    PageModel(
      title: "Get Started",
      body: "Let's get started with your journey!",
      image: Image.asset("assets/get_started.png"),
    ),
  ],
  onDone: () {
    // Navigate to the home screen
  },
  onSkip: () {
    // Navigate to the home screen
  },
);
```

## Step 6: Customization

You can customize the appearance of the onboarding screens by modifying the properties of the `OnboardingScreen` widget, such as background color, button styles, and more.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the `onboarding_screen` package in your Flutter application effectively.

# Complete Example of Onboarding Screen

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:onboarding_screen/onboarding_screen.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Onboarding Example',
      home: OnboardingExample(),
    );
  }
}

class OnboardingExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return OnboardingScreen(
      pages: [
        PageModel(
          title: "Welcome",
          body: "This is the first page of the onboarding process.",
          image: Image.asset("assets/welcome.png"),
        ),
        PageModel(
          title: "Features",
          body: "Learn about the features of our app.",
          image: Image.asset("assets/features.png"),
        ),
        PageModel(
          title: "Get Started",
          body: "Let's get started with your journey!",
          image: Image.asset("assets/get_started.png"),
        ),
      ],
      onDone: () {
        // Navigate to the home screen
        Navigator.of(context).pushReplacement(
          MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => HomeScreen()),
        );
      },
      onSkip: () {
        // Navigate to the home screen
        Navigator.of(context).pushReplacement(
          MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => HomeScreen()),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Home")),
      body: Center(child: Text("Welcome to the Home Screen!")),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets OnboardingExample as the home widget.
// 3. OnboardingExample creates an OnboardingScreen with three pages, each containing a title, body, and image.
// 4. The onDone and onSkip callbacks navigate to the HomeScreen when the user completes or skips the onboarding process.
// 5. HomeScreen displays a simple message indicating that the user has reached the home screen.
```
