# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Heart BPM Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **heart_bpm** package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **heart_bpm** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  heart_bpm: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open the `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open the `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following keys to request permission for Bluetooth access:

```xml
<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires Bluetooth access to monitor heart rate.</string>
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires location access to connect to heart rate devices.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement heart rate monitoring.

# Complete Example: Heart Rate Monitoring Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:heart_bpm/heart_bpm.dart'; // Import the heart_bpm package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  HeartBpm _heartBpm = HeartBpm(); // Create an instance of HeartBpm
  String _heartRate = "Unknown"; // Variable to store heart rate

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _startHeartRateMonitoring(); // Start monitoring heart rate
  }

  // Function to start heart rate monitoring
  void _startHeartRateMonitoring() async {
    // Check if the heart rate sensor is available
    bool isAvailable = await _heartBpm.isSensorAvailable();
    if (isAvailable) {
      // Start listening to heart rate updates
      _heartBpm.onHeartRateChanged.listen((heartRate) {
        setState(() {
          _heartRate = heartRate.toString(); // Update heart rate variable
        });
      });
    } else {
      // Handle the case where the sensor is not available
      setState(() {
        _heartRate = "Sensor not available"; // Update UI accordingly
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Heart Rate Monitor'), // App title
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(
            'Current Heart Rate: $_heartRate BPM', // Display heart rate
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _heartBpm.dispose(); // Dispose of the heartBpm instance
    super.dispose();
  }
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation

// The application starts by running the `RealFlutter` widget.
// In the `initState` method, we call `_startHeartRateMonitoring` to begin monitoring.
// We check if the heart rate sensor is available using `isSensorAvailable()`.
// If available, we listen for heart rate changes using `onHeartRateChanged`.
// When a new heart rate value is received, we update the `_heartRate` variable and refresh the UI.
// If the sensor is not available, we update the UI to inform the user.
// The heart rate is displayed in the center of the screen.
// Finally, we ensure to dispose of the `_heartBpm` instance when the widget is removed from the widget tree to free up resources.
