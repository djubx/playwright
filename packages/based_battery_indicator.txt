# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Based Battery Indicator Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `based_battery_indicator` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  based_battery_indicator: ^1.0.0
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file. Add the following permission:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BATTERY_STATS"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to add the following key to your `Info.plist` file to request permission for battery usage:

```xml
<key>NSBatteryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to battery information.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the battery indicator in your app.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:based_battery_indicator/based_battery_indicator.dart';
```

2. Use the `RealFlutter` class to create a widget that displays the battery status:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Battery Indicator Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: BatteryIndicator(
          // Customize the appearance
          width: 200,
          height: 100,
          style: BatteryIndicatorStyle(
            backgroundColor: Colors.grey,
            chargingColor: Colors.green,
            dischargingColor: Colors.red,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Finally, run your application to see the battery indicator in action!

With these steps, you have successfully integrated the `based_battery_indicator` package into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using Based Battery Indicator

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:based_battery_indicator/based_battery_indicator.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Battery Indicator Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(), // Main widget for the app
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Battery Indicator Example'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: BatteryIndicator(
          // Displaying the battery indicator
          width: 200, // Width of the battery indicator
          height: 100, // Height of the battery indicator
          style: BatteryIndicatorStyle(
            backgroundColor: Colors.grey, // Background color
            chargingColor: Colors.green, // Color when charging
            dischargingColor: Colors.red, // Color when discharging
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to RealFlutter, which is the main widget.
// 4. RealFlutter builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a BatteryIndicator is created with specified dimensions and styles.
// 6. The BatteryIndicator automatically updates to show the current battery level and charging status.
