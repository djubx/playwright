# Tutorial: Setting Up the Paytm Flutter Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the Paytm Flutter package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the Paytm package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  paytm: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions and activities:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>

<application>
    ...
    <activity android:name="com.paytm.pgsdk.PaytmPaymentActivity" />
</application>
```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure that your `android/build.gradle` file includes the necessary repositories:

```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. **CocoaPods**: Ensure you have the latest version of CocoaPods installed. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pod install
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to initiate a payment.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:paytm/paytm.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Paytm Payment Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              initiatePayment();
            },
            child: Text('Pay Now'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void initiatePayment() {
    // Create a payment request
    PaytmPaymentRequest request = PaytmPaymentRequest(
      orderId: 'ORDER123',
      customerId: 'CUSTOMER123',
      amount: '10.00',
      callbackUrl: 'https://your.callback.url',
      mid: 'YOUR_MID',
      txnToken: 'YOUR_TXN_TOKEN',
    );

    // Start the payment process
    PaytmPayment.startPayment(request).then((response) {
      // Handle the payment response
      if (response['STATUS'] == 'TXN_SUCCESS') {
        print('Payment Successful');
      } else {
        print('Payment Failed');
      }
    });
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with a button that initiates a payment when pressed. The `initiatePayment` function constructs a payment request and starts the payment process.

# Complete Example of Paytm Flutter Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:paytm/paytm.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Paytm Payment Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              initiatePayment(); // Call the payment initiation function
            },
            child: Text('Pay Now'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void initiatePayment() {
    // Create a payment request with necessary details
    PaytmPaymentRequest request = PaytmPaymentRequest(
      orderId: 'ORDER123', // Unique order ID
      customerId: 'CUSTOMER123', // Unique customer ID
      amount: '10.00', // Amount to be paid
      callbackUrl: 'https://your.callback.url', // Callback URL for payment status
      mid: 'YOUR_MID', // Merchant ID
      txnToken: 'YOUR_TXN_TOKEN', // Transaction token
    );

    // Start the payment process
    PaytmPayment.startPayment(request).then((response) {
      // Handle the payment response
      if (response['STATUS'] == 'TXN_SUCCESS') {
        print('Payment Successful'); // Log success message
      } else {
        print('Payment Failed'); // Log failure message
      }
    });
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with a MaterialApp containing a Scaffold.
// 2. An AppBar is displayed with the title 'Paytm Payment Example'.
// 3. The body contains a centered button labeled 'Pay Now'.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the initiatePayment function is called.
// 5. Inside initiatePayment, a PaytmPaymentRequest is created with required details.
// 6. The payment process is initiated using PaytmPayment.startPayment.
// 7. The response is handled to check if the payment was successful or failed, and appropriate messages are logged.
```
