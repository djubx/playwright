# Tutorial

## Setup Process

To get started with the `appbar_animated` package, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `appbar_animated` package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     appbar_animated: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
   ```

2. **Install the Package**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

     ```groovy
     android {
         ...
         defaultConfig {
             ...
             minSdkVersion 21
         }
     }
     ```

   - **iOS**: Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and ensure you have the necessary permissions and configurations set up for your app.

4. **Import the Package**: In your Dart files where you want to use the animated app bar, import the package:

   ```dart
   import 'package:appbar_animated/appbar_animated.dart';
   ```

## Using the Package

To use the `appbar_animated` package, you can follow this simple example:

1. **Create a Stateful Widget**: The animated app bar requires a stateful widget to manage the scroll position.

2. **Implement the Animated App Bar**: Use the `AppBarAnimated` widget provided by the package.

Hereâ€™s a basic implementation:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:appbar_animated/appbar_animated.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // ScrollController to manage the scroll position
  final ScrollController _scrollController = ScrollController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      // Using AppBarAnimated for the app bar
      appBar: AppBarAnimated(
        controller: _scrollController,
        title: Text('Animated App Bar'),
      ),
      body: ListView.builder(
        controller: _scrollController,
        itemCount: 50, // Number of items in the list
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return ListTile(
            title: Text('Item $index'),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application with an animated app bar that responds to scrolling.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:appbar_animated/appbar_animated.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // ScrollController to manage the scroll position
  final ScrollController _scrollController = ScrollController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      // Using AppBarAnimated for the app bar
      appBar: AppBarAnimated(
        controller: _scrollController,
        title: Text('Animated App Bar'),
      ),
      body: ListView.builder(
        controller: _scrollController,
        itemCount: 50, // Number of items in the list
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return ListTile(
            title: Text('Item $index'),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The RealFlutter class is a StatefulWidget that manages the state of the app.
// 2. A ScrollController is created to control the scrolling of the ListView.
// 3. The AppBarAnimated widget is used as the app bar, which takes the ScrollController as a parameter.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a ListView.builder that generates a list of items.
// 5. As the user scrolls through the list, the app bar animates based on the scroll position, providing a dynamic user experience.
```
