# Upgrade Flutter Package: A Comprehensive Overview

The **upgrade** Flutter package is designed to facilitate the management of app upgrades in a seamless manner. It allows developers to check for updates, prompt users to upgrade, and handle the upgrade process efficiently. This package is particularly useful for applications that require regular updates to enhance features, fix bugs, or improve performance.

## When to Use the Upgrade Package
- **Regular App Updates**: If your app frequently receives updates, this package can help manage the upgrade process smoothly.
- **User Engagement**: Prompting users to upgrade can enhance user engagement and ensure they are using the latest features.
- **Critical Bug Fixes**: In cases where critical bugs are fixed in new versions, this package can ensure users are notified and encouraged to upgrade.

## Key Features
- **Version Checking**: Automatically checks for the latest version of the app.
- **User Prompts**: Provides customizable prompts to encourage users to upgrade.
- **Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API for integrating upgrade checks into your Flutter application.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Upgrade Package

## Installation
To get started with the upgrade package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  upgrade: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/upgrade).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the internet:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to allow your app to access the internet:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the upgrade package, you can follow these steps in your Flutter application:

1. Import the package:

```dart
import 'package:upgrade/upgrade.dart';
```

2. Create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class and implement the upgrade check:

```dart
class RealFlutter {
  void checkForUpdate() async {
    final result = await Upgrade.checkForUpdate();
    if (result.hasUpdate) {
      // Prompt user to upgrade
      Upgrade.promptUpgrade();
    }
  }
}
```

3. Call the `checkForUpdate` method at an appropriate time, such as during app startup or when the user navigates to a specific screen.

# Complete Example: Implementing the Upgrade Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:upgrade/upgrade.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Upgrade Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Check for updates when the app starts
    checkForUpdate();
  }

  void checkForUpdate() async {
    // Check if there is an update available
    final result = await Upgrade.checkForUpdate();
    if (result.hasUpdate) {
      // If an update is available, prompt the user
      Upgrade.promptUpgrade();
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Upgrade Package Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to the Upgrade Example App!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and the main function runs, initializing the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. In the RealFlutter widget, the initState method is called, which triggers the checkForUpdate method.
// 4. The checkForUpdate method uses the Upgrade package to check if an update is available.
// 5. If an update is found, the user is prompted to upgrade.
// 6. The UI displays a simple welcome message to the user.
