# Complete Example of flutter_install_app

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_install_app/flutter_install_app.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Install App Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Install App Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // URL of the app to install
              String appUrl = 'https://example.com/path/to/your/app.apk';
              installApp(appUrl);
            },
            child: Text('Install App'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to initiate app installation
  void installApp(String appUrl) async {
    try {
      // Attempt to install the app from the provided URL
      await FlutterInstallApp.install(appUrl);
      // Notify user of success
      print("Installation started successfully.");
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle installation error
      print("Installation failed: $e");
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a simple UI.
// 3. The UI consists of a button that, when pressed, triggers the installApp function.
// 4. The installApp function attempts to install the app from the specified URL.
// 5. If the installation is successful, a success message is printed; otherwise, an error message is displayed.
