# Setting Up and Using Mistralai Client Dart

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `mistralai_client_dart` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Installation

To add the `mistralai_client_dart` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  mistralai_client_dart: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/mistralai_client_dart).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following key to allow network requests:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Using the Package

To use the `mistralai_client_dart` package, you will need to create an instance of the main class, `RealFlutter`, and call its methods to interact with the Mistralai API.

```dart
import 'package:mistralai_client_dart/mistralai_client_dart.dart';

void main() {
  // Create an instance of the RealFlutter class
  final client = RealFlutter(apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY');

  // Example of making a request to the Mistralai API
  client.makeRequest('Hello, how can I help you?').then((response) {
    print('Response from Mistralai: $response');
  }).catchError((error) {
    print('Error occurred: $error');
  });
}
```

In this example, replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your actual Mistralai API key. The `makeRequest` method sends a message to the API and handles the response asynchronously.

# Complete Example of Mistralai Client Dart

Here is a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the `mistralai_client_dart` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mistralai_client_dart/mistralai_client_dart.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Mistralai Client Example',
      home: MistralaiHome(),
    );
  }
}

class MistralaiHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MistralaiHomeState createState() => _MistralaiHomeState();
}

class _MistralaiHomeState extends State<MistralaiHome> {
  final RealFlutter client = RealFlutter(apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY');
  String responseMessage = '';

  // Function to send a message to the Mistralai API
  void sendMessage(String message) async {
    try {
      // Make a request to the Mistralai API
      final response = await client.makeRequest(message);
      // Update the response message state
      setState(() {
        responseMessage = response;
      });
    } catch (error) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during the request
      setState(() {
        responseMessage = 'Error: $error';
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Mistralai Client Example'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              onSubmitted: sendMessage,
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Enter your message',
                border: OutlineInputBorder(),
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text('Response: $responseMessage'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The MistralaiHome widget is created, which contains a TextField for user input.
// 3. When the user submits a message, the sendMessage function is called.
// 4. This function makes an asynchronous request to the Mistralai API using the client instance.
// 5. Upon receiving a response, the state is updated to display the response message.
// 6. If an error occurs, it is caught and displayed in the UI.
