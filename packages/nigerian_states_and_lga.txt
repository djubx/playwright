# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Nigerian States and LGA Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `nigerian_states_and_lga` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  nigerian_states_and_lga: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:nigerian_states_and_lga/nigerian_states_and_lga.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` if your app requires location services. However, for basic usage of the package, no additional configuration is necessary.

## Step 4: Fetching States and LGAs

You can now use the package to fetch states and their corresponding LGAs. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to do this:

```dart
void main() {
  // Fetch all states
  List<StateModel> states = NigerianStates.getAllStates();

  // Fetch LGAs for a specific state
  List<LGA> lgas = NigerianStates.getLGAs('Lagos');
}
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to retrieve all states and the LGAs for a specific state (in this case, Lagos).

# Complete Example: Flutter Application Using Nigerian States and LGA Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:nigerian_states_and_lga/nigerian_states_and_lga.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Nigerian States and LGA Demo',
      home: StateSelectionScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class StateSelectionScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _StateSelectionScreenState createState() => _StateSelectionScreenState();
}

class _StateSelectionScreenState extends State<StateSelectionScreen> {
  List<StateModel> states = [];
  List<LGA> lgas = [];
  String? selectedState;
  String? selectedLGA;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Fetch all states when the widget is initialized
    states = NigerianStates.getAllStates();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Select State and LGA'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            DropdownButton<String>(
              hint: Text('Select State'),
              value: selectedState,
              onChanged: (String? newValue) {
                setState(() {
                  selectedState = newValue;
                  // Fetch LGAs for the selected state
                  lgas = NigerianStates.getLGAs(selectedState!);
                  selectedLGA = null; // Reset selected LGA
                });
              },
              items: states.map((StateModel state) {
                return DropdownMenuItem<String>(
                  value: state.name,
                  child: Text(state.name),
                );
              }).toList(),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            DropdownButton<String>(
              hint: Text('Select LGA'),
              value: selectedLGA,
              onChanged: (String? newValue) {
                setState(() {
                  selectedLGA = newValue;
                });
              },
              items: lgas.map((LGA lga) {
                return DropdownMenuItem<String>(
                  value: lga.name,
                  child: Text(lga.name),
                );
              }).toList(),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Display selected state and LGA
                showDialog(
                  context: context,
                  builder: (context) {
                    return AlertDialog(
                      title: Text('Selected Location'),
                      content: Text('State: $selectedState\nLGA: $selectedLGA'),
                      actions: [
                        TextButton(
                          onPressed: () {
                            Navigator.of(context).pop();
                          },
                          child: Text('OK'),
                        ),
                      ],
                    );
                  },
                );
              },
              child: Text('Submit'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The StateSelectionScreen is displayed, where users can select a state and LGA.
// 3. On initialization, all states are fetched and displayed in a dropdown.
// 4. When a state is selected, the corresponding LGAs are fetched and displayed in another dropdown.
// 5. The user can select an LGA and click the Submit button to see their selection in a dialog.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, the application allows users to select a state and its corresponding LGA from dropdown menus. The flow of the application is straightforward: it initializes by fetching all states, updates the LGAs based on the selected state, and displays the selected options in a dialog when the user submits their choice. This demonstrates the core functionality of the `nigerian_states_and_lga` package effectively.
