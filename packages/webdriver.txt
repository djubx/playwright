# Webdriver Flutter Package
================================

The `webdriver` package in Flutter allows you to automate interactions with web browsers. It provides a programmatic way to simulate user interactions, making it useful for tasks such as web scraping, automation testing, and more.

## When to Use

*   Automating web interactions for testing or scraping purposes
*   Simulating user interactions for demonstrations or tutorials
*   Automating repetitive tasks on websites

## Features

*   Supports multiple browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)
*   Allows for navigation, clicking, typing, and other interactions
*   Can handle alerts, prompts, and confirmations
*   Supports both Android and iOS platforms

# Tutorial
==========

## Setup

1.  Add the `webdriver` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

    ```yml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  webdriver: ^2.1.0
```

2.  Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Android Setup

1.  Add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

    ```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

## iOS Setup

1.  Add the following lines to your `Info.plist` file:

    ```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage

1.  Import the `webdriver` package:

    ```dart
import 'package:webdriver/webdriver.dart';
```

2.  Create a new instance of the `WebDriver` class:

    ```dart
final driver = await WebDriver.create(
  browser: Browser.chrome,
  platform: Platform.android,
);
```

3.  Navigate to a webpage:

    ```dart
await driver.get('https://www.example.com');
```

4.  Find an element and click on it:

    ```dart
final element = await driver.findElement(By.cssSelector('button'));
await element.click();
```

5.  Close the browser:

    ```dart
await driver.quit();
```

<-- START_MAIN -->

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:webdriver/webdriver.dart';

void main() async {
  // Create a new instance of the WebDriver class
  final driver = await WebDriver.create(
    browser: Browser.chrome,
    platform: Platform.android,
  );

  // Navigate to a webpage
  await driver.get('https://www.example.com');

  // Find an element and click on it
  final element = await driver.findElement(By.cssSelector('button'));
  await element.click();

  // Wait for 5 seconds
  await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 5));

  // Close the browser
  await driver.quit();
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The WebDriver class is created with the specified browser and platform.
// 2. The get method is called to navigate to the specified webpage.
// 3. The findElement method is called to find an element on the webpage.
// 4. The click method is called to simulate a click on the element.
// 5. The Future.delayed method is called to wait for 5 seconds.
// 6. The quit method is called to close the browser.

// In summary, this code creates a new instance of the WebDriver class, navigates to a webpage, finds an element, clicks on it, waits for 5 seconds, and then closes the browser.
