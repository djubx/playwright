# Setting Up and Using `vania_cli`

## Installation

To get started with the `vania_cli` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  vania_cli: ^1.0.0
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your project is set up to allow command-line tools. You may need to configure your `android/app/build.gradle` file to include any necessary permissions or dependencies required by the CLI commands.

### iOS

For iOS, make sure you have the necessary permissions set in your `Info.plist` file if your commands require access to device features or files.

## Using `vania_cli`

Once installed, you can start using `vania_cli` from the command line. Here are some common commands:

- **Create a New Project**:
  ```bash
  flutter pub run vania_cli create my_new_project
  ```

- **Generate Code**:
  ```bash
  flutter pub run vania_cli generate model User
  ```

- **Manage Assets**:
  ```bash
  flutter pub run vania_cli assets add path/to/asset
  ```

These commands will help you automate various tasks and improve your development efficiency.

# Complete Example of Using `vania_cli`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:vania_cli/vania_cli.dart'; // Importing the vania_cli package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the main application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Vania CLI Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(), // Setting the home screen
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Vania CLI Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Triggering a CLI command to generate a model
            generateModel();
          },
          child: Text('Generate User Model'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void generateModel() {
    // Using the vania_cli package to generate a model
    final result = VaniaCli.generate('model', 'User');
    // Displaying the result of the command
    print(result);
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is set as the home of the app, which contains an AppBar and a button.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the generateModel function is called.
// 5. The generateModel function uses the VaniaCli class to execute a command that generates a User model.
// 6. The result of the command is printed to the console, allowing developers to see the output of the CLI command.
