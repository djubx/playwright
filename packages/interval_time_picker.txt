# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Interval Time Picker

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `interval_time_picker` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  interval_time_picker: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` file to include permissions if your app requires them. However, the `interval_time_picker` does not require any specific permissions.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `IntervalTimePicker` in your app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:interval_time_picker/interval_time_picker.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Interval Time Picker Example',
      home: TimePickerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class TimePickerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _TimePickerScreenState createState() => _TimePickerScreenState();
}

class _TimePickerScreenState extends State<TimePickerScreen> {
  TimeOfDay? selectedTime;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Select Time Interval'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text(
              selectedTime != null
                  ? 'Selected Time: ${selectedTime!.hour}:${selectedTime!.minute}'
                  : 'No Time Selected',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () async {
                // Show the interval time picker
                final TimeOfDay? time = await showIntervalTimePicker(
                  context: context,
                  initialTime: TimeOfDay.now(),
                  interval: Duration(minutes: 15), // Set interval to 15 minutes
                );
                // Update the selected time
                if (time != null) {
                  setState(() {
                    selectedTime = time;
                  });
                }
              },
              child: Text('Pick Time Interval'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that allows users to select a time interval. The selected time is displayed on the screen.

# Complete Example of Interval Time Picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:interval_time_picker/interval_time_picker.dart';

// Main entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Main application class
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Interval Time Picker Example',
      home: TimePickerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

// Screen that contains the time picker
class TimePickerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _TimePickerScreenState createState() => _TimePickerScreenState();
}

// State class for TimePickerScreen
class _TimePickerScreenState extends State<TimePickerScreen> {
  TimeOfDay? selectedTime; // Variable to hold the selected time

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Select Time Interval'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the selected time or a message if none is selected
            Text(
              selectedTime != null
                  ? 'Selected Time: ${selectedTime!.hour}:${selectedTime!.minute}'
                  : 'No Time Selected',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between elements
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () async {
                // Show the interval time picker
                final TimeOfDay? time = await showIntervalTimePicker(
                  context: context,
                  initialTime: TimeOfDay.now(), // Set initial time to now
                  interval: Duration(minutes: 15), // Set interval to 15 minutes
                );
                // Update the selected time if a time was picked
                if (time != null) {
                  setState(() {
                    selectedTime = time; // Update the state with the selected time
                  });
                }
              },
              child: Text('Pick Time Interval'), // Button text
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main() function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (TimePickerScreen).
// 3. TimePickerScreen is a stateful widget that maintains the selected time.
// 4. The build method displays the selected time or a message if none is selected.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the interval time picker is shown.
// 6. The user can select a time, and if a time is selected, it updates the state to display the selected time.
