- **Buttons**: Adding inner shadows to buttons can create a pressed effect, making them appear more interactive.
- **Containers**: For any container that requires a subtle depth effect, inner shadows can enhance the visual hierarchy.

## Features

- **Customizable Shadow Properties**: You can adjust the color, blur radius, and offset of the inner shadow to fit your design needs.
- **Easy Integration**: The package is straightforward to integrate into existing Flutter projects.
- **Performance**: Designed to be lightweight, ensuring that it does not significantly impact the performance of your application.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_inner_shadow

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `flutter_inner_shadow` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_inner_shadow: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the inner shadow effect, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_inner_shadow/flutter_inner_shadow.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Inner Shadow Widget

You can now use the `InnerShadow` widget provided by the package. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
InnerShadow(
  shadowColor: Colors.black.withOpacity(0.5), // Color of the shadow
  offset: Offset(5, 5), // Offset of the shadow
  blur: 10, // Blur radius
  child: Container(
    width: 200,
    height: 100,
    color: Colors.white, // Background color of the container
    child: Center(child: Text('Inner Shadow Example')),
  ),
)
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Optimizations

To optimize performance, especially when using multiple inner shadows, consider:
- Reducing the blur radius if possible.
- Using inner shadows sparingly to avoid overwhelming the user interface.

By following these steps, you can successfully integrate and utilize the `flutter_inner_shadow` package in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of flutter_inner_shadow

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_inner_shadow/flutter_inner_shadow.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Inner Shadow Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Inner Shadow Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: InnerShadow(
            shadowColor: Colors.black.withOpacity(0.5), // Set shadow color
            offset: Offset(5, 5), // Set shadow offset
            blur: 10, // Set blur radius
            child: Container(
              width: 200, // Width of the container
              height: 100, // Height of the container
              color: Colors.white, // Background color of the container
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'Inner Shadow Example', // Text inside the container
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20), // Text style
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Inner Shadow Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers an InnerShadow widget.
// 5. The InnerShadow widget applies a shadow effect to its child, which is a Container.
// 6. The Container has a fixed width and height, a white background, and contains centered text.
// 7. The shadow properties (color, offset, blur) can be adjusted to achieve the desired effect.
```
