- **Filter Options**: For filtering lists or data based on user selection.
- **Settings**: To allow users to toggle between different settings or modes.

## Key Features
- **Customizable Appearance**: You can easily customize the colors, shapes, and styles of the segments.
- **Responsive Design**: The segments adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the segment_bar Package

## Installation
To use the `segment_bar` package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  segment_bar: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/segment_bar).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the `segment_bar` in your Flutter application:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:segment_bar/segment_bar.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  int _selectedIndex = 0; // Track the selected index

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Segment Bar Example')),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          SegmentBar(
            items: [
              SegmentBarItem(text: 'Option 1'),
              SegmentBarItem(text: 'Option 2'),
              SegmentBarItem(text: 'Option 3'),
            ],
            selectedIndex: _selectedIndex,
            onValueChanged: (index) {
              setState(() {
                _selectedIndex = index; // Update the selected index
              });
            },
          ),
          // Display the selected option
          Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
            child: Text('Selected: Option ${_selectedIndex + 1}'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple app with a segment bar that allows users to select between three options. The selected option is displayed below the segment bar.

# Complete Example of Using segment_bar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:segment_bar/segment_bar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  int _selectedIndex = 0; // Variable to track the selected index

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Segment Bar Example')),
        body: Column(
          children: [
            // Segment bar widget
            SegmentBar(
              items: [
                SegmentBarItem(text: 'Option 1'), // First option
                SegmentBarItem(text: 'Option 2'), // Second option
                SegmentBarItem(text: 'Option 3'), // Third option
              ],
              selectedIndex: _selectedIndex, // Current selected index
              onValueChanged: (index) {
                setState(() {
                  _selectedIndex = index; // Update the selected index on change
                });
              },
            ),
            // Display the currently selected option
            Padding(
              padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
              child: Text('Selected: Option ${_selectedIndex + 1}'), // Show selected option
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the selected index.
// 3. The SegmentBar widget is created with three options.
// 4. When a user taps on a segment, the onValueChanged callback is triggered, updating the selected index.
// 5. The selected index is displayed below the segment bar, showing the current selection to the user.
