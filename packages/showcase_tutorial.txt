# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Showcase Tutorial Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `showcase_tutorial` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  showcase_tutorial: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/showcase_tutorial).

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:showcase_tutorial/showcase_tutorial.dart';
```

## Step 3: Wrapping Your Widgets

To use the package, wrap the widgets you want to showcase with the `Showcase` widget. Here’s how to do it:

```dart
Showcase(
  key: showcaseKey,
  description: 'This is a button that does something amazing!',
  child: ElevatedButton(
    onPressed: () {},
    child: Text('Click Me!'),
  ),
)
```

## Step 4: Managing Showcases

You can manage the showcases using a `GlobalKey`. Here’s an example of how to set it up:

```dart
final GlobalKey<ShowcaseState> showcaseKey = GlobalKey<ShowcaseState>();
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 5: Running the App

After setting up the showcases, run your app using:

```bash
flutter run
```

This will launch your application, and you should see the showcases in action.

By following these steps, you can easily integrate the `showcase_tutorial` package into your Flutter application and provide a better user experience.

# Complete Example of Using the Showcase Tutorial Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:showcase_tutorial/showcase_tutorial.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Showcase Tutorial Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  // Create a GlobalKey for the Showcase
  final GlobalKey<ShowcaseState> showcaseKey = GlobalKey<ShowcaseState>();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Showcase Tutorial Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Showcase for the first button
            Showcase(
              key: showcaseKey,
              description: 'This is a button that does something amazing!',
              child: ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Action for the button
                },
                child: Text('Click Me!'),
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Another button without showcase
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action for the second button
              },
              child: Text('Another Button'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to start the showcase
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Start the showcase tutorial
                Showcase.of(context).startShowcase();
              },
              child: Text('Start Tutorial'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a HomeScreen as the home widget.
// 3. HomeScreen contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, there are three buttons:
//    - The first button is wrapped in a Showcase widget, which highlights it and provides a description.
//    - The second button is a regular button without any showcase.
//    - The third button starts the showcase tutorial when pressed.
// 5. When the "Start Tutorial" button is pressed, the tutorial will begin, highlighting the showcased button.
```
