# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using chips_input_autocomplete

## Installation
To use the `chips_input_autocomplete` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  chips_input_autocomplete: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/chips_input_autocomplete).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` to allow for any necessary permissions, especially if you are accessing contacts or other sensitive data.

## Basic Usage
Hereâ€™s how to implement the `chips_input_autocomplete` in your Flutter application:

1. Import the package:
   ```dart
   import 'package:chips_input_autocomplete/chips_input_autocomplete.dart';
   ```

2. Create a stateful widget to manage the input state:
   ```dart
   class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
     @override
     _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
   }

   class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
     List<String> selectedItems = [];
     List<String> suggestions = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry', 'Date', 'Elderberry'];

     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return Scaffold(
         appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Chips Input Autocomplete Example')),
         body: Padding(
           padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
           child: ChipsInputAutocomplete(
             suggestions: suggestions,
             onChanged: (value) {
               setState(() {
                 selectedItems = value;
               });
             },
             selectedItems: selectedItems,
           ),
         ),
       );
     }
   }
   ```

This code sets up a basic chips input autocomplete field that allows users to select fruits from a predefined list.

# Complete Example of chips_input_autocomplete

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:chips_input_autocomplete/chips_input_autocomplete.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Chips Input Autocomplete Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // List to hold selected items
  List<String> selectedItems = [];
  // List of suggestions for autocomplete
  List<String> suggestions = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry', 'Date', 'Elderberry'];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Chips Input Autocomplete Example')),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: ChipsInputAutocomplete(
          // Providing the suggestions list
          suggestions: suggestions,
          // Callback for when the selected items change
          onChanged: (value) {
            setState(() {
              selectedItems = value; // Update the selected items
            });
          },
          // Currently selected items
          selectedItems: selectedItems,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets MyApp as the home widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home screen.
// 3. RealFlutter is a stateful widget that maintains the state of selected items and suggestions.
// 4. The build method of _RealFlutterState creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a ChipsInputAutocomplete widget.
// 5. The ChipsInputAutocomplete widget takes a list of suggestions and a callback function that updates the selected items.
// 6. As users type, they see suggestions, and they can select items which will be displayed as chips.
// 7. The selected items are managed in the state, allowing for dynamic updates and rendering.
