# Setting Up and Using the Flutter UI Toolkit

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the flutter_ui_toolkit package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter project.

## Installation

To add the flutter_ui_toolkit package to your Flutter project, follow these steps:

1. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file.
2. Add the following dependency:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     flutter_ui_toolkit: ^latest_version
   ```

3. Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android
- Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid compatibility issues.

### iOS
- For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile` to at least 10.0.

## Basic Usage

Once the package is installed, you can start using its widgets in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use a pre-built button from the flutter_ui_toolkit:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_ui_toolkit/flutter_ui_toolkit.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter UI Toolkit Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: UIToolkitButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Action when button is pressed
              print('Button Pressed!');
            },
            child: Text('Press Me'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we import the necessary packages and create a simple app with a button that prints a message when pressed.

# Complete Example of Flutter UI Toolkit

Below is a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the flutter_ui_toolkit package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_ui_toolkit/flutter_ui_toolkit.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter UI Toolkit Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Using a pre-built button from the flutter_ui_toolkit
            UIToolkitButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action when button is pressed
                Navigator.push(
                  context,
                  MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => SecondScreen()),
                );
              },
              child: Text('Go to Second Screen'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SecondScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Second Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: UIToolkitButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Action to go back to the previous screen
            Navigator.pop(context);
          },
          child: Text('Back to Home'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is displayed as the home screen.
// 4. The HomeScreen contains a button that navigates to the SecondScreen when pressed.
// 5. The SecondScreen has a button that navigates back to the HomeScreen when pressed.
