# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Bubble Head Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the Bubble Head package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  bubble_head: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # Ensure this is set to at least 10.0
```

## Step 3: Using the Bubble Head Widget

Now that you have the package set up, you can start using the Bubble Head widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bubble_head/bubble_head.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Bubble Head Example')),
        body: ChatScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class ChatScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ListView(
      children: [
        BubbleHead(
          message: "Hello! How can I help you?",
          isSender: false,
          color: Colors.blue,
        ),
        BubbleHead(
          message: "I need assistance with my order.",
          isSender: true,
          color: Colors.green,
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple chat interface with two speech bubbles. The `isSender` property determines the alignment of the bubble.

# Complete Example of Bubble Head in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bubble_head/bubble_head.dart';

// Main entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// The main application widget
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Bubble Head Example')),
        body: ChatScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// ChatScreen widget to display chat bubbles
class ChatScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ListView(
      children: [
        // First bubble from the assistant
        BubbleHead(
          message: "Hello! How can I help you?", // Message text
          isSender: false, // Indicates this is not from the user
          color: Colors.blue, // Color of the bubble
        ),
        // Second bubble from the user
        BubbleHead(
          message: "I need assistance with my order.", // User's message
          isSender: true, // Indicates this is from the user
          color: Colors.green, // Color of the user's bubble
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application flow explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a body that displays the ChatScreen.
// 4. ChatScreen uses a ListView to display multiple BubbleHead widgets.
// 5. Each BubbleHead widget represents a message, with properties to customize the message text, sender status, and bubble color.
```
