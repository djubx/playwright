# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Animated List Item

## Step 1: Adding the Package
To get started, you need to add the `animated_list_item` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  animated_list_item: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement an animated list.

# Complete Example of Animated List Item

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_list_item/animated_list_item.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animated List Item Example',
      home: AnimatedListExample(),
    );
  }
}

class AnimatedListExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _AnimatedListExampleState createState() => _AnimatedListExampleState();
}

class _AnimatedListExampleState extends State<AnimatedListExample> {
  final List<String> _items = []; // List to hold the items
  final GlobalKey<AnimatedListState> _listKey = GlobalKey(); // Key for the animated list

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Animated List Item Example'),
        actions: [
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.add),
            onPressed: _addItem, // Add item on button press
          ),
        ],
      ),
      body: AnimatedList(
        key: _listKey,
        initialItemCount: _items.length, // Set initial item count
        itemBuilder: (context, index, animation) {
          return _buildItem(_items[index], animation); // Build each item
        },
      ),
    );
  }

  // Method to build each item with animation
  Widget _buildItem(String item, Animation<double> animation) {
    return SizeTransition(
      sizeFactor: animation, // Animate the size of the item
      child: Card(
        margin: EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 5, horizontal: 10),
        child: ListTile(
          title: Text(item), // Display the item text
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Method to add an item to the list
  void _addItem() {
    final newIndex = _items.length; // Get the new index
    _items.add('Item ${newIndex + 1}'); // Add new item to the list
    _listKey.currentState?.insertItem(newIndex); // Insert item in the animated list
  }
}
```

```dart
// Explanation of the application flow:

// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. AnimatedListExample is a StatefulWidget that manages the state of the animated list.
// 4. The _items list holds the data for the list.
// 5. The _listKey is used to control the AnimatedList.
// 6. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and an AnimatedList.
// 7. The AnimatedList's itemBuilder uses the _buildItem method to create each list item with animation.
// 8. The _buildItem method returns a SizeTransition widget that animates the size of the item.
// 9. The _addItem method adds a new item to the list and triggers the animation for the new item.
// 10. When the add button in the AppBar is pressed, a new item is added to the list, and the list updates with an animation.
