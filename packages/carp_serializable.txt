# Overview of the `carp_serializable` Flutter Package

The `carp_serializable` package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who need to serialize and deserialize data models efficiently. It leverages code generation to create boilerplate code for JSON serialization, making it easier to work with APIs and data storage. This package is particularly useful when dealing with complex data structures, as it reduces the amount of manual coding required for data conversion.

## When to Use `carp_serializable`
- **API Integration**: When your Flutter app interacts with RESTful APIs and requires converting JSON data to Dart objects and vice versa.
- **Local Data Storage**: When you need to store and retrieve structured data in local databases or shared preferences.
- **Complex Data Models**: When your application has nested or complex data models that require a robust serialization solution.

## Key Features
- **Code Generation**: Automatically generates serialization code, reducing manual effort and potential errors.
- **Support for Nested Objects**: Handles complex data structures with nested objects seamlessly.
- **Customizable Serialization Logic**: Allows developers to define custom serialization logic for specific fields.
- **Integration with Build Runner**: Works with the Dart build system to generate code during the build process.

Overall, `carp_serializable` simplifies the process of working with data models in Flutter applications, making it a valuable addition to any developer's toolkit.

# Setting Up and Using `carp_serializable`

## Installation
To get started with `carp_serializable`, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and include the following dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  carp_serializable: ^latest_version

dev_dependencies:
  build_runner: ^latest_version
  carp_serializable_generator: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/carp_serializable).

## Configuration
After adding the dependencies, you need to run the following command in your terminal to install the packages:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

Next, you will need to create a model class that you want to serialize. For example, let's create a simple `RealFlutter` class:

```dart
import 'package:carp_serializable/carp_serializable.dart';

part 'real_flutter.g.dart'; // This is where the generated code will be placed.

@CarpSerializable()
class RealFlutter {
  final String name;
  final int age;

  RealFlutter({required this.name, required this.age});
}
```

## Generating Code
To generate the serialization code, run the following command:

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build
```

This command will create a file named `real_flutter.g.dart` containing the necessary serialization logic.

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid compatibility issues.

### iOS
For iOS, make sure to enable the necessary permissions in your `Info.plist` if your app requires network access.

## Using the Package
Once the setup is complete, you can easily serialize and deserialize your `RealFlutter` objects. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```dart
// Example of serialization
final realFlutter = RealFlutter(name: 'Flutter Dev', age: 30);
final json = realFlutter.toJson(); // Convert to JSON

// Example of deserialization
final newRealFlutter = RealFlutter.fromJson(json); // Convert back from JSON
```

With these steps, you are now ready to use the `carp_serializable` package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Using `carp_serializable`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:carp_serializable/carp_serializable.dart';

part 'real_flutter.g.dart'; // This is where the generated code will be placed.

@CarpSerializable()
class RealFlutter {
  final String name;
  final int age;

  RealFlutter({required this.name, required this.age});
}

// Main function to run the app
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Carp Serializable Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Carp Serializable Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: FutureBuilder<RealFlutter>(
            future: fetchRealFlutterData(), // Fetching data asynchronously
            builder: (context, snapshot) {
              if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                return CircularProgressIndicator(); // Show loading indicator
              } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
                return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}'); // Show error message
              } else {
                final realFlutter = snapshot.data; // Get the data
                return Text('Name: ${realFlutter?.name}, Age: ${realFlutter?.age}'); // Display data
              }
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Simulated fetch function to demonstrate serialization
  Future<RealFlutter> fetchRealFlutterData() async {
    // Simulating network delay
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));
    
    // Creating a RealFlutter object
    final realFlutter = RealFlutter(name: 'Flutter Dev', age: 30);
    
    // Serializing to JSON
    final json = realFlutter.toJson();
    
    // Simulating a network response by returning the same object
    return RealFlutter.fromJson(json); // Deserialize back to object
  }
}
```

// The above code demonstrates the use of the `carp_serializable` package in a Flutter application.
// 
// 1. **Imports**: The necessary packages are imported, including `carp_serializable` for serialization.
// 2. **Model Class**: The `RealFlutter` class is defined with the `@CarpSerializable()` annotation, allowing it to be serialized.
// 3. **Main Function**: The `main()` function initializes the Flutter app.
// 4. **MyApp Widget**: The main widget of the app, which contains a `FutureBuilder` to handle asynchronous data fetching.
// 5. **Data Fetching**: The `fetchRealFlutterData()` function simulates fetching data, serializes a `RealFlutter` object to JSON, and then deserializes it back to an object.
// 6. **UI**: The UI displays either a loading indicator, an error message, or the fetched data once available.

// This example showcases how to set up and use the `carp_serializable` package effectively in a Flutter application, demonstrating both serialization and deserialization processes.
