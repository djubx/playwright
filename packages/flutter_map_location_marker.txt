# Tutorial: Setting Up flutter_map_location_marker

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_map_location_marker` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependencies

First, you need to add the `flutter_map` and `flutter_map_location_marker` packages to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_map: ^0.14.0
  flutter_map_location_marker: ^0.14.0
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the new dependencies.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configurations

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file to request location permissions:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show it on the map.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show it on the map.</string>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that we have set up the dependencies and configurations, we can start using the `flutter_map_location_marker` package in our application.

1. Import the necessary packages in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_map/flutter_map.dart';
import 'package:flutter_map_location_marker/flutter_map_location_marker.dart';
import 'package:latlong2/latlong.dart';
```

2. Create a simple Flutter application that displays a map with the user's location marker.

# Complete Example: RealFlutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_map/flutter_map.dart';
import 'package:flutter_map_location_marker/flutter_map_location_marker.dart';
import 'package:latlong2/latlong.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Map Location Marker',
      home: MapScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class MapScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MapScreenState createState() => _MapScreenState();
}

class _MapScreenState extends State<MapScreen> {
  // Create a MapController to control the map
  final MapController _mapController = MapController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Location Marker Example'),
      ),
      body: FlutterMap(
        // Initialize the map with a center point and zoom level
        mapController: _mapController,
        options: MapOptions(
          center: LatLng(51.5, -0.09), // Default center point
          zoom: 13.0, // Default zoom level
        ),
        layers: [
          // Add a tile layer to display the map
          TileLayerOptions(
            urlTemplate: "https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",
            subdomains: ['a', 'b', 'c'],
          ),
          // Add the location marker layer
          LocationMarkerLayerOptions(
            // Customize the marker if needed
            marker: DefaultLocationMarker(),
            // Enable the location updates
            updateMap: true,
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds the MaterialApp with a title and home screen.
// 3. The MapScreen widget is created, which contains the map.
// 4. A MapController is initialized to control the map's state.
// 5. The FlutterMap widget is set up with options for center and zoom level.
// 6. A TileLayer is added to display the map tiles from OpenStreetMap.
// 7. The LocationMarkerLayer is added to show the user's current location on the map.
// 8. The app will automatically update the user's location on the map as it changes.
```
