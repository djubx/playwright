# Flutter Deep Linking Package: Setup Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_deep_linking` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

First, add the `flutter_deep_linking` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_deep_linking: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Configure for Android

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following intent filter inside the `<activity>` tag:

   ```xml
   <intent-filter>
       <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
       <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
       <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
       <data android:scheme="your_scheme" android:host="your_host" />
   </intent-filter>
   ```

   Replace `your_scheme` and `your_host` with your desired values.

2. **Permissions**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` if your app requires them.

## Step 3: Configure for iOS

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open your `Info.plist` file located in `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

   ```xml
   <key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
   <array>
       <dict>
           <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
           <array>
               <string>your_scheme</string>
           </array>
       </dict>
   </array>
   ```

   Again, replace `your_scheme` with your desired scheme.

2. **Handle Incoming Links**: Ensure your app can handle incoming links by implementing the necessary logic in your Flutter code.

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that we have configured the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Hereâ€™s how to set up deep linking in your app:

1. **Import the Package**:

   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter_deep_linking/flutter_deep_linking.dart';
   ```

2. **Initialize Deep Linking**:

   In your main application file, initialize the deep linking functionality:

   ```dart
   void main() {
       runApp(MyApp());
       DeepLinking.init();
   }
   ```

3. **Listen for Links**:

   You can listen for incoming links and navigate to the appropriate screen based on the link:

   ```dart
   DeepLinking.onLinkReceived.listen((String link) {
       // Handle the incoming link
       // Navigate to the appropriate screen based on the link
   });
   ```

With these steps, you have successfully set up deep linking in your Flutter application using the `flutter_deep_linking` package.

# Flutter Deep Linking Package: Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_deep_linking/flutter_deep_linking.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
  // Initialize the deep linking functionality
  DeepLinking.init();
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Deep Linking Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Simulate a deep link
            DeepLinking.sendLink('your_scheme://details?id=1');
          },
          child: Text('Go to Details'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DetailsScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final String id;

  DetailsScreen({required this.id});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Details Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Details for item $id'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Listen for incoming deep links
DeepLinking.onLinkReceived.listen((String link) {
  // Parse the link to extract the id
  final uri = Uri.parse(link);
  if (uri.pathSegments.length > 1) {
    final id = uri.queryParameters['id'];
    // Navigate to the DetailsScreen with the extracted id
    Navigator.push(
      navigatorKey.currentContext!,
      MaterialPageRoute(
        builder: (context) => DetailsScreen(id: id!),
      ),
    );
  }
});

// Explanation of the application flow:
// 1. The app starts with the HomeScreen.
// 2. When the user taps the "Go to Details" button, a simulated deep link is sent.
// 3. The app listens for incoming deep links using the `onLinkReceived` stream.
// 4. When a deep link is received, it parses the link to extract the item id.
// 5. The app navigates to the DetailsScreen, displaying the details for the specified item.
```

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The app initializes and displays the HomeScreen.
// 2. The user can tap a button to simulate sending a deep link.
// 3. The app listens for incoming deep links and processes them.
// 4. Upon receiving a link, it extracts the item id and navigates to the DetailsScreen.
// 5. The DetailsScreen displays the relevant information based on the id received from the deep link.
