// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The RealFlutter class is defined with a method called demonstrateAmplifyLints.
// 2. The demonstrateAmplifyLints method contains several issues that Amplify Lints will report on.
// 3. The main function creates an instance of the RealFlutter class and calls the demonstrateAmplifyLints method.
// 4. Amplify Lints analyzes the code and reports on the issues found.

// In summary, this code demonstrates how Amplify Lints can help identify and fix common issues in Flutter code.
// By using Amplify Lints, developers can ensure that their code is clean, maintainable, and follows best practices.
