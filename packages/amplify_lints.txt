# Amplify Lints Flutter Package

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
## Description

The `amplify_lints` package is a Flutter package designed to provide a set of linting rules specifically tailored for projects that utilize the AWS Amplify framework. Linting is an essential part of the development process, as it helps maintain code quality and consistency across the codebase. This package is particularly useful for developers working with AWS Amplify, as it ensures that best practices are followed and potential issues are caught early in the development cycle.

### When to Use

You should consider using the `amplify_lints` package in your Flutter projects if:
- You are integrating AWS Amplify services (like authentication, storage, or APIs) into your application.
- You want to enforce coding standards and best practices specific to AWS Amplify.
- You are working in a team and want to ensure consistency in code quality across different developers.

### Features

- **Custom Lint Rules**: The package provides a set of custom lint rules that are specifically designed for AWS Amplify projects.
- **Integration with Dart Analysis**: It integrates seamlessly with Dart's analysis tools, allowing you to catch issues during development.
- **Improved Code Quality**: By following the linting rules, developers can improve the overall quality and maintainability of their code.
- **Configurability**: You can customize the linting rules according to your project's needs.

## Tutorial

### Installation

To get started with the `amplify_lints` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  amplify_lints: ^0.1.0
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Configuration

Once the package is installed, you need to configure it to use the lint rules. Create or update the `analysis_options.yaml` file in the root of your Flutter project with the following content:

```yaml
include: package:amplify_lints/amplify_lints.yaml
```

This configuration will include the custom lint rules provided by the `amplify_lints` package.

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file is configured correctly to support the necessary dependencies for AWS Amplify. You may need to add the following dependencies:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.amplifyframework:core:1.28.0'
    implementation 'com.amplifyframework:aws-auth-cognito:1.28.0'
    // Add other Amplify dependencies as needed
}
```

#### iOS

For iOS, make sure to update your `ios/Podfile` to include the necessary Amplify dependencies. You can do this by adding:

```ruby
pod 'Amplify', '~> 1.28.0'
pod 'AmplifyPlugins/AWSCognitoAuthPlugin', '~> 1.28.0'
# Add other Amplify plugins as needed
```

After making changes to the Podfile, run:

```bash
cd ios
pod install
```

### Using the Package

Once you have set up the package and configured your project, you can start using the lint rules in your development process. The linter will automatically check your code against the defined rules whenever you run `flutter analyze`.

## Complete Example

Here is a complete example of a Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the `amplify_lints` package. This example includes a simple app that integrates AWS Amplify for user authentication.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:amplify_flutter/amplify.dart';
import 'package:amplify_auth_cognito/amplify_auth_cognito.dart';
import 'amplifyconfiguration.dart'; // Ensure you have your Amplify configuration file

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _message = 'Welcome!';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _configureAmplify();
  }

  // Method to configure Amplify
  Future<void> _configureAmplify() async {
    // Create an instance of the Amplify Auth plugin
    final authPlugin = AmplifyAuthCognito();

    // Add the plugin to Amplify
    await Amplify.addPlugin(authPlugin);

    // Configure Amplify with the configuration file
    await Amplify.configure(amplifyconfig);
    
    // Update the message to indicate successful configuration
    setState(() {
      _message = 'Amplify configured successfully!';
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Amplify Lints Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(_message), // Display the message
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatefulWidget that manages its state.
// 3. In the initState method, the _configureAmplify method is called to set up AWS Amplify.
// 4. The _configureAmplify method creates an instance of the Amplify Auth plugin and adds it to Amplify.
// 5. It then configures Amplify using the configuration file (amplifyconfiguration.dart).
// 6. Once configured, the message is updated to indicate success.
// 7. The build method returns a MaterialApp with a simple UI that displays the current message.
```
