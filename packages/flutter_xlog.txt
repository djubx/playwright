# flutter_xlog: A Comprehensive Logging Package for Flutter

The `flutter_xlog` package is a powerful logging tool designed for Flutter applications. It provides developers with a simple and efficient way to log messages, errors, and other important information during the development and debugging process. This package is particularly useful for applications that require detailed logging for troubleshooting and performance monitoring.

## When to Use `flutter_xlog`
- **Debugging**: When you need to track down issues in your application, logging can provide insights into what is happening at runtime.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Log performance metrics to analyze the efficiency of your application.
- **Error Tracking**: Capture and log errors to understand failure points in your application.

## Key Features
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Custom Log Levels**: Supports various log levels (e.g., debug, info, warning, error) to categorize log messages.
- **File Logging**: Ability to log messages to files for persistent storage.
- **Log Filtering**: Filter logs based on severity levels to focus on critical issues.

Overall, `flutter_xlog` is an essential tool for any Flutter developer looking to enhance their application's logging capabilities.

# Setting Up and Using `flutter_xlog`

## Installation
To add `flutter_xlog` to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_xlog: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_xlog).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save logs.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera for logging purposes.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To start using `flutter_xlog`, you need to initialize the logger and start logging messages. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_xlog/flutter_xlog.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the logger
  XLog.init();
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter XLog Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Log an info message
              XLog.i('Button Pressed!');
            },
            child: Text('Press Me'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, an info log message is generated.

# Complete Example of `flutter_xlog`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_xlog/flutter_xlog.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the logger
  XLog.init();
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter XLog Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Log an info message when the button is pressed
              XLog.i('Button Pressed!');
            },
            child: Text('Press Me'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the logger by calling XLog.init().
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is displayed.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the onPressed callback is triggered.
// 6. The callback logs an info message "Button Pressed!" using XLog.i().
// 7. This message can be viewed in the console or saved to a log file, depending on the configuration.
