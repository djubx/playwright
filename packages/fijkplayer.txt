# Setting Up FijkPlayer in Your Flutter Project

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started with FijkPlayer, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  fijkplayer: ^0.8.0
```

## Step 2: Install Packages
Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version required
    }
}
```

2. Ensure you have the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to play videos.</string>
```

## Step 4: Basic Usage
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:fijkplayer/fijkplayer.dart';
```

You can now create an instance of `FijkPlayer` and use it to play videos.

## Conclusion
With these steps, you have successfully set up FijkPlayer in your Flutter project. You can now proceed to implement video playback features in your application.

# Complete Example of FijkPlayer in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fijkplayer/fijkplayer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Create an instance of FijkPlayer
  FijkPlayer player;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the FijkPlayer instance
    player = FijkPlayer();
    // Set the video source (URL or local file)
    player.setDataSource("https://www.example.com/video.mp4", autoPlay: true);
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the player when the widget is removed from the widget tree
    player.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('FijkPlayer Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            children: [
              // Display the video player
              Container(
                height: 300,
                child: FijkView(
                  player: player,
                  fit: FijkFit.cover, // Set the fit of the video
                ),
              ),
              // Play/Pause button
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Toggle play/pause
                  if (player.isPlaying) {
                    player.pause();
                  } else {
                    player.start();
                  }
                },
                child: Text(player.isPlaying ? 'Pause' : 'Play'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget, we create an instance of FijkPlayer.
// 3. The video source is set in the initState method, and the video starts playing automatically.
// 4. The FijkView widget displays the video player on the screen.
// 5. A button is provided to toggle between play and pause states.
// 6. When the widget is disposed, the FijkPlayer instance is also disposed to free up resources.
```

// The application flow is straightforward:
// - The app initializes the FijkPlayer and sets the video source.
// - The video is displayed using the FijkView widget.
// - Users can play or pause the video using the button provided.
// - Proper resource management is ensured by disposing of the player when the widget is removed.
