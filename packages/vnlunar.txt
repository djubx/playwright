# Setting Up and Using the vnlunar Package

## Installation
To get started with the vnlunar package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  vnlunar: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, no additional configuration is required. The package works out of the box.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least iOS 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the vnlunar Package
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the vnlunar package to convert a solar date to a lunar date and display the current lunar phase.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:vnlunar/vnlunar.dart';
```

2. Create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class to utilize the package's functionalities.

3. Use the provided methods to perform date conversions and retrieve lunar phase information.

# Complete Example of Using vnlunar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:vnlunar/vnlunar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Lunar Calendar Example',
      home: LunarHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class LunarHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _LunarHomePageState createState() => _LunarHomePageState();
}

class _LunarHomePageState extends State<LunarHomePage> {
  String lunarDate = '';
  String lunarPhase = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Convert today's date to lunar date
    DateTime today = DateTime.now();
    Lunar lunar = Lunar.fromDate(today);
    lunarDate = lunar.toString(); // Get the lunar date as a string

    // Get the current lunar phase
    lunarPhase = lunar.getLunarPhase(); // Get the lunar phase
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Lunar Calendar'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Lunar Date: $lunarDate'), // Display lunar date
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text('Current Lunar Phase: $lunarPhase'), // Display lunar phase
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code defines a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the vnlunar package.
// 1. The `main` function initializes the app by running the `RealFlutter` widget.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` widget sets up the MaterialApp with a title and a home page.
// 3. The `LunarHomePage` stateful widget is created to manage the state of the lunar date and phase.
// 4. In the `initState` method, the current date is converted to a lunar date using the `Lunar.fromDate` method.
// 5. The lunar date and phase are stored in state variables and displayed in the UI.
// 6. The UI consists of a simple Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget that contains text displaying the lunar date and phase.
