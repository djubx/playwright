# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Timeline Tile Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To use the **timeline_tile** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  timeline_tile: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install the Package
Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your `ios/Podfile` has the platform set to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Import the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:timeline_tile/timeline_tile.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the TimelineTile Widget
You can now use the `TimelineTile` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a vertical timeline:

```dart
TimelineTile(
  alignment: TimelineAlign.start,
  isFirst: true,
  indicatorStyle: IndicatorStyle(
    color: Colors.blue,
    iconStyle: IconStyle(
      iconData: Icons.check,
      color: Colors.white,
    ),
  ),
  endChild: Padding(
    padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
    child: Text("Event 1"),
  ),
),
```

This code creates a timeline tile with a blue indicator and a text label for the first event.

# Complete Example of Using the Timeline Tile Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:timeline_tile/timeline_tile.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Timeline Tile Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Timeline Tile Example'),
        ),
        body: TimelineExample(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class TimelineExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ListView(
      children: [
        // First timeline tile
        TimelineTile(
          alignment: TimelineAlign.start,
          isFirst: true,
          indicatorStyle: IndicatorStyle(

            child: Text("Event 1: Started Project"),
          ),
        ),
        // Second timeline tile
        TimelineTile(
          alignment: TimelineAlign.start,
          isLast: false,
          indicatorStyle: IndicatorStyle(
            color: Colors.blue,
            iconStyle: IconStyle(
              iconData: Icons.check,
              color: Colors.white,
            ),
          ),
          endChild: Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
            child: Text("Event 2: Development Phase"),
          ),
        ),
        // Third timeline tile
        TimelineTile(
          alignment: TimelineAlign.start,
          isLast: true,
          indicatorStyle: IndicatorStyle(
            color: Colors.blue,
            iconStyle: IconStyle(
              iconData: Icons.check,
              color: Colors.white,
            ),
          ),
          endChild: Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
            child: Text("Event 3: Project Completed"),
          ),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Timeline Tile Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is a ListView that contains multiple TimelineTile widgets.
// 5. Each TimelineTile represents an event in the timeline, with an indicator and a description.
// 6. The timeline flows vertically, showcasing the sequence of events from start to completion.
