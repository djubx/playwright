```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_story_view/flutter_story_view.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Story View Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  List<Story> stories = [
    Story(
      child: Image.asset('assets/image1.jpg'),
      // Show the progress indicator
      showProgress: true,
    ),
    Story(
      child: Image.asset('assets/image2.jpg'),
      // Show the swipe gestures
      showSwipe: true,
    ),
    Story(
      child: VideoPlayer(
        videoUrl: 'https://example.com/video.mp4',
      ),
      // Show the video controls
      showControls: true,
    ),
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Story View Demo'),
      ),
      body: StoryView(
        stories: stories,
        // Show the story view
        showStory: true,
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application flow:
// 1. The app starts and displays the story view.
// 2. The user can swipe between the stories.
// 3. The user can see the progress indicator for each story.
// 4. The user can see the video controls for the video story.
// 5. The user can navigate back to the previous story by swiping left.
// 6. The user can navigate to the next story by swiping right.
```

// Summary:
// The code flows by first displaying the story view, then allowing the user to swipe between the stories.
// The user can see the progress indicator for each story and the video controls for the video story.
// The user can navigate back to the previous story by swiping left and to the next story by swiping right.
