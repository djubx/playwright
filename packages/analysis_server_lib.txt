// This is the main entry point of the app.
// It creates an analysis server instance and analyzes a file.
// The analysis result is then printed to the console.
// Finally, a Flutter app is created and run.

// The app uses the Material theme and has a simple scaffold with an app bar and a body.
// The body contains a single text widget that displays a message.

// To use this code, simply copy and paste it into a new Dart file.
// Make sure to replace 'path/to/your/code.dart' with the actual path to the file you want to analyze.
// Then, run the app using the Flutter command-line tool.

// Note that this code assumes that the analysis server lib package is installed and imported.
// If you haven't installed the package yet, make sure to add it to your pubspec file and run pub get.

// Also, make sure to configure the analysis server to suit your needs.
// For example, you can set the analysis server to only analyze specific files or directories.
// You can also use caching to improve performance.
