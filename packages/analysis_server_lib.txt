# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Analysis Server Lib

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `analysis_server_lib` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Package to Your Project
To get started, you need to add the `analysis_server_lib` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  analysis_server_lib: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/analysis_server_lib).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` to allow network requests if you are using the analysis server over a network.

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage
Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in a Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to initialize the analysis server and perform a basic analysis.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:analysis_server_lib/analysis_server_lib.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late AnalysisServer _analysisServer;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _initializeAnalysisServer();
  }

  void _initializeAnalysisServer() {
    // Initialize the analysis server
    _analysisServer = AnalysisServer();
    _analysisServer.start();

    // Listen for analysis results
    _analysisServer.onAnalysisComplete.listen((event) {
      // Handle analysis results
      print('Analysis complete: ${event.results}');
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _analysisServer.stop();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Analysis Server Example')),
        body: Center(child: Text('Running Analysis Server')),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize the `AnalysisServer` in the `initState` method and listen for analysis results. When the analysis is complete, we print the results to the console.

# Complete Example: RealFlutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:analysis_server_lib/analysis_server_lib.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late AnalysisServer _analysisServer; // Declare the analysis server

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _initializeAnalysisServer(); // Initialize the analysis server
  }

  void _initializeAnalysisServer() {
    // Initialize the analysis server
    _analysisServer = AnalysisServer();
    _analysisServer.start(); // Start the analysis server

    // Listen for analysis results
    _analysisServer.onAnalysisComplete.listen((event) {
      // Handle analysis results
      print('Analysis complete: ${event.results}'); // Print results to console
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _analysisServer.stop(); // Stop the analysis server when disposing
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Analysis Server Example')), // App title
        body: Center(child: Text('Running Analysis Server')), // Main content
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the `RealFlutter` widget.
// 2. In the `initState` method, we initialize the `AnalysisServer`.
// 3. The server is started, and we set up a listener for analysis results.
// 4. When the analysis is complete, the results are printed to the console.
// 5. The `dispose` method ensures that the server is stopped when the widget is removed from the widget tree.
// 6. The UI consists of a simple app bar and a centered text indicating that the analysis server is running.
```
