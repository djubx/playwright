# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Super Bullet List Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **super_bullet_list** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  super_bullet_list: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:super_bullet_list/super_bullet_list.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Super Bullet List

You can now use the `SuperBulletList` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
SuperBulletList(
  items: [
    'First bullet point',
    'Second bullet point',
    'Third bullet point',
  ],
  bulletStyle: BulletStyle.circle,
  bulletColor: Colors.blue,
  bulletSize: 10.0,
)
```

This will create a bullet list with blue circular bullets.

      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Super Bullet List Demo'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: SuperBulletList(
            // List of items to display
            items: [
              'Learn Flutter',
              'Build beautiful UIs',
              'Deploy to multiple platforms',
              'Join the Flutter community',
            ],
            // Customizing bullet style
            bulletStyle: BulletStyle.circle,
            // Setting bullet color
            bulletColor: Colors.green,
            // Setting bullet size
            bulletSize: 12.0,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with MyApp as the root widget.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Super Bullet List Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold has a Padding widget to provide space around the SuperBulletList.
// 5. The SuperBulletList widget is initialized with a list of items to display as bullet points.
// 6. The bullet style is set to circular, with a green color and a size of 12.0.
// 7. The app will render a list of bullet points with the specified styles and properties.
