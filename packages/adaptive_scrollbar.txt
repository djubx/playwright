# Tutorial: Using the Adaptive Scrollbar Package
=============================================

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

Add the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  adaptive_scrollbar: ^1.0.0
```
Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:adaptive_scrollbar/adaptive_scrollbar.dart';
```
### Step 3: Use the Adaptive Scrollbar

Use the `AdaptiveScrollbar` widget with a `ListView` or `GridView` widget:
```dart
AdaptiveScrollbar(
  child: ListView(
    children: [
      // Your list items here
    ],
  ),
)
```
### Platform-Specific Details

* Android: The scrollbar will be displayed as a thin line on the right side of the screen.
* iOS: The scrollbar will be displayed as a thin line on the right side of the screen, with a rounded corner at the top.
* Web: The scrollbar will be displayed as a thin line on the right side of the screen, with a rounded corner at the top.

### Configurations and Optimizations

* You can customize the appearance of the scrollbar by using the `AdaptiveScrollbar` constructor's optional parameters (e.g. `color`, `width`, `radius`).
* You can also use the `AdaptiveScrollbar` widget with a `GridView` widget by passing a `GridView` instance as the `child` parameter.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:adaptive_scrollbar/adaptive_scrollbar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Adaptive Scrollbar Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Adaptive Scrollbar Demo'),
      ),
      body: AdaptiveScrollbar(
        // Customize the scrollbar appearance
        color: Colors.red,
        width: 10,
        radius: 10,
        child: ListView(
          children: [
            // Your list items here
            ListTile(
              title: Text('Item 1'),
            ),
            ListTile(
              title: Text('Item 2'),
            ),
            ListTile(
              title: Text('Item 3'),
            ),
            // ...
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application flow:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a list of items.
// 2. The user scrolls through the list, and the adaptive scrollbar is displayed on the right side of the screen.
// 3. The user can customize the appearance of the scrollbar by modifying the `AdaptiveScrollbar` constructor's optional parameters.
// 4. The app uses the `AdaptiveScrollbar` widget with a `ListView` widget to display the list of items.
// 5. The app also uses the `MaterialApp` widget to provide a basic material design theme to the app.

// Summary:
// The code flows by first creating a `MaterialApp` instance, which provides a basic material design theme to the app.
// Then, it creates a `MyHomePage` instance, which is a stateful widget that contains the adaptive scrollbar and the list of items.
// The adaptive scrollbar is customized to have a red color, a width of 10, and a radius of 10.
// The list of items is displayed using a `ListView` widget, which is passed as the `child` parameter to the `AdaptiveScrollbar` widget.
