# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Open WhatsApp Package

## Installation
To use the `open_whatsapp` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  open_whatsapp: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Ensure that your app has the necessary permissions to access the internet. Add the following line to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

2. No additional configuration is required for opening WhatsApp.

### iOS
1. For iOS, you need to ensure that your app can open URLs. Add the following to your `Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
    <string>whatsapp</string>
</array>
```

## Using the Package
To use the `open_whatsapp` package, you can call the `OpenWhatsapp` class and pass the required parameters. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to open a chat with a specific number:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:open_whatsapp/open_whatsapp.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Open WhatsApp Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              OpenWhatsapp.sendSingleMessage('+1234567890', 'Hello from Flutter!');
            },
            child: Text('Open WhatsApp'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code creates a simple Flutter app with a button that, when pressed, opens a WhatsApp chat with the specified phone number and a pre-filled message.

# Complete Example of Open WhatsApp Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:open_whatsapp/open_whatsapp.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Open WhatsApp Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // This function is called when the button is pressed
              // It opens a WhatsApp chat with the specified phone number
              // and pre-fills the message
              OpenWhatsapp.sendSingleMessage('+1234567890', 'Hello from Flutter!');
            },
            child: Text('Open WhatsApp'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  // The main function is the entry point of the Flutter application
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the onPressed callback is triggered.
// 5. The OpenWhatsapp.sendSingleMessage() method is called with the specified phone number and message.
// 6. This action opens the WhatsApp application on the user's device, allowing them to send the message directly.
