Here's a detailed technical blog on the `reactive_pinput` Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Reactive Pinput Flutter Package

The `reactive_pinput` package is a powerful and flexible input widget for Flutter that allows developers to create reactive input fields with a focus on user experience. This package is particularly useful for scenarios where you need to collect user input in a visually appealing and interactive manner, such as entering verification codes, passwords, or any multi-part input.

## When to Use `reactive_pinput`

You should consider using the `reactive_pinput` package in the following scenarios:

- **Multi-part Input**: When you need to collect input that is divided into multiple segments, such as OTP (One Time Password) entry.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: If you want to provide a more engaging and responsive input experience compared to standard text fields.
- **Validation**: When you need to implement real-time validation and feedback for user input.

## Features

- **Customizable Appearance**: You can easily customize the look and feel of the input fields to match your app's design.
- **Reactive Behavior**: The input fields react to user input in real-time, providing immediate feedback.
- **Validation Support**: Built-in support for input validation, allowing you to enforce rules on user input.
- **Focus Management**: Automatically manages focus between input fields, enhancing the user experience.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `reactive_pinput`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `reactive_pinput` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  reactive_pinput: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `reactive_pinput` in your app.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:reactive_pinput/reactive_pinput.dart';
```

2. Create a simple form using `ReactivePinput`:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Reactive Pinput Example')),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              ReactivePinput(
                length: 4, // Number of input fields
                onChanged: (value) {
                  // Handle input change
                  print('Current input: $value');
                },
                decoration: InputDecoration(
                  border: OutlineInputBorder(),
                  labelText: 'Enter OTP',
                ),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Handle button press
                  print('OTP submitted');
                },
                child: Text('Submit'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Run your application:

```bash
flutter run
```

This will launch your Flutter application with a reactive input field for OTP entry.

# Complete Example of `reactive_pinput`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:reactive_pinput/reactive_pinput.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Reactive Pinput Example')),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // ReactivePinput widget for OTP input
              ReactivePinput(
                length: 4, // Number of input fields
                onChanged: (value) {
                  // Handle input change
                  print('Current input: $value');
                },
                decoration: InputDecoration(
                  border: OutlineInputBorder(),
                  labelText: 'Enter OTP',
                ),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Elevated button to submit the OTP
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Handle button press
                  print('OTP submitted');
                },
                child: Text('Submit'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The MaterialApp widget is created, providing the app structure.
// 3. A Scaffold widget is used to create the basic visual layout with an AppBar.
// 4. Inside the body of the Scaffold, a Padding widget is used to add space around the content.
// 5. A Column widget is used to arrange the input field and button vertically.
// 6. The ReactivePinput widget is created with a length of 4, allowing the user to enter a 4-digit OTP.
// 7. The onChanged callback is triggered whenever the input changes, printing the current input value to the console.
// 8. An ElevatedButton is provided to submit the OTP, which prints a message to the console when pressed.
// 9. The app is run using the flutter run command, displaying the input field and button to the user.
```
