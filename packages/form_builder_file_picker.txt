# Overview of the `form_builder_file_picker` Flutter Package

The `form_builder_file_picker` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that simplifies the process of integrating file picking functionality into forms. This package is particularly useful when you need users to upload files, such as images, documents, or any other type of file, directly from their devices.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the `form_builder_file_picker` package in scenarios such as:
- **User Profile Management**: Allowing users to upload profile pictures or documents.
- **File Upload Forms**: Creating forms that require users to submit files, such as resumes or project files.
- **Media Applications**: Enabling users to select images or videos for sharing or editing.

## Key Features
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Customizable UI**: Allows developers to customize the file picker interface to match their app's design.
- **Multiple File Selection**: Supports selecting multiple files at once.
- **File Type Filtering**: Enables filtering of file types to ensure users only select the desired file formats.

With these features, the `form_builder_file_picker` package provides a robust solution for file selection in Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `form_builder_file_picker`

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `form_builder_file_picker` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `form_builder_file_picker` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  form_builder_file_picker: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/form_builder_file_picker).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file. Add the following lines inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file to request permission for accessing files:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to upload images.</string>
<key>NSDocumentDirectoryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your documents to upload files.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the file picker in a form.

1. Import the necessary packages:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_form_builder/flutter_form_builder.dart';
import 'package:form_builder_file_picker/form_builder_file_picker.dart';
```

2. Create a form with a file picker field:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('File Picker Example')),
      body: FormBuilder(
        child: Column(
          children: [
            FormBuilderFilePicker(
              name: 'files',
              allowMultiple: true,
              previewImages: true,
              onChanged: (value) {
                // Handle file selection
              },
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Select Files'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Submit the form
              },
              child: Text('Submit'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic form with a file picker that allows users to select multiple files. The `onChanged` callback can be used to handle the selected files.

# Complete Example of `form_builder_file_picker`

Below is a complete example of a Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the `form_builder_file_picker` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_form_builder/flutter_form_builder.dart';
import 'package:form_builder_file_picker/form_builder_file_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'File Picker Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('File Picker Example')),
      body: FormBuilder(
        child: Column(
          children: [
            // File picker field allowing multiple file selection
            FormBuilderFilePicker(
              name: 'files', // Name of the field
              allowMultiple: true, // Allow multiple file selection
              previewImages: true, // Preview selected images
              onChanged: (value) {
                // Handle file selection
                print('Selected files: $value');
              },
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Select Files'), // Label for the file picker
            ),
            // Submit button
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Handle form submission
                print('Form submitted');
              },
              child: Text('Submit'), // Button text
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp and specifies the home widget as RealFlutter.
// 3. RealFlutter builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a FormBuilder.
// 4. Inside the FormBuilder, a FormBuilderFilePicker is created, allowing users to select multiple files.
// 5. The onChanged callback prints the selected files to the console.
// 6. An ElevatedButton is provided to submit the form, which currently just prints a message to the console.
