# Mason Logger Flutter Package

The **mason_logger** package is a powerful logging utility designed for Flutter applications. It provides a simple and effective way to log messages, errors, and other important information during the development and production phases of your app. This package is particularly useful for developers who want to maintain a clean and organized logging system, making it easier to debug and monitor their applications.

## When to Use Mason Logger

You should consider using the **mason_logger** package in scenarios such as:

- **Debugging**: When you need to track down issues in your application, logging can help you understand the flow of data and identify where things go wrong.
- **Monitoring**: In production applications, logging can provide insights into user behavior and application performance.
- **Error Reporting**: Capture and log errors to help with troubleshooting and improving the user experience.

## Features

- **Customizable Log Levels**: Control the verbosity of your logs with different log levels (e.g., info, warning, error).
- **Formatted Output**: Log messages can be formatted for better readability.
- **File Logging**: Optionally log messages to a file for persistent storage.

# Tutorial: Setting Up Mason Logger

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **mason_logger** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the **mason_logger** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  mason_logger: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/mason_logger).

## Step 2: Install the Package

Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to log messages:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mason_logger/mason_logger.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Mason Logger Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Create an instance of the logger
              final logger = Logger();

              // Log messages at different levels
              logger.info('This is an info message');
              logger.warning('This is a warning message');
              logger.error('This is an error message');
            },
            child: Text('Log Messages'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app with a button that logs messages when pressed. The logger instance is created, and messages are logged at different levels.

# Complete Example of Mason Logger

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mason_logger/mason_logger.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Mason Logger Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Create an instance of the logger
              final logger = Logger();

              // Log messages at different levels
              logger.info('This is an info message'); // Informational message
              logger.warning('This is a warning message'); // Warning message
              logger.error('This is an error message'); // Error message
            },
            child: Text('Log Messages'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the Flutter application by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, there is an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, an instance of Logger is created.
// 6. The logger instance is used to log messages at different levels: info, warning, and error.
// 7. These log messages can be viewed in the console, helping developers track application behavior and issues.
```
