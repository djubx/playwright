2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save images.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to take pictures.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `ledger_flutter` package, you will typically follow these steps:
1. Import the package in your Dart file:

# Complete Example of ledger_flutter in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ledger_flutter/ledger_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Ledger Example',
      home: LedgerHome(),
    );
  }
}

class LedgerHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _LedgerHomeState createState() => _LedgerHomeState();
}

class _LedgerHomeState extends State<LedgerHome> {
  // Create an instance of Ledger
  final Ledger ledger = Ledger();

  // List to hold transactions
  List<Transaction> transactions = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Load existing transactions from the ledger
    loadTransactions();
  }

  // Function to load transactions
  void loadTransactions() async {
    transactions = await ledger.getTransactions();
    setState(() {});
  }

  // Function to add a new transaction
  void addTransaction(String description, double amount) {
    final transaction = Transaction(description: description, amount: amount);
    ledger.addTransaction(transaction);
    loadTransactions(); // Reload transactions after adding
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Ledger Home'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          Expanded(
            child: ListView.builder(
              itemCount: transactions.length,
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                final transaction = transactions[index];
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text(transaction.description),
                  subtitle: Text('\$${transaction.amount}'),
                );
              },
            ),
          ),
          Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
            child: Row(
              children: [
                Expanded(
                  child: TextField(
                    onSubmitted: (value) {
                      // Add transaction on submit
                      addTransaction(value, 100.0); // Example amount
                    },
                    decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Description'),
                  ),
                ),
                IconButton(
                  icon: Icon(Icons.add),
                  onPressed: () {
                    // Add transaction on button press
                    addTransaction('New Transaction', 100.0); // Example amount
                  },
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and home set to LedgerHome.
// 3. LedgerHome initializes a Ledger instance and loads existing transactions in initState.
// 4. The loadTransactions function fetches transactions from the ledger and updates the state.
// 5. The UI consists of a ListView displaying transactions and a TextField for adding new transactions.
// 6. When a transaction is added, it calls addTransaction, which updates the ledger and reloads the transaction list.
