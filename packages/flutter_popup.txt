# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `flutter_popup`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `flutter_popup` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_popup: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration
For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` file to allow for popups if you are using any specific permissions or features. However, for basic usage, no additional configuration is typically required.

## Step 3: Using the Package

To use the `flutter_popup` package, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_popup/flutter_popup.dart';
```

### Example Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a basic alert popup:

```dart
void showAlert(BuildContext context) {
  FlutterPopup.show(
    context: context,
    title: 'Alert',
    content: 'This is an alert popup!',
    onConfirm: () {
      // Action on confirm
      Navigator.of(context).pop();
    },
  );
}
```

You can call this function from a button's `onPressed` callback to display the alert.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate and use the `flutter_popup` package in your Flutter application effectively.

# Complete Example of `flutter_popup`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_popup/flutter_popup.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Popup Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Popup Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Trigger the alert popup when the button is pressed
              showAlert(context);
            },
            child: Text('Show Alert Popup'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void showAlert(BuildContext context) {
    // Displaying a simple alert popup
    FlutterPopup.show(
      context: context,
      title: 'Alert',
      content: 'This is an alert popup!',
      onConfirm: () {
        // Action on confirm
        Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the popup
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'Flutter Popup Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 5. An ElevatedButton is placed in the center, which, when pressed, calls the showAlert function.
// 6. The showAlert function uses the FlutterPopup package to display an alert popup with a title and content.
// 7. The popup has a confirm button that, when pressed, closes the popup using Navigator.of(context).pop().
```
