<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Google Static Maps Controller Flutter Package

The `google_static_maps_controller` Flutter package is a powerful tool for integrating Google Static Maps into your Flutter applications. This package allows developers to easily display static maps from Google Maps API, providing a simple way to incorporate map visuals without the overhead of interactive map components. 

## When to Use This Package
You might consider using the `google_static_maps_controller` package in scenarios such as:
- Displaying a map as part of a static layout, where interactivity is not required.
- Creating a simple map view for displaying locations, routes, or points of interest.
- Reducing the complexity of your app by avoiding the need for a full-fledged interactive map.

## Features
- **Static Map Generation**: Easily generate static maps using the Google Maps API.
- **Customizable Markers**: Add markers to your maps to highlight specific locations.
- **Dynamic URL Generation**: Create map URLs dynamically based on user input or app state.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

This package is particularly useful for applications that require map visuals without the need for user interaction, making it a lightweight alternative to interactive map solutions.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Google Static Maps Controller

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `google_static_maps_controller` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  google_static_maps_controller: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Configuring API Key
You will need a Google Maps API key to use the static maps feature. Follow these steps to obtain your API key:
1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create a new project or select an existing one.
3. Navigate to the "APIs & Services" section and enable the "Maps Static API".
4. Generate an API key and restrict it to your app's package name and SHA-1 fingerprint for security.

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permission inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

3. Inside the `<application>` tag, add your API key:

```xml
<meta-data
    android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
    android:value="YOUR_API_KEY"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key-value pair:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

3. Ensure you have your API key set up in your app.

## Step 4: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `google_static_maps_controller` in your app.

# Complete Example: Google Static Maps Controller

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:google_static_maps_controller/google_static_maps_controller.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Google Static Maps Example',
      home: MapScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class MapScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  // Define the Google Maps API key
  final String apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Static Map Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: GoogleStaticMap(
          // Set the center of the map
          center: LatLng(37.7749, -122.4194), // San Francisco coordinates
          // Set the zoom level
          zoom: 12,
          // Set the size of the map
          size: Size(600, 300),
          // Set the API key
          apiKey: apiKey,
          // Add a marker at the center
          markers: [
            Marker(
              position: LatLng(37.7749, -122.4194),
              label: 'San Francisco',
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The home screen is defined in the MapScreen widget, which contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body contains a GoogleStaticMap widget, which is configured with the center coordinates, zoom level, size, API key, and markers.
// 5. The map displays a static image of San Francisco with a marker indicating the location.
