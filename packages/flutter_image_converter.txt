<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Flutter Image Converter Package

The `flutter_image_converter` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that simplifies the process of converting images between different formats. This package is particularly useful when you need to manipulate images for various purposes, such as optimizing them for web use, changing formats for compatibility, or preparing images for upload to a server.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the `flutter_image_converter` package in scenarios such as:
- **Image Format Conversion**: When you need to convert images from one format to another (e.g., PNG to JPEG).
- **Image Optimization**: To reduce the file size of images without significantly affecting quality, which is essential for mobile applications.
- **Dynamic Image Processing**: When your app requires real-time image processing, such as applying filters or effects before saving or uploading images.

## Features

- **Multiple Format Support**: Supports various image formats including JPEG, PNG, BMP, and GIF.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that integrates seamlessly with existing Flutter applications.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Designed to handle image processing efficiently, minimizing the impact on app performance.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on both Android and iOS platforms without requiring platform-specific code.

By leveraging the `flutter_image_converter` package, developers can enhance their applications' image handling capabilities, providing a better user experience.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_image_converter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_image_converter` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_image_converter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_image_converter: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to read and write to external storage. Add the following lines inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you need to add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file to request permission for accessing the photo library:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to convert images.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need permission to save converted images to your photo library.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to convert an image from one format to another.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_image_converter/flutter_image_converter.dart';
import 'dart:io';
import 'package:image_picker/image_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Image Converter',
      home: ImageConverterScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ImageConverterScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ImageConverterScreenState createState() => _ImageConverterScreenState();
}

class _ImageConverterScreenState extends State<ImageConverterScreen> {
  File? _imageFile; // Variable to hold the selected image file
  final ImagePicker _picker = ImagePicker(); // Image picker instance

  // Function to pick an image from the gallery
  Future<void> _pickImage() async {
    final pickedFile = await _picker.getImage(source: ImageSource.gallery);
    if (pickedFile != null) {
      setState(() {
        _imageFile = File(pickedFile.path); // Set the selected image file
      });
    }
  }

  // Function to convert the image to JPEG format
  Future<void> _convertImage() async {
    if (_imageFile != null) {
      // Convert the image to JPEG format
      final convertedImage = await FlutterImageConverter.convertImage(
        _imageFile!.path,
        ImageFormat.jpeg,
      );

      // Save the converted image to the device
      final convertedFile = File(convertedImage.path);
      await convertedFile.writeAsBytes(convertedImage.bytes);
      // Notify the user about the successful conversion
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Image converted to JPEG and saved!')),
      );
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Image Converter'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            _imageFile != null
                ? Image.file(_imageFile!) // Display the selected image
                : Text('No image selected.'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _pickImage, // Trigger image picking
              child: Text('Pick Image'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _convertImage, // Trigger image conversion
              child: Text('Convert to JPEG'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The ImageConverterScreen widget is displayed, which contains the UI for image selection and conversion.
// 4. The user can pick an image from the gallery using the 'Pick Image' button.
// 5. Once an image is selected, it is displayed on the screen.
// 6. The user can then click the 'Convert to JPEG' button to convert the selected image to JPEG format.
// 7. After conversion, a message is shown to the user indicating that the image has been successfully converted and saved.
