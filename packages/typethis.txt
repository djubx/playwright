# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Typethis Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **typethis** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  typethis: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` file to allow for necessary permissions, especially if you are using features that require user data.

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to enhance your experience.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a text input field with suggestions.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:typethis/typethis.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Typethis Example')),
        body: TypethisExample(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class TypethisExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _TypethisExampleState createState() => _TypethisExampleState();
}

class _TypethisExampleState extends State<TypethisExample> {
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController();
  List<String> _suggestions = [];

  void _onChanged(String value) {
    // Update suggestions based on user input
    setState(() {
      _suggestions = getSuggestions(value);
    });
  }

  List<String> getSuggestions(String query) {
    // Example static suggestions
    final List<String> allSuggestions = ['apple', 'banana', 'grape', 'orange', 'pineapple'];
    return allSuggestions.where((suggestion) => suggestion.startsWith(query)).toList();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        TextField(
          controller: _controller,
          onChanged: _onChanged,
          decoration: InputDecoration(hintText: 'Type something...'),
        ),
        Expanded(
          child: ListView.builder(
            itemCount: _suggestions.length,
            itemBuilder: (context, index) {
              return ListTile(
                title: Text(_suggestions[index]),
                onTap: () {
                  // Update the text field with the selected suggestion
                  _controller.text = _suggestions[index];
                  setState(() {
                    _suggestions = []; // Clear suggestions after selection
                  });
                },
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Typethis Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:typethis/typethis.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Typethis Example')),
        body: TypethisExample(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class TypethisExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _TypethisExampleState createState() => _TypethisExampleState();
}

class _TypethisExampleState extends State<TypethisExample> {
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController();
  List<String> _suggestions = [];

  void _onChanged(String value) {
    // Update suggestions based on user input
    setState(() {
      _suggestions = getSuggestions(value);
    });
  }

  List<String> getSuggestions(String query) {
    // Example static suggestions
    final List<String> allSuggestions = ['apple', 'banana', 'grape', 'orange', 'pineapple'];
    return allSuggestions.where((suggestion) => suggestion.startsWith(query)).toList();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        TextField(
          controller: _controller,
          onChanged: _onChanged,
          decoration: InputDecoration(hintText: 'Type something...'),
        ),
        Expanded(
          child: ListView.builder(
            itemCount: _suggestions.length,
            itemBuilder: (context, index) {
              return ListTile(
                title: Text(_suggestions[index]),
                onTap: () {
                  // Update the text field with the selected suggestion
                  _controller.text = _suggestions[index];
                  setState(() {
                    _suggestions = []; // Clear suggestions after selection
                  });
                },
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which sets up the MaterialApp and the main scaffold.
// 2. The TypethisExample widget is created, which contains a TextField and a ListView for suggestions.
// 3. When the user types in the TextField, the _onChanged method is triggered, updating the suggestions based on the input.
// 4. The getSuggestions method filters a static list of suggestions based on the user's input.
// 5. The ListView displays the filtered suggestions, and when a suggestion is tapped, it populates the TextField with that suggestion and clears the list of suggestions.
```
