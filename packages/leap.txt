- **Interactive Lists**: Enhance list items with animations that respond to user interactions.
- **Dynamic UI Changes**: Animate changes in the UI when data updates or user actions occur.

## Key Features
- **Smooth Animations**: Provides a variety of pre-built animations that can be easily integrated.
- **Customizable**: Allows developers to customize animations to fit their app's theme.
- **Performance Optimized**: Built with performance in mind, ensuring that animations run smoothly on both iOS and Android devices.

# Setting Up and Using the Leap Package

## Installation
To get started with the Leap package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  leap: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/leap).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the Leap package, you can wrap your widgets with the provided animation classes. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a fade-in animation:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:leap/leap.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Leap Animation Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: LeapFadeIn(
          duration: Duration(seconds: 1),
          child: Text('Hello, Leap!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `LeapFadeIn` widget is used to animate the text "Hello, Leap!" with a fade-in effect over one second.

With these steps, you are now ready to start using the Leap package in your Flutter applications!

# Complete Example of Leap Package in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:leap/leap.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Leap Animation Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // State variable to control the visibility of the animated widget
  bool _isVisible = false;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Leap Animation Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Button to toggle visibility
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Toggle the visibility state
                setState(() {
                  _isVisible = !_isVisible;
                });
              },
              child: Text('Toggle Animation'),
            ),
            // Conditional rendering of the animated widget
            if (_isVisible)
              LeapFadeIn(
                duration: Duration(seconds: 1),
                child: Text(
                  'Hello, Leap!',
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
                ),
              ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and home set to RealFlutter.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that manages its own state.
// 4. The _isVisible boolean controls whether the animated text is shown.
// 5. When the button is pressed, setState is called to toggle _isVisible.
// 6. If _isVisible is true, the LeapFadeIn widget animates the text "Hello, Leap!".
// 7. The animation lasts for one second, providing a smooth transition.
