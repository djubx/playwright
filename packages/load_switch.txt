# Tutorial: Setting Up the Like Button Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To use the **like_button** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  like_button: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install the Package
Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Import the Package
In your Dart file where you want to use the like button, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:like_button/like_button.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Like Button
You can now use the `LikeButton` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
LikeButton(
  size: 40.0,
  isLiked: false,
  onTap: (isLiked) {
    // Handle the like button tap
    return !isLiked; // Toggle the like state
  },
),
```

This code snippet creates a like button that toggles its state when tapped.

## Additional Customization
You can customize the button further by using properties like `likeCount`, `likeBuilder`, and `countBuilder` to display the number of likes and customize the appearance.

# Complete Example of Using the Like Button

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:like_button/like_button.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Like Button Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Like Button Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: LikeButton(
            size: 40.0, // Set the size of the button
            isLiked: false, // Initial state of the button
            likeCount: 0, // Initial like count
            onTap: (isLiked) async {
              // This function is called when the button is tapped
              // Toggle the like state
              return !isLiked; // Return the new state
            },
            likeBuilder: (isLiked) {
              // Customize the appearance of the button based on the like state
              return Icon(
                isLiked ? Icons.thumb_up : Icons.thumb_up_off_alt,
                color: isLiked ? Colors.blue : Colors.grey,
              );
            },
            countBuilder: (count, isLiked, text) {
              // Customize the display of the like count
              return Text(
                count == 0 ? 'Like' : count.toString(),
                style: TextStyle(color: isLiked ? Colors.blue : Colors.black),
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Like Button Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers a LikeButton widget.
// 5. The LikeButton has an initial state of not liked and a like count of 0.
// 6. When the button is tapped, the onTap function toggles the like state.
// 7. The likeBuilder function customizes the button's icon based on whether it is liked or not.
// 8. The countBuilder function displays the like count or 'Like' if there are no likes.
// 9. The app provides a simple interface for users to like or unlike content, with visual feedback.
