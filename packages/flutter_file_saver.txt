# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_file_saver

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the `flutter_file_saver` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_file_saver: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you need to add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file to request permission for file access:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save files.</string>
<key>NSDocumentsFolderUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your documents folder to save files.</string>
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_file_saver/flutter_file_saver.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package
You can now use the `FileSaver` class to save files. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to save a text file:

```dart
void saveFile() async {
  // Create a sample text file
  String fileContent = "Hello, this is a sample text file.";
  // Convert the string to bytes
  List<int> bytes = utf8.encode(fileContent);
  
  // Save the file
  String fileName = "sample.txt";
  String path = await FileSaver.instance.saveFile(fileName, bytes, "txt");
  
  // Notify the user
  print("File saved at: $path");
}
```

This function creates a text file with sample content and saves it to the device's storage.

# Complete Example of Using flutter_file_saver

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_file_saver/flutter_file_saver.dart';
import 'dart:convert'; // For utf8 encoding

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter File Saver Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('File Saver Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: saveFile, // Call the saveFile function on button press
            child: Text('Save File'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to save a file
  void saveFile() async {
    // Create a sample text file content
    String fileContent = "Hello, this is a sample text file.";
    // Convert the string content to bytes
    List<int> bytes = utf8.encode(fileContent);
    
    // Specify the file name
    String fileName = "sample.txt";
    // Save the file and get the path
    String path = await FileSaver.instance.saveFile(fileName, bytes, "txt");
    
    // Notify the user about the saved file location
    print("File saved at: $path");
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a simple UI.
// 3. The UI contains a button labeled "Save File".
// 4. When the button is pressed, the saveFile function is called.
// 5. Inside saveFile, a sample text is created and converted to bytes.
// 6. The FileSaver instance is used to save the file with the specified name and type.
// 7. Finally, the path of the saved file is printed to the console.
