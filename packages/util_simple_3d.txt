# Tutorial

## Setup Process

To get started with the `util_simple_3d` package, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the package dependency:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     util_simple_3d: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the correct configurations. You may need to enable certain features or permissions depending on your use case.
   - **iOS**: Open the `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add any necessary permissions or configurations required for 3D rendering.

4. **Import the Package**: In your Dart files, import the package to start using it:

   ```dart
   import 'package:util_simple_3d/util_simple_3d.dart';
   ```

## Basic Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a 3D cube using the `util_simple_3d` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:util_simple_3d/util_simple_3d.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('3D Cube Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: RealFlutter(), // Your main 3D widget
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, `RealFlutter` is the main class that will handle the 3D rendering.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:util_simple_3d/util_simple_3d.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: '3D Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('3D Cube Example'),
        ),
        body: RealFlutter(), // Main 3D widget
      ),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Initialize the 3D scene
  late Simple3DScene scene;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Create a new 3D scene
    scene = Simple3DScene();
    // Add a cube to the scene
    scene.addCube(
      position: Vector3(0, 0, 0), // Position of the cube
      size: 1.0, // Size of the cube
      color: Colors.blue, // Color of the cube
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      // Set the size of the 3D view
      width: double.infinity,
      height: double.infinity,
      child: scene, // Render the 3D scene
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and the RealFlutter widget.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that initializes a Simple3DScene in its state.
// 4. In the initState method, a cube is added to the scene with specified position, size, and color.
// 5. The build method returns a Container that fills the available space and displays the 3D scene.
```

In this complete example, we have created a simple Flutter application that renders a 3D cube. The application flow is straightforward: it initializes the 3D scene, adds a cube, and displays it within the app's main interface. The comments within the code provide a step-by-step explanation of how the application operates, making it easier for developers to understand and modify the code as needed.
