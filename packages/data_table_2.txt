# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Data Table 2

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `data_table_2` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  data_table_2: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration
For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to create a data table using the `data_table_2` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:data_table_2/data_table_2.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Data Table Example'),
        ),
        body: SingleChildScrollView(
          child: DataTable2(
            columns: [
              DataColumn2(label: Text('ID'), size: ColumnSize.S),
              DataColumn2(label: Text('Name'), size: ColumnSize.L),
              DataColumn2(label: Text('Age'), size: ColumnSize.M),
            ],
            rows: [
              DataRow(cells: [
                DataCell(Text('1')),
                DataCell(Text('Alice')),
                DataCell(Text('30')),
              ]),
              DataRow(cells: [
                DataCell(Text('2')),
                DataCell(Text('Bob')),
                DataCell(Text('25')),
              ]),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple data table with three columns: ID, Name, and Age. The `DataTable2` widget is used to define the structure of the table, and `DataRow` and `DataCell` are used to populate the rows and cells.

# Complete Example of Data Table 2

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:data_table_2/data_table_2.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Data Table Example'),
        ),
        body: SingleChildScrollView(
          child: DataTable2(
            columns: [
              DataColumn2(label: Text('ID'), size: ColumnSize.S), // Column for ID
              DataColumn2(label: Text('Name'), size: ColumnSize.L), // Column for Name
              DataColumn2(label: Text('Age'), size: ColumnSize.M), // Column for Age
            ],
            rows: [
              DataRow(cells: [
                DataCell(Text('1')), // Cell for ID
                DataCell(Text('Alice')), // Cell for Name
                DataCell(Text('30')), // Cell for Age
              ]),
              DataRow(cells: [
                DataCell(Text('2')), // Cell for ID
                DataCell(Text('Bob')), // Cell for Name
                DataCell(Text('25')), // Cell for Age
              ]),
              DataRow(cells: [
                DataCell(Text('3')), // Cell for ID
                DataCell(Text('Charlie')), // Cell for Name
                DataCell(Text('35')), // Cell for Age
              ]),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Entry point of the application
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the Flutter application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the UI.
// 3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// 4. The AppBar displays the title of the application.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains a SingleChildScrollView to allow scrolling.
// 6. The DataTable2 widget is used to create a table with defined columns and rows.
// 7. Each DataColumn2 defines a column in the table, and DataRow defines a row with DataCell for each cell.
// 8. The application displays a simple data table with three entries, allowing users to view the data clearly.
