# Native Device Orientation Flutter Package

The `native_device_orientation` Flutter package is a powerful tool that allows developers to access the device's orientation in a native way. This package is particularly useful for applications that require precise orientation data, such as games, augmented reality (AR) applications, and any app that relies on motion detection.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `native_device_orientation` package when:
- You need real-time updates on the device's orientation.
- Your application involves motion-sensitive features, such as gaming or AR.
- You want to enhance user experience by adapting the UI based on the device's orientation.

## Features

- **Real-time Orientation Updates**: Get continuous updates on the device's orientation.
- **Support for Multiple Platforms**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Customizable Orientation Handling**: Allows developers to define how to handle orientation changes.

Overall, the `native_device_orientation` package is an essential tool for Flutter developers looking to create immersive and responsive applications that react to device movements.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Native Device Orientation Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `native_device_orientation` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  native_device_orientation: ^0.4.0
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Ensure you have the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to request permission for using the device's orientation:

```xml
<key>NSMotionUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to device orientation.</string>
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:native_device_orientation/native_device_orientation.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the package to get the device's orientation. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it in your Flutter app:

```dart
// Create a method to get the current orientation
void getCurrentOrientation() async {
  // Get the current orientation
  NativeDeviceOrientation orientation = await NativeDeviceOrientationCommunicator().getNativeDeviceOrientation();
  // Handle the orientation data
  print('Current Orientation: $orientation');
}
```

This method retrieves the current orientation of the device and prints it to the console.

With these steps, you are now set up to use the `native_device_orientation` package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Using Native Device Orientation

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:native_device_orientation/native_device_orientation.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to hold the current orientation
  NativeDeviceOrientation _currentOrientation;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Start listening to orientation changes
    NativeDeviceOrientationCommunicator().onNativeDeviceOrientationChanged().listen((orientation) {
      setState(() {
        _currentOrientation = orientation; // Update the current orientation
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Native Device Orientation Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(
            'Current Orientation: ${_currentOrientation?.toString() ?? "Unknown"}',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget, we initialize the state and start listening for orientation changes in initState().
// 3. When the orientation changes, the listener updates the _currentOrientation variable.
// 4. The build method rebuilds the UI to display the current orientation.
// 5. The text widget in the center of the screen shows the current orientation, updating in real-time as the device is rotated.
