# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_radio_group

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_radio_group` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_radio_group` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_radio_group: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the platform version in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a radio group.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_radio_group/flutter_radio_group.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Radio Group Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: RadioGroup(
            labels: ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3'],
            onChange: (String? selected) {
              print('Selected: $selected');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with a radio group containing three options. The `onChange` callback is triggered whenever the user selects a different option, allowing you to handle the selection accordingly.

# Complete Example of flutter_radio_group

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_radio_group/flutter_radio_group.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to hold the selected option
  String? selectedOption;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Radio Group Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Display the radio group
              RadioGroup(
                labels: ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3'],
                onChange: (String? selected) {
                  // Update the selected option
                  setState(() {
                    selectedOption = selected;
                  });
                  // Print the selected option to the console
                  print('Selected: $selected');
                },
              ),
              // Display the selected option
              Text(
                selectedOption != null
                    ? 'You selected: $selectedOption'
                    : 'Please select an option',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation

// The application starts by creating a `RealFlutter` widget, which is a StatefulWidget.
// Inside the `_RealFlutterState`, we define a variable `selectedOption` to keep track of the user's selection.
// The `build` method constructs the UI, which includes an AppBar and a Center widget containing a Column.
// The `RadioGroup` widget is used to display three options: 'Option 1', 'Option 2', and 'Option 3'.
// When the user selects an option, the `onChange` callback is triggered, updating the `selectedOption` variable and calling `setState` to refresh the UI.
// Below the radio group, we display the currently selected option or prompt the user to select one.
// Finally, the `main` function runs the app by calling `runApp` with the `RealFlutter` widget.
