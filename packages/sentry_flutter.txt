# Sentry Flutter Package

The `sentry_flutter` package is a powerful tool for integrating Sentry into your Flutter applications. Sentry is an open-source error tracking tool that helps developers monitor and fix crashes in real-time. By using this package, developers can capture and report errors, performance issues, and other important events in their Flutter apps, allowing for a smoother user experience and quicker debugging.

## When to Use Sentry Flutter

You should consider using the `sentry_flutter` package in scenarios such as:

- **Production Applications**: To monitor and track errors that occur in your app after deployment.
- **Debugging**: To gain insights into crashes and performance bottlenecks during development.
- **User Feedback**: To understand how users interact with your app and identify areas for improvement.

## Key Features

- **Error Tracking**: Automatically captures unhandled exceptions and reports them to Sentry.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks performance metrics to identify slow transactions and bottlenecks.
- **Breadcrumbs**: Records events leading up to an error, providing context for debugging.
- **User Feedback**: Allows users to submit feedback directly from the app.
- **Custom Tags and Context**: Enables developers to add custom tags and context to events for better filtering and searching.

With these features, `sentry_flutter` provides a comprehensive solution for monitoring the health of your Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up Sentry in Your Flutter App

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up the `sentry_flutter` package in a Flutter application. 

## Step 1: Add Dependency

First, add the `sentry_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  sentry_flutter: ^7.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Configure Sentry

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure that you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Sentry requires at least API level 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<manifest>
    ...
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
</manifest>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. Ensure that your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Initialize Sentry

In your main Dart file (usually `main.dart`), initialize Sentry in the `main` function:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

void main() async {
  await SentryFlutter.init(
    (options) {
      options.dsn = 'YOUR_SENTRY_DSN'; // Replace with your Sentry DSN
    },
    appRunner: () => runApp(MyApp()),
  );
}
```

## Step 4: Capture Errors

You can capture errors manually using the following code:

```dart
try {
  // Code that may throw an exception
} catch (exception, stackTrace) {
  await Sentry.captureException(
    exception,
    stackTrace: stackTrace,
  );
}
```

## Step 5: Adding Breadcrumbs

You can add breadcrumbs to provide context for errors:

```dart
Sentry.addBreadcrumb(Breadcrumb(
  category: 'ui.click',
  message: 'User clicked the button',
  level: SentryLevel.info,
));
```

With these steps, you have successfully set up Sentry in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Sentry in a Flutter App

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

void main() async {
  // Initialize Sentry with your DSN
  await SentryFlutter.init(
    (options) {
      options.dsn = 'YOUR_SENTRY_DSN'; // Replace with your Sentry DSN
    },
    appRunner: () => runApp(RealFlutter()),
  );
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sentry Flutter Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Sentry Flutter Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Simulate an error
            throw Exception('This is a test exception!');
          },
          child: Text('Trigger Error'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes Sentry with the provided DSN.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is the root of the application, setting up the MaterialApp.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget displays a button that, when pressed, throws a test exception.
// 4. The exception is captured by Sentry, allowing you to monitor and debug the error in your Sentry dashboard.
