# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_resizable_container

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `flutter_resizable_container` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_resizable_container: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_resizable_container/flutter_resizable_container.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Resizable Container

You can now use the `ResizableContainer` widget in your application. Below is a simple example of how to implement it:

### Android and iOS Specific Configurations

For both Android and iOS, no additional configurations are required to use the `flutter_resizable_container` package. However, ensure that your Flutter environment is set up correctly for both platforms.

### Example Usage

Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to use the `ResizableContainer`:

```dart
ResizableContainer(
  minWidth: 100,
  minHeight: 100,
  maxWidth: 400,
  maxHeight: 400,
  child: Container(
    color: Colors.blue,
    child: Center(child: Text('Resize Me!', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white))),
  ),
)
```

This code creates a resizable container with minimum and maximum width and height constraints.

## Step 5: Customizing the Resizable Handles

You can customize the appearance of the resize handles by using the `handleColor` and `handleSize` properties:

```dart
ResizableContainer(
  handleColor: Colors.red,
  handleSize: 10.0,
  // Other properties...
)
```

This customization allows you to match the handles with your app's theme.

With these steps, you are now ready to implement the `flutter_resizable_container` package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of flutter_resizable_container

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_resizable_container/flutter_resizable_container.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Resizable Container Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Resizable Container Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ResizableContainer(
            minWidth: 100, // Minimum width of the container
            minHeight: 100, // Minimum height of the container
            maxWidth: 400, // Maximum width of the container
            maxHeight: 400, // Maximum height of the container
            handleColor: Colors.red, // Color of the resize handles
            handleSize: 10.0, // Size of the resize handles
            child: Container(
              color: Colors.blue, // Background color of the container
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'Resize Me!',
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Resizable Container Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers a ResizableContainer widget.
// 5. The ResizableContainer has defined minimum and maximum dimensions, allowing users to resize it.
// 6. Inside the ResizableContainer, a blue Container is created with centered text 'Resize Me!'.
// 7. The user can drag the edges of the ResizableContainer to change its size, demonstrating the package's functionality.
