# Tutorial: Setting Up GetWidget

## Step 1: Adding GetWidget to Your Project

To use GetWidget in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  getwidget: ^2.0.4  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration
For iOS, you may need to set the platform version in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing GetWidget

In your Dart files, import the GetWidget package:

```dart
import 'package:getwidget/getwidget.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using GetWidget Widgets

You can now start using GetWidget widgets in your Flutter application. For example, to create a simple button, you can use the `GFButton` widget as follows:

```dart
GFButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // Your action here
  },
  text: "Click Me",
  shape: GFButtonShape.pills,
);
```

This button can be customized with various properties such as color, size, and shape.

## Conclusion

With these steps, you have successfully set up the GetWidget package in your Flutter project. You can now explore the various widgets it offers and start building beautiful UIs with ease.

# Complete Example: Using GetWidget in a Flutter App

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:getwidget/getwidget.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'GetWidget Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('GetWidget Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Using GFButton from GetWidget
              GFButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Action when button is pressed
                  print("Button Pressed!");
                },
                text: "Click Me",
                shape: GFButtonShape.pills,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between widgets
              // Using GFCard to display information
              GFCard(
                content: Column(
                  children: <Widget>[
                    Text(
                      "GetWidget Card",
                      style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
                    ),
                    SizedBox(height: 10),
                    Text("This is a simple card using GetWidget."),
                  ],
                ),
                title: GFListTile(
                  title: Text("Card Title"),
                  subtitle: Text("Subtitle of the card"),
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "GetWidget Demo".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Column widget.
// 5. Inside the Column, a GFButton is created, which prints a message when pressed.
// 6. A SizedBox is used to add space between the button and the card.
// 7. A GFCard is created to display a title and some text, showcasing the card widget from GetWidget.
// 8. The app demonstrates the use of both GFButton and GFCard, highlighting the ease of use of GetWidget.
