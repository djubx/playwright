# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Size Helper

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **size_helper** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and include the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  size_helper: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the package to start using its features:

```dart
import 'package:size_helper/size_helper.dart';
```

## Step 4: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 5: Using Size Helper in Your App

You can now use the **size_helper** package to create responsive layouts. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use it:

```dart
// Example usage of Size Helper
double responsiveWidth = SizeHelper.getResponsiveWidth(context, 0.5); // 50% of screen width
double responsiveHeight = SizeHelper.getResponsiveHeight(context, 0.3); // 30% of screen height
```

With these steps, you are now ready to utilize the **size_helper** package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Size Helper in a Flutter App

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:size_helper/size_helper.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Initialize SizeHelper with the context
    SizeHelper.init(context);

    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Size Helper Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Size Helper Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Using SizeHelper to set responsive width and height
              Container(
                width: SizeHelper.getResponsiveWidth(context, 0.8), // 80% of screen width
                height: SizeHelper.getResponsiveHeight(context, 0.2), // 20% of screen height
                color: Colors.blue,
                child: Center(
                  child: Text(
                    'Responsive Container',
                    style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
                  ),
                ),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between widgets
              // Using SizeHelper for padding
              Padding(
                padding: EdgeInsets.all(SizeHelper.getResponsiveWidth(context, 0.05)), // 5% padding
                child: Text(
                  'This text is padded responsively!',
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18),
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget initializes SizeHelper with the current context.
// 3. The MaterialApp widget is created with a title and a home scaffold.
// 4. Inside the scaffold, a Center widget is used to center the content vertically and horizontally.
// 5. A Column widget is used to stack the children vertically.
// 6. The first child is a Container that uses SizeHelper to set its width and height responsively.
// 7. The second child is a SizedBox that adds space between the Container and the Text widget.
// 8. The Text widget is padded using SizeHelper to ensure consistent spacing across devices.
