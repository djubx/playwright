# Complete Example of Using `slider_button` in Flutter

Below is a complete Flutter application demonstrating the use of the `slider_button` package. This example includes detailed comments to explain each part of the code.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:slider_button/slider_button.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Slider Button Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: SliderButtonDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class SliderButtonDemo extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Slider Button Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: SliderButton(
          action: () {
            // This function is called when the slider is successfully slid
            print("Slider button activated!");
            // You can navigate to another screen or perform any action here
          },
          label: Text(
            "Slide to confirm",
            style: TextStyle(
              color: Color(0xff4a4a4a),
              fontWeight: FontWeight.w500,
              fontSize: 17,
            ),
          ),
          icon: Icon(
            Icons.chevron_right,
            color: Colors.white,
          ),
          width: 230,
          height: 60,
          buttonColor: Colors.blue,
          backgroundColor: Colors.grey[300],
          highlightedColor: Colors.white,
          baseColor: Colors.blue,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The application starts by running the `RealFlutter` class.
// `RealFlutter` is a stateless widget that sets up the MaterialApp.
// The home of the app is `SliderButtonDemo`, which is another stateless widget.
// `SliderButtonDemo` builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a centered `SliderButton`.
// The `SliderButton` widget is configured with an action that prints a message when activated.
// The button's appearance is customized with colors and an icon.
// The app demonstrates a simple use case of the `slider_button` package, providing a clear and interactive UI element.
