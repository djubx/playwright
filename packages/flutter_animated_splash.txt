# Tutorial: Setting Up flutter_animated_splash

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_animated_splash` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_animated_splash` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_animated_splash: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Configuring Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file is set up correctly. You may want to set the theme for your splash screen. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following lines within the `<application>` tag:

```xml
<activity
    android:name=".MainActivity"
    android:theme="@style/LaunchTheme">
    ...
</activity>
```

You can define `LaunchTheme` in your `styles.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/res/values/styles.xml`:

```xml
<resources>
    <style name="LaunchTheme" parent="Theme.AppCompat.NoActionBar">
        <item name="android:windowBackground">@drawable/splash</item>
    </style>
</resources>
```

Make sure to create a drawable resource for your splash screen image.

## Step 3: Configuring iOS

For iOS, you need to set the launch screen in your `Info.plist` file. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>UILaunchStoryboardName</key>
<string>LaunchScreen</string>
```

You can customize the `LaunchScreen.storyboard` file located in `ios/Runner` to design your splash screen.

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Below is an example of how to implement the animated splash screen.

# Complete Example of flutter_animated_splash

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_animated_splash/flutter_animated_splash.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Animated Splash Demo',
      home: AnimatedSplashScreen(
        splash: Icons.flutter_dash, // Icon to display during splash
        nextScreen: HomeScreen(), // Screen to navigate after splash
        splashTransition: SplashTransition.scaleTransition, // Animation type
        duration: 3000, // Duration of the splash screen
        backgroundColor: Colors.blue, // Background color of the splash screen
      ),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to the Home Screen!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and an AnimatedSplashScreen.
// 3. The AnimatedSplashScreen displays an icon (Icons.flutter_dash) for 3000 milliseconds.
// 4. After the duration, it transitions to the HomeScreen using a scale transition.
// 5. The HomeScreen displays a simple welcome message in the center of the screen.
