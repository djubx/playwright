# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Stylish Dialog

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the **stylish_dialog** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  stylish_dialog: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the dialog, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:stylish_dialog/stylish_dialog.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Dialog

You can now use the **stylish_dialog** package to create and display dialogs. Below is an example of how to create a simple alert dialog:

```dart
StylishDialog(
  title: 'Alert',
  description: 'This is a stylish alert dialog.',
  positiveButtonText: 'OK',
  onPositiveButtonPressed: () {
    // Handle the positive button action
  },
).show(context);
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` file to allow for certain permissions if your dialog requires them (e.g., camera access). Add the necessary keys as needed.

## Optimizations

- **Performance**: Ensure that you are not blocking the main thread when showing dialogs. Use asynchronous operations if necessary.
- **Testing**: Test the dialogs on different devices and screen sizes to ensure they are responsive and visually appealing.

# Complete Example of Stylish Dialog

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:stylish_dialog/stylish_dialog.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Stylish Dialog Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Stylish Dialog Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Show the stylish dialog when the button is pressed
              StylishDialog(
                title: 'Welcome',
                description: 'This is a stylish dialog example.',
                positiveButtonText: 'Continue',
                negativeButtonText: 'Cancel',
                onPositiveButtonPressed: () {
                  // Action for the positive button
                  Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                },
                onNegativeButtonPressed: () {
                  // Action for the negative button
                  Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                },
              ).show(context);
            },
            child: Text('Show Dialog'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'Stylish Dialog Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child, an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, a StylishDialog is created and displayed.
// 6. The dialog has a title, description, and two buttons: 'Continue' and 'Cancel'.
// 7. Pressing 'Continue' or 'Cancel' will close the dialog by calling Navigator.of(context).pop().
```
