# Setting Up and Using the Flutter UnionAd Package

## Installation
To get started with `flutter_unionad`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_unionad: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_unionad).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Add the necessary permissions and metadata for ad services.
   ```xml
   <manifest>
       <application>
           <meta-data
               android:name="com.google.android.gms.ads.APPLICATION_ID"
               android:value="YOUR_ADMOB_APP_ID"/>
       </application>
   </manifest>
   ```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure your `build.gradle` files are set up correctly to include the required dependencies.

### iOS
1. **Update Info.plist**: Add the necessary keys for ad services.
   ```xml
   <key>GADApplicationIdentifier</key>
   <string>YOUR_ADMOB_APP_ID</string>
   ```

2. **CocoaPods**: Make sure to run `pod install` in the `ios` directory after adding the package.

## Basic Usage
Once the package is installed and configured, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to display a banner ad.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_unionad/flutter_unionad.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('UnionAd Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              Text('Welcome to UnionAd Example!'),
              UnionAdBanner(
                adUnitId: 'YOUR_BANNER_AD_UNIT_ID',
                listener: (event) {
                  // Handle ad events here
                },
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that displays a banner ad. The `UnionAdBanner` widget takes an `adUnitId` and a listener for handling ad events.

With this setup, you are ready to start integrating ads into your Flutter application using the `flutter_unionad` package.

                listener: (event) {
                  // Handle ad events such as loading, error, etc.
                  if (event == UnionAdEvent.loaded) {
                    print('Banner Ad Loaded');
                  } else if (event == UnionAdEvent.error) {
                    print('Error loading Banner Ad');
                  }
                },
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Show interstitial ad on button press
                  UnionAdInterstitial.show(
                    adUnitId: 'YOUR_INTERSTITIAL_AD_UNIT_ID',
                    listener: (event) {
                      if (event == UnionAdEvent.closed) {
                        print('Interstitial Ad Closed');
                      }
                    },
                  );
                },
                child: Text('Show Interstitial Ad'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
// The above code creates a Flutter application that integrates the flutter_unionad package.
// 1. The app starts with a MaterialApp and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 2. Inside the Center widget, we have a Column that displays a welcome message and a banner ad.
// 3. The UnionAdBanner widget is used to display a banner ad, with an adUnitId provided.
// 4. A listener is attached to handle ad events, such as when the ad is loaded or if there is an error.
// 5. Below the banner ad, there is a button that, when pressed, shows an interstitial ad.
// 6. The UnionAdInterstitial.show method is called with an adUnitId and a listener to handle the ad's closure event.
// This example demonstrates how to integrate both banner and interstitial ads using the flutter_unionad package.
