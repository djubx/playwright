# Setting Up whisper_flutter_plus

To get started with the `whisper_flutter_plus` package, follow these steps:

## Installation

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the package:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     whisper_flutter_plus: ^latest_version
   ```

   Replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/whisper_flutter_plus).

2. **Run Flutter Packages Get**: After saving the `pubspec.yaml`, run the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. **Permissions**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

2. **Minimum SDK Version**: Make sure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS
1. **Permissions**: Add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file to request microphone access:

   ```xml
   <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your microphone for voice recognition.</string>
   ```

2. **Deployment Target**: Ensure your iOS deployment target is set to at least 11.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '11.0'
   ```

## Using the Package

Once the package is installed and configured, you can start using it in your Flutter application. 

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:whisper_flutter_plus/whisper_flutter_plus.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _transcription = "Press the button and start speaking!";
  WhisperFlutterPlus _whisper = WhisperFlutterPlus();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _whisper.onTranscription.listen((transcription) {
      setState(() {
        _transcription = transcription;
      });
    });
  }

  void _startListening() async {
    await _whisper.startListening();
  }

  void _stopListening() async {
    await _whisper.stopListening();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Whisper Flutter Plus Example")),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text(_transcription),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _startListening,
              child: Text("Start Listening"),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _stopListening,
              child: Text("Stop Listening"),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of whisper_flutter_plus

Here is a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the `whisper_flutter_plus` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:whisper_flutter_plus/whisper_flutter_plus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _transcription = "Press the button and start speaking!";
  WhisperFlutterPlus _whisper = WhisperFlutterPlus();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Listen for transcription updates
    _whisper.onTranscription.listen((transcription) {
      setState(() {
        _transcription = transcription; // Update the transcription text
      });
    });
  }

  void _startListening() async {
    // Start the voice recognition process
    await _whisper.startListening();
  }

  void _stopListening() async {
    // Stop the voice recognition process
    await _whisper.stopListening();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Whisper Flutter Plus Example")),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text(_transcription), // Display the transcription
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _startListening, // Button to start listening
              child: Text("Start Listening"),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _stopListening, // Button to stop listening
              child: Text("Stop Listening"),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which initializes the WhisperFlutterPlus instance.
// 3. In the initState method, the app listens for transcription updates from the Whisper package.
// 4. When the user presses the "Start Listening" button, the app starts capturing audio.
// 5. The captured audio is transcribed in real-time, and the transcription is displayed on the screen.
// 6. The user can stop the transcription process by pressing the "Stop Listening" button.
// 7. The app updates the UI with the latest transcription whenever new data is received.
