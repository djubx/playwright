# flutter_value_state Package Overview

The `flutter_value_state` package is a lightweight state management solution for Flutter applications. It provides a simple way to manage and react to changes in state, making it easier for developers to build responsive and dynamic user interfaces. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to manage simple state changes without the overhead of more complex state management solutions like Provider or Bloc.

## When to Use flutter_value_state

- **Simple State Management**: Ideal for applications that require straightforward state management without the complexity of larger frameworks.
- **Reactive UI**: When you want your UI to react to state changes seamlessly.
- **Lightweight Applications**: Perfect for small to medium-sized applications where performance and simplicity are key.

## Key Features

- **Reactive State Management**: Automatically rebuilds widgets when the state changes.
- **Lightweight**: Minimalistic design with no unnecessary overhead.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple API that is easy to integrate into existing Flutter applications.
- **No Boilerplate Code**: Reduces the amount of boilerplate code typically associated with state management.

Overall, `flutter_value_state` is a great choice for developers looking for a straightforward and efficient way to manage state in their Flutter applications.

# flutter_value_state Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation

To get started with `flutter_value_state`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_value_state: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_value_state).

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

No specific configurations are required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 9.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
```

## Basic Usage

To use `flutter_value_state`, you need to create a class that extends `ValueState`. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_value_state/flutter_value_state.dart';

class RealFlutter extends ValueState<int> {
  RealFlutter() : super(0); // Initial state is 0

  void increment() {
    value++; // Increment the state value
  }
}
```

In your widget, you can use the `ValueBuilder` to listen for changes:

```dart
class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  final RealFlutter state = RealFlutter();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Value State Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ValueBuilder<int>(
          valueState: state,
          builder: (context, value) {
            return Text('Current Value: $value');
          },
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: state.increment,
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This setup allows you to manage and display a simple integer state that increments when the floating action button is pressed.

# Complete Example of flutter_value_state

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_value_state/flutter_value_state.dart';

// Step 1: Create a class that extends ValueState to manage the integer state
class RealFlutter extends ValueState<int> {
  RealFlutter() : super(0); // Initial state is set to 0

  // Step 2: Method to increment the state value
  void increment() {
    value++; // Increments the current value
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// Step 3: Create the main application widget
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Value State Example',
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

// Step 4: Create a StatefulWidget to manage the UI
class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  final RealFlutter state = RealFlutter(); // Instantiate the state management class

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Value State Example')),
      body: Center(
        // Step 5: Use ValueBuilder to listen for state changes
        child: ValueBuilder<int>(
          valueState: state,
          builder: (context, value) {
            return Text('Current Value: $value'); // Display the current value
          },
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: state.increment, // Call increment method on button press
        child: Icon(Icons.add), // Floating action button icon
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Step 6: Explanation of the application flow
// - The application starts with the main() function, which runs MyApp.
// - MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and home page.
// - MyHomePage creates an instance of RealFlutter to manage the integer state.
// - The UI consists of a Text widget that displays the current value and a FloatingActionButton.
// - When the button is pressed, the increment method is called, updating the state.
// - ValueBuilder listens for changes in the state and rebuilds the Text widget with the new value.
```

```

### Summary of Application Flow
The application initializes with a state value of 0. When the user presses the floating action button, the `increment` method is called, which increases the state value by 1. The `ValueBuilder` widget listens for changes in the state and automatically rebuilds the UI to reflect the updated value. This creates a responsive and dynamic user experience with minimal boilerplate code.
