# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Auto Animated List Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `auto_animated_list` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  auto_animated_list: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter and the package:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # Ensure this is set to at least 10.0
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement an animated list.

# Complete Example of Using Auto Animated List

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:auto_animated_list/auto_animated_list.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Auto Animated List Example',
      home: AnimatedListExample(),
    );
  }
}

class AnimatedListExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _AnimatedListExampleState createState() => _AnimatedListExampleState();
}

class _AnimatedListExampleState extends State<AnimatedListExample> {
  // List to hold the items
  final List<String> _items = [];
  final GlobalKey<AnimatedListState> _listKey = GlobalKey<AnimatedListState>();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Auto Animated List'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          Expanded(
            child: AnimatedList(
              key: _listKey,
              initialItemCount: _items.length,
              itemBuilder: (context, index, animation) {
                return _buildItem(_items[index], animation);
              },
            ),
          ),
          // Button to add new items
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: _addItem,
            child: Text('Add Item'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }

  // Method to build each item with animation
  Widget _buildItem(String item, Animation<double> animation) {
    return SizeTransition(
      sizeFactor: animation,
      child: Card(
        margin: EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
        child: ListTile(
          title: Text(item),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Method to add a new item to the list
  void _addItem() {
    final newIndex = _items.length;
    _items.add('Item ${newIndex + 1}');
    _listKey.currentState?.insertItem(newIndex);
  }
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation

// The main function initializes the app and runs the RealFlutter widget.
// RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home widget.
// AnimatedListExample is a StatefulWidget that manages the state of the animated list.
// Inside the AnimatedListExample, we define a list of items and a GlobalKey for the AnimatedList.
// The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and an AnimatedList.
// The AnimatedList uses the _buildItem method to create each item with a SizeTransition animation.
// The ElevatedButton allows users to add new items to the list.
// The _addItem method adds a new item to the _items list and triggers the animation for the new item.
// Each item is displayed in a Card with a ListTile, providing a clean and modern look.

In summary, the `auto_animated_list` package provides an easy way to create animated lists in Flutter applications. By following the setup and usage instructions, developers can enhance their apps with smooth animations that improve user engagement and experience.
