# Tutorial: Setting Up Paymob Pakistan in Your Flutter App

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **paymob_pakistan** package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the **paymob_pakistan** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  paymob_pakistan: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Configure for Android

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

2. **Enable ProGuard**: If you are using ProGuard, ensure that you add the necessary rules to keep the Paymob classes.

## Step 3: Configure for iOS

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. **CocoaPods**: Ensure that your iOS project is using the latest version of CocoaPods. Run the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   pod install
   ```

## Step 4: Initialize the Package

In your main Dart file, import the package and initialize it:

```dart
import 'package:paymob_pakistan/paymob_pakistan.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
  PaymobPakistan.initialize(apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY');
}
```

## Step 5: Implement Payment

You can now implement the payment functionality in your app. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initiate a payment:

```dart
void initiatePayment() async {
  try {
    final response = await PaymobPakistan.startPayment(
      amount: 1000, // Amount in the smallest currency unit (e.g., paisa)
      currency: 'PKR',
      orderId: '12345',
    );
    // Handle the response
  } catch (e) {
    // Handle error
  }
}
```

With these steps, you have successfully set up the **paymob_pakistan** package in your Flutter application. You can now start processing payments securely and efficiently.

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:paymob_pakistan/paymob_pakistan.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
  // Initialize Paymob with your API key

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Paymob Pakistan Example',
      home: PaymentScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PaymentScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Paymob Payment'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Initiate payment when button is pressed
            initiatePayment();
          },
          child: Text('Pay Now'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void initiatePayment() async {
    try {
      // Start the payment process
      final response = await PaymobPakistan.startPayment(
        amount: 1000, // Amount in the smallest currency unit (e.g., paisa)
        currency: 'PKR',
        orderId: '12345',
      );
      // Handle successful payment response
      print('Payment successful: $response');
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle payment error
      print('Payment error: $e');
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and initializes the Paymob Pakistan package with the provided API key.
// 2. The main screen displays a button labeled "Pay Now."
// 3. When the user presses the button, the `initiatePayment` function is called.
// 4. This function attempts to start the payment process with the specified amount and currency.
// 5. If the payment is successful, the response is printed to the console.
// 6. If there is an error during the payment process, the error is caught and printed to the console.
