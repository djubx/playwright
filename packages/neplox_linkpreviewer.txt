# Complete Example of neplox_linkpreviewer

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:neplox_linkpreviewer/neplox_linkpreviewer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Link Previewer Example',
      home: LinkPreviewScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class LinkPreviewScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _LinkPreviewScreenState createState() => _LinkPreviewScreenState();
}

class _LinkPreviewScreenState extends State<LinkPreviewScreen> {
  // URL to preview
  final String url = 'https://flutter.dev';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Link Previewer'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: FutureBuilder(
          // Fetching link preview data
          future: LinkPreview.fetch(url),
          builder: (context, snapshot) {
            if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
              // While waiting for data, show a loading indicator
              return CircularProgressIndicator();
            } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
              // If there's an error, display it
              return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}');
            } else {
              // If data is fetched successfully, display the link preview
              final previewData = snapshot.data;
              return Column(
                mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
                children: [
                  // Displaying the title of the link
                  Text(previewData.title, style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold)),
                  SizedBox(height: 10),
                  // Displaying the description of the link
                  Text(previewData.description),
                  SizedBox(height: 10),
                  // Displaying the image of the link
                  Image.network(previewData.imageUrl),
                ],
              );
            }
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (LinkPreviewScreen).
// 3. LinkPreviewScreen is a stateful widget that fetches link preview data for a specified URL.
// 4. In the build method, a FutureBuilder is used to handle the asynchronous fetching of link preview data.
// 5. While waiting for the data, a CircularProgressIndicator is displayed.
// 6. If an error occurs during fetching, it is displayed as text.
// 7. Once the data is successfully fetched, the title, description, and image of the link are displayed in a column.
