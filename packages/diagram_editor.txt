# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Diagram Editor Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **diagram_editor** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  diagram_editor: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/diagram_editor).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

After making these changes, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that the package is set up, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the **diagram_editor** in your app.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:diagram_editor/diagram_editor.dart';
```

2. Create a widget that uses the `DiagramEditor` class:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Diagram Editor Example'),
      ),
      body: DiagramEditor(
        // Add your diagram configuration here
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Run your application using `flutter run`.

This basic setup will display a diagram editor within your Flutter application. You can further customize the `DiagramEditor` widget by adding shapes, enabling zoom, and more.

# Complete Example of Diagram Editor in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:diagram_editor/diagram_editor.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Diagram Editor Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Initialize the diagram editor controller
  final DiagramEditorController _controller = DiagramEditorController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Diagram Editor Example'),
        actions: [
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.save),
            onPressed: () {
              // Save the diagram as an image
              _controller.exportDiagram();
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
      body: DiagramEditor(
        controller: _controller,
        onDiagramChanged: (diagram) {
          // Handle diagram changes
          print('Diagram updated: $diagram');
        },
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          // Add a new shape to the diagram
          _controller.addShape(ShapeType.rectangle);
        },
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets up the MaterialApp widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is the home screen, which contains the DiagramEditor.
// 3. The DiagramEditor is controlled by a DiagramEditorController, allowing for interaction.
// 4. The AppBar includes a save button to export the diagram and a floating action button to add new shapes.
// 5. When the user adds a shape, it is added to the diagram, and any changes are printed to the console.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application that utilizes the **diagram_editor** package. The application allows users to add shapes to a diagram and export the diagram as an image. The flow of the application is straightforward, with a clear separation of concerns and a user-friendly interface.

### Summary of Application Flow
- The application starts with the `main` function, which initializes the Flutter app.
- The `RealFlutter` widget serves as the main screen, containing the `DiagramEditor`.
- The `DiagramEditor` is controlled by a `DiagramEditorController`, which manages the state and interactions.
- Users can add shapes using the floating action button, and changes to the diagram are logged in the console.
- The save button in the AppBar allows users to export the current diagram.
