# Nostr Flutter Package: A Comprehensive Overview

The **nostr** Flutter package is designed to facilitate the integration of the Nostr protocol into Flutter applications. Nostr (Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays) is a decentralized protocol that allows users to communicate and share data in a secure and censorship-resistant manner. This package is particularly useful for developers looking to build applications that prioritize user privacy and data ownership.

## When to Use Nostr
- **Decentralized Applications**: If you're building an app that requires decentralized communication, such as social media platforms or messaging apps.
- **Privacy-Focused Solutions**: Ideal for applications that prioritize user privacy and data security.
- **Real-Time Data Sharing**: Useful for applications that need to share data in real-time without relying on centralized servers.

## Key Features
- **Decentralized Communication**: Leverages the Nostr protocol for peer-to-peer communication.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Supports real-time data updates through WebSocket connections.
- **User Authentication**: Provides mechanisms for user authentication and identity management.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

# Nostr Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the **nostr** package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  nostr: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/nostr).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21.
2. Add the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

This allows your app to make network requests to non-secure HTTP endpoints, which may be necessary depending on your Nostr relay configuration.

## Basic Usage
Once the package is installed and configured, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to initialize a connection to a Nostr relay and send a message.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:nostr/nostr.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late NostrClient _nostrClient;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the Nostr client
    _nostrClient = NostrClient(relayUrl: 'wss://your.relay.url');
    // Connect to the relay
    _nostrClient.connect();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Disconnect from the relay when the widget is disposed
    _nostrClient.disconnect();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Nostr Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Send a message to the relay
            _nostrClient.sendMessage('Hello, Nostr!');
          },
          child: Text('Send Message'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code initializes a Nostr client, connects to a relay, and provides a button to send a message.

# Complete Example of Nostr Flutter Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:nostr/nostr.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late NostrClient _nostrClient; // Declare the Nostr client
  String _message = ''; // Variable to hold the message

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the Nostr client with a relay URL
    _nostrClient = NostrClient(relayUrl: 'wss://your.relay.url');
    // Connect to the relay
    _nostrClient.connect();
    // Listen for incoming messages
    _nostrClient.onMessageReceived = (message) {
      setState(() {
        _message = message; // Update the message state when a new message is received
      });
    };
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Disconnect from the relay when the widget is disposed
    _nostrClient.disconnect();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Nostr Example')),
      body: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: [
          Text('Received Message: $_message'), // Display the received message
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Send a message to the relay
              _nostrClient.sendMessage('Hello, Nostr!');
            },
            child: Text('Send Message'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(home: RealFlutter()));
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation
// The application starts by initializing the Nostr client with a specified relay URL.
// In the `initState` method, the client connects to the relay and sets up a listener for incoming messages.
// When a message is received, the state is updated, and the UI reflects the new message.
// The user can send a message by pressing the "Send Message" button, which triggers the `sendMessage` method of the Nostr client.
// The application is structured to ensure that the client disconnects properly when the widget is disposed, preventing memory leaks.
