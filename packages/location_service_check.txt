# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Location Service Check

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `location_service_check` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `location_service_check` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  location_service_check: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request location permissions:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to provide better services.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to provide better services.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to check the location service status.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:location_service_check/location_service_check.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: LocationCheckScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class LocationCheckScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _LocationCheckScreenState createState() => _LocationCheckScreenState();
}

class _LocationCheckScreenState extends State<LocationCheckScreen> {
  String _locationStatus = "Checking location services...";

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _checkLocationService();
  }

  Future<void> _checkLocationService() async {
    bool isLocationServiceEnabled = await LocationServiceCheck.isLocationServiceEnabled();
    setState(() {
      _locationStatus = isLocationServiceEnabled ? "Location services are enabled." : "Location services are disabled.";
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Location Service Check")),
      body: Center(child: Text(_locationStatus)),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Location Service Check

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:location_service_check/location_service_check.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: LocationCheckScreen(), // Main screen of the app
    );
  }
}

class LocationCheckScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _LocationCheckScreenState createState() => _LocationCheckScreenState();
}

class _LocationCheckScreenState extends State<LocationCheckScreen> {
  String _locationStatus = "Checking location services..."; // Initial status message

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _checkLocationService(); // Check location service status on initialization
  }

  // Function to check if location services are enabled
  Future<void> _checkLocationService() async {
    bool isLocationServiceEnabled = await LocationServiceCheck.isLocationServiceEnabled();
    setState(() {
      // Update the status message based on the location service status
      _locationStatus = isLocationServiceEnabled ? "Location services are enabled." : "Location services are disabled.";
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Location Service Check")), // App bar title
      body: Center(child: Text(_locationStatus)), // Display the location status
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The LocationCheckScreen is displayed as the home screen.
// 3. In the LocationCheckScreen, the _checkLocationService function is called during initialization.
// 4. This function checks if location services are enabled using the package's method.
// 5. The status message is updated based on the result, and the UI reflects this status.
```
