# Setting Up and Using pdf_viewer_flutter

## Installation
To get started with the `pdf_viewer_flutter` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  pdf_viewer_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/pdf_viewer_flutter).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    compileSdkVersion 31 // or latest
    ...
}
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions to allow file access:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to select PDF files.</string>
<key>NSDocumentsFolderUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your documents to display PDF files.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `pdf_viewer_flutter` package, you can create a simple widget that loads a PDF file from assets or a URL. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pdf_viewer_flutter/pdf_viewer_flutter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('PDF Viewer Example')),
        body: PDFViewer(
          filePath: 'assets/sample.pdf', // Path to your PDF file
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application with a PDF viewer that loads a PDF file from the assets folder. Make sure to add the PDF file to your `pubspec.yaml` under the assets section.

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/sample.pdf
```

Now you can run your application, and it should display the PDF document.

# Complete Example of pdf_viewer_flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pdf_viewer_flutter/pdf_viewer_flutter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('PDF Viewer Example')),
        body: PDFViewer(
          filePath: 'assets/sample.pdf', // Path to your PDF file
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Start the application with RealFlutter widget
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The runApp function takes the RealFlutter widget and starts the app.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 4. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'PDF Viewer Example'.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains the PDFViewer widget.
// 6. The PDFViewer widget loads the PDF file specified in the filePath.
// 7. The PDF file is displayed in the app, allowing users to scroll and zoom.
