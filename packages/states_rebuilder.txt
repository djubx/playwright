# Understanding the `states_rebuilder` Flutter Package

The `states_rebuilder` package is a powerful state management solution for Flutter applications. It provides a reactive programming model that allows developers to manage state efficiently and intuitively. This package is particularly useful when building complex applications that require a robust and scalable state management solution.

## When to Use `states_rebuilder`

- **Complex State Management**: Ideal for applications with complex state management needs, where multiple widgets need to react to state changes.
- **Performance Optimization**: Helps in optimizing performance by rebuilding only the widgets that need to be updated.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Encourages a clean architecture by separating business logic from UI code.

## Key Features

- **Reactive Programming**: Allows for a reactive approach to state management, making it easy to manage and update state across the application.
- **Dependency Injection**: Built-in support for dependency injection, which simplifies the management of dependencies.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Provides tools to handle asynchronous operations seamlessly.
- **Testability**: Enhances testability by allowing state to be easily mocked and tested.

# Setting Up and Using `states_rebuilder` in Your Flutter Project

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `states_rebuilder` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Setup Process

1. **Add Dependency**: Add `states_rebuilder` to your `pubspec.yaml` file.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     states_rebuilder: ^3.2.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**: No additional platform-specific configurations are required for Android and iOS. The package is designed to work seamlessly across platforms.

## Using `states_rebuilder`

1. **Create a State Class**: Define a class to hold your application state.

   ```dart
   class CounterState {
     int counter = 0;
     void increment() => counter++;
   }
   ```

2. **Initialize State**: Use `Injector` to provide the state to your application.

   ```dart
   Injector(
     inject: [Inject(() => CounterState())],
     builder: (context) => MyApp(),
   );
   ```

3. **Access and Update State**: Use `StateBuilder` to access and update the state.

   ```dart
   StateBuilder<CounterState>(
     observe: () => RM.get<CounterState>(),
     builder: (context, model) => Text('Counter: ${model.state.counter}'),
   );
   ```

4. **Trigger State Changes**: Use `setState` to trigger state changes.

   ```dart
   model.setState((state) => state.increment());
   ```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:states_rebuilder/states_rebuilder.dart';

// Define the main class for the application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Injector(
      inject: [Inject(() => CounterState())], // Injecting the CounterState
      builder: (context) => MaterialApp(
        home: CounterPage(), // Setting the home page of the app
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Define a simple state class to manage the counter
class CounterState {
  int counter = 0; // Initial counter value

  // Method to increment the counter
  void increment() => counter++;
}

// Define the main page of the application
class CounterPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Counter App')), // App bar with title
      body: Center(
        child: StateBuilder<CounterState>(
          observe: () => RM.get<CounterState>(), // Observing the CounterState
          builder: (context, model) => Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text('You have pushed the button this many times:'),
              Text(
                '${model.state.counter}', // Displaying the current counter value
                style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline4,
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          // Increment the counter when the button is pressed
          RM.get<CounterState>().setState((state) => state.increment());
        },
        tooltip: 'Increment',
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() => runApp(RealFlutter()); // Entry point of the application

// Application Flow:
// 1. The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` widget.
// 2. `RealFlutter` uses `Injector` to provide the `CounterState` to the widget tree.
// 3. `CounterPage` is the main screen, displaying the current counter value.
// 4. `StateBuilder` listens to changes in `CounterState` and rebuilds the UI when the state changes.
// 5. The floating action button increments the counter by calling `setState` on the `CounterState`.
// 6. The UI updates to reflect the new counter value whenever the button is pressed.
