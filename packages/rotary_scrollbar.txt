# Setup and Usage
=====================

To use the `rotary_scrollbar` package in your Flutter application, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Pubspec File

Add the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  rotary_scrollbar: ^1.0.0
```
### Step 2: Import the Package

Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:rotary_scrollbar/rotary_scrollbar.dart';
```
### Step 3: Create a Rotary Scrollbar

Create a `RotaryScrollbar` widget and pass in the required properties:
```dart
RotaryScrollbar(
  child: ListView(
    children: [
      // Your content here
    ],
  ),
  scrollbarColor: Colors.blue,
  scrollbarSize: 10,
  scrollThumbColor: Colors.white,
  scrollTrackColor: Colors.grey,
)
```
### Platform-Specific Details

* Android: The `rotary_scrollbar` package uses the Android `ScrollView` widget under the hood. To customize the scrollbar color, you can use the `android:scrollbarThumbVertical` and `android:scrollbarTrackVertical` attributes in your app's theme.
* iOS: The `rotary_scrollbar` package uses the iOS `UIScrollView` widget under the hood. To customize the scrollbar color, you can use the `UIScrollViewIndicatorStyle` enum in your app's theme.

### Required Configurations and Optimizations

* To ensure smooth scrolling, make sure to wrap your content in a `ListView` or `GridView` widget.
* To customize the scrollbar appearance, use the `scrollbarColor`, `scrollbarSize`, `scrollThumbColor`, and `scrollTrackColor` properties.

// The app starts by running the main function, which creates a new instance of the MyApp widget.
// The MyApp widget is a stateless widget that returns a MaterialApp widget with a title and a theme.
// The home property of the MaterialApp widget is set to an instance of the MyHomePage widget.
// The MyHomePage widget is a stateful widget that returns a Scaffold widget with an AppBar and a body.
// The body of the Scaffold widget is set to an instance of the RotaryScrollbar widget.
// The RotaryScrollbar widget takes a child property, which is set to an instance of the ListView widget.
// The ListView widget contains a list of Container widgets with different colors.
// The RotaryScrollbar widget also takes several properties to customize its appearance, such as scrollbarColor, scrollbarSize, scrollThumbColor, and scrollTrackColor.
