# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the HSV Color Pickers Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `hsv_color_pickers` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  hsv_color_pickers: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to set the platform version to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the HSV color picker in your app.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:hsv_color_pickers/hsv_color_pickers.dart';
```

2. Create a stateful widget to manage the color selection:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  Color selectedColor = Colors.red; // Default color

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('HSV Color Picker')),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Display the selected color
          Container(
            height: 100,
            color: selectedColor,
            child: Center(child: Text('Selected Color', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white))),
          ),
          // HSV Color Picker
          HSVColorPicker(
            onChanged: (color) {
              setState(() {
                selectedColor = color.toColor(); // Update the selected color
              });
            },
            color: HSVColor.fromColor(selectedColor), // Initial color
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Run your application to see the color picker in action!

# Complete Example of Using the HSV Color Pickers Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:hsv_color_pickers/hsv_color_pickers.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'HSV Color Picker Example',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  Color selectedColor = Colors.red; // Default color

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('HSV Color Picker')),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Display the selected color
          Container(
            height: 100,
            color: selectedColor,
            child: Center(child: Text('Selected Color', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white))),
          ),
          // HSV Color Picker
          HSVColorPicker(
            onChanged: (color) {
              setState(() {
                selectedColor = color.toColor(); // Update the selected color
              });
            },
            color: HSVColor.fromColor(selectedColor), // Initial color
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets MyApp as the home widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme, setting RealFlutter as the home screen.
// 3. RealFlutter is a stateful widget that maintains the selected color state.
// 4. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Column containing:
//    - A Container that displays the currently selected color.
//    - An HSVColorPicker that allows users to select a color.
// 5. When the user selects a color, the onChanged callback updates the selectedColor state, causing the UI to refresh and display the new color.
```
