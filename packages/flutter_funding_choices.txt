            TextButton(

              onPressed: () {
                Navigator.of(context).pop();
              },
            ),
          ],
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme, and sets FundingChoicesScreen as the home.
// 3. FundingChoicesScreen maintains the state of the selected funding option.
// 4. When the user taps the "Choose Funding Option" button, a dialog is displayed with funding choices.
// 5. The user can select a funding option, which updates the state and displays the selected option on the screen.
// 6. If the user cancels, the dialog closes without making a selection.
