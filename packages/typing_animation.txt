# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the `typing_animation` Package

## Installation
To get started with the `typing_animation` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  typing_animation: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your app requires any specific capabilities. However, the `typing_animation` package does not require any special permissions.

## Basic Usage
To use the `typing_animation` package, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:typing_animation/typing_animation.dart';
```

You can then use the `TypingAnimation` widget in your widget tree. Here’s a simple example:

```dart
TypingAnimation(
  text: 'Hello, Flutter!',
  speed: 100, // Speed in milliseconds
  textStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.black),
)
```

This will create a typing animation that displays "Hello, Flutter!" at a speed of 100 milliseconds per character.

Now that you have a basic understanding of how to set up and use the `typing_animation` package, let’s look at a complete example in the next section.

# Complete Example of Using the `typing_animation` Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:typing_animation/typing_animation.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Typing Animation Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Typing Animation Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Using the TypingAnimation widget to display text
              TypingAnimation(
                text: 'Welcome to the Typing Animation Demo!',
                speed: 100, // Speed of typing effect
                textStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.blue),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between texts
              TypingAnimation(
                text: 'Let\'s make your app more interactive!',
                speed: 150, // Different speed for the second text
                textStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, color: Colors.green),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Typing Animation Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Column widget.
// 5. Inside the Column, two TypingAnimation widgets are used to display text with typing effects.
// 6. The first TypingAnimation displays a welcome message with a speed of 100 milliseconds per character.
// 7. The second TypingAnimation displays a follow-up message with a slightly slower speed of 150 milliseconds.
// 8. The application provides a simple yet effective demonstration of the typing animation feature.
