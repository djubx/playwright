// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and the `RealFlutter` widget is displayed.
// 2. The `TypingAnimation` widget is created and initialized with the text, speed, and delay.
// 3. The `TypingAnimation` widget starts typing out the text.
// 4. The user can adjust the typing speed and delay by modifying the `speed` and `delay` properties.
// 5. The user can pause and resume the typing animation using the `pause` and `resume` methods.

// In summary, the code creates a typing animation using the `TypingAnimation` widget and displays it in the `RealFlutter` widget. The user can adjust the typing speed and delay, and pause and resume the animation.
