# Overview of the "cmd" Flutter Package

The "cmd" package for Flutter is a powerful tool designed to facilitate command-line interface (CLI) interactions within Flutter applications. It allows developers to execute shell commands, manage processes, and handle input/output streams seamlessly. This package is particularly useful for applications that require backend processing, automation tasks, or integration with system-level commands.

## When to Use "cmd"

- **Automation Tools**: If you're building an application that automates tasks, such as file management or system monitoring, the "cmd" package can help you execute shell commands directly from your Flutter app.
- **Development Tools**: For developers creating tools that require command execution, such as build scripts or deployment tools, this package provides a straightforward way to run commands.
- **Integration with Other Systems**: If your app needs to interact with other software or services via command-line tools, "cmd" can bridge that gap.

## Key Features

- **Execute Shell Commands**: Run any shell command and retrieve the output.
- **Process Management**: Start and manage processes, including handling standard input and output.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS, making it versatile for mobile applications.
- **Error Handling**: Provides mechanisms to handle errors and exceptions that may arise during command execution.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the "cmd" Package

## Installation

To use the "cmd" package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  cmd: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your app has the necessary permissions to execute shell commands. You may need to add the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you typically do not need to add special permissions for executing shell commands, but ensure that your app complies with App Store guidelines regarding background processes.

## Basic Usage

Hereâ€™s how to use the "cmd" package in your Flutter application:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:cmd/cmd.dart';
```

2. Create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class and execute a command:

```dart
void executeCommand() async {
  // Create a command instance
  final command = Command('ls', ['-l']); // Example command for listing files

  // Execute the command
  final result = await command.run();

  // Print the output
  print(result.stdout);
}
```

This example demonstrates how to execute a simple command and print its output. You can replace `'ls'` and `['-l']` with any command and its arguments as needed.

# Complete Example of Using the "cmd" Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cmd/cmd.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Cmd Package Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Cmd Package Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: executeCommand,
            child: Text('Run Command'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to execute a shell command
  void executeCommand() async {
    // Create a command instance for listing files
    final command = Command('ls', ['-l']); // Change 'ls' to 'dir' for Windows

    try {
      // Run the command and wait for the result
      final result = await command.run();

      // Check if the command was successful
      if (result.exitCode == 0) {
        // Print the standard output
        print('Command Output: ${result.stdout}');
      } else {
        // Print the error output if the command failed
        print('Error: ${result.stderr}');
      }
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any exceptions that occur during command execution
      print('Exception: $e');
    }
  }
}
```

```
// Explanation of the application flow:

// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a simple UI containing an AppBar and a button.
// 3. When the button is pressed, the executeCommand function is called.
// 4. Inside executeCommand, a Command instance is created to run the 'ls -l' command (or 'dir' for Windows).
// 5. The command is executed asynchronously, and the result is awaited.
// 6. If the command executes successfully (exit code 0), the output is printed to the console.
// 7. If the command fails, the error output is printed.
// 8. Any exceptions during command execution are caught and printed as well.
