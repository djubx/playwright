// The app starts by creating a new Cmd instance and registering two commands: hello and greet.
// The hello command simply prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
// The greet command takes an argument and prints a personalized greeting message.
// The app then runs the hello command and the greet command with an argument.
// Finally, the app creates a new Flutter app with a simple Material Design layout.

// The app flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app.
// 2. The app creates a new Cmd instance and registers the hello and greet commands.
// 3. The app runs the hello command, which prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
// 4. The app runs the greet command with an argument, which prints a personalized greeting message.
// 5. The app creates a new Flutter app with a simple Material Design layout.
// 6. The user interacts with the app.
