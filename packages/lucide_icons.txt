# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Lucide Icons in Flutter

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the Lucide Icons package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  lucide_icons: ^0.1.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the icons, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:lucide_icons/lucide_icons.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using Icons in Your Widgets

You can now use the icons in your Flutter widgets. Hereâ€™s an example of how to use an icon in a `Container`:

```dart
Container(
  child: Icon(
    LucideIcons.home, // Use the icon you want
    size: 40.0, // Set the size of the icon
    color: Colors.blue, // Set the color of the icon
  ),
);
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 5: Optimizations

To optimize the performance of your app, consider using the `const` keyword when creating icons that do not change:

```dart
const Icon(
  LucideIcons.settings,
  size: 30.0,
  color: Colors.green,
);
```

This will help Flutter to reuse the widget instead of creating a new instance every time.

With these steps, you are now ready to use the Lucide Icons package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Using Lucide Icons in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:lucide_icons/lucide_icons.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Lucide Icons Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Lucide Icons Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying a home icon
              Icon(
                LucideIcons.home,
                size: 50.0,
                color: Colors.blue,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              // Displaying a settings icon
              Icon(
                LucideIcons.settings,
                size: 50.0,
                color: Colors.green,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              // Displaying a user icon
              Icon(
                LucideIcons.user,
                size: 50.0,
                color: Colors.red,
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application, which calls runApp().
// 2. The RealFlutter class extends StatelessWidget and builds the main UI.
// 3. A MaterialApp widget is created with a title and a home property.
// 4. The home property is a Scaffold widget that provides the basic structure of the app.
// 5. An AppBar is added with the title 'Lucide Icons Demo'.
// 6. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 7. A Column widget is used to arrange the icons vertically.
// 8. Three Icon widgets are displayed: home, settings, and user, each with different colors and sizes.
// 9. SizedBox widgets are used to add space between the icons for better visual separation.
