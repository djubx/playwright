# Overview of the `statistics` Flutter Package

The `statistics` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to perform statistical operations and analyses within Flutter applications. This package is particularly useful for developers who need to incorporate statistical computations into their apps, such as data analysis, scientific research, or educational tools.

## When to Use the `statistics` Package

- **Data Analysis**: When your application requires processing and analyzing datasets to extract meaningful insights.
- **Educational Apps**: For apps that teach statistics or require statistical computations as part of the learning process.
- **Scientific Research**: When building apps that need to perform complex statistical operations as part of research or data collection.

## Key Features

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculate mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation.
- **Probability Distributions**: Work with various probability distributions like normal, binomial, and Poisson.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Perform t-tests, chi-square tests, and more.
- **Data Visualization**: Although primarily focused on calculations, it can be integrated with visualization libraries to display results.

The `statistics` package is a versatile addition to any Flutter developer's toolkit, providing robust statistical capabilities directly within the app environment.

# Setting Up the `statistics` Package in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up and using the `statistics` package in a Flutter application. We will cover platform-specific configurations for both Android and iOS.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

First, add the `statistics` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  statistics: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configurations

### Android

No specific configurations are required for Android. Ensure your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, ensure your deployment target is set to at least iOS 10.0. Open `ios/Podfile` and update the platform:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

Run `pod install` in the `ios` directory to apply changes.

## Step 3: Importing and Using the Package

Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:statistics/statistics.dart';
```

You can now use the `RealFlutter` class to perform statistical operations. For example, calculating the mean of a dataset:

```dart
var data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
var mean = RealFlutter.mean(data);
print('Mean: $mean');
```

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());

    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Statistics Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: StatisticsHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class StatisticsHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _StatisticsHomePageState createState() => _StatisticsHomePageState();
}

class _StatisticsHomePageState extends State<StatisticsHomePage> {
  final List<double> _data = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0];
  double _mean = 0.0;
  double _median = 0.0;
  double _variance = 0.0;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _calculateStatistics();
  }

  void _calculateStatistics() {
    // Calculate mean using RealFlutter class
    _mean = RealFlutter.mean(_data);
    // Calculate median using RealFlutter class
    _median = RealFlutter.median(_data);
    // Calculate variance using RealFlutter class
    _variance = RealFlutter.variance(_data);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Statistics Demo'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Data: $_data'),
            SizedBox(height: 10),
            Text('Mean: $_mean'),
            Text('Median: $_median'),
            Text('Variance: $_variance'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application starts by running the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// The home screen is set to StatisticsHomePage, a stateful widget.
// In the _StatisticsHomePageState, we define a list of data points and variables to hold statistical results.
// The initState method is overridden to perform initial calculations when the widget is first created.
// The _calculateStatistics method uses the RealFlutter class to compute mean, median, and variance of the data.
// The build method constructs the UI, displaying the data and calculated statistics in a column layout.
