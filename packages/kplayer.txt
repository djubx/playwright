# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using kplayer

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the kplayer package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding kplayer to Your Project

To get started, add the kplayer package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  kplayer: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/kplayer).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your microphone for audio playback.</string>
   <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your photo library for media selection.</string>
   ```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple media player using the kplayer package.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

   ```dart
   import 'package:kplayer/kplayer.dart';
   ```

2. Initialize the player and set up the UI:

   ```dart
   class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
     @override
     _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
   }

   class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
     late KPlayer _player;

     @override
     void initState() {
       super.initState();
       _player = KPlayer();
     }

     @override
     void dispose() {
       _player.dispose();
       super.dispose();
     }

     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return Scaffold(
         appBar: AppBar(title: Text('KPlayer Example')),
         body: Center(
           child: Column(
             mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
             children: [
               ElevatedButton(
                 onPressed: () {
                   _player.play('https://www.example.com/audio.mp3');
                 },
                 child: Text('Play Audio'),
               ),
               ElevatedButton(
                 onPressed: () {
                   _player.pause();
                 },
                 child: Text('Pause Audio'),
               ),
               ElevatedButton(
                 onPressed: () {
                   _player.stop();
                 },
                 child: Text('Stop Audio'),
               ),
             ],
           ),
         ),
       );
     }
   }
   ```

This code sets up a basic audio player with play, pause, and stop functionalities.

# Complete Example of kplayer in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:kplayer/kplayer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late KPlayer _player; // Declare the KPlayer instance

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _player = KPlayer(); // Initialize the KPlayer
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _player.dispose(); // Dispose of the player when not needed
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('KPlayer Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Play audio from a URL
                _player.play('https://www.example.com/audio.mp3');
              },
              child: Text('Play Audio'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Pause the audio playback
                _player.pause();
              },
              child: Text('Pause Audio'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Stop the audio playback
                _player.stop();
              },
              child: Text('Stop Audio'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which initializes the KPlayer instance.
// 3. The UI consists of three buttons: Play, Pause, and Stop.
// 4. When the Play button is pressed, the audio from the specified URL starts playing.
// 5. The Pause button pauses the audio playback, and the Stop button stops it completely.
// 6. The KPlayer instance is disposed of when the widget is removed from the widget tree to free up resources.
```
