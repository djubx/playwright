Here's a detailed technical blog on the "rulers" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Rulers Flutter Package

The **Rulers** Flutter package is a versatile tool designed to help developers create and manage ruler-like UI components in their Flutter applications. This package is particularly useful for applications that require precise measurements, such as design tools, games, or educational apps that involve geometry.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the Rulers package in scenarios such as:
- **Design Applications**: Where users need to measure distances or dimensions on the screen.
- **Games**: For creating interactive elements that require precise positioning.
- **Educational Tools**: To teach concepts related to measurement and geometry.

## Features

- **Customizable Ruler**: You can easily customize the appearance of the ruler, including colors, tick marks, and labels.
- **Horizontal and Vertical Orientation**: Supports both horizontal and vertical rulers, allowing for flexible UI designs.
- **Touch Interaction**: Users can interact with the ruler, making it suitable for applications that require user input.
- **Dynamic Scaling**: The ruler can dynamically scale based on the screen size or user preferences.

With these features, the Rulers package provides a robust solution for any Flutter developer looking to incorporate measurement tools into their applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Rulers Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the Rulers package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  rulers: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Rulers Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a ruler in your app.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:rulers/rulers.dart';
```

2. Create a simple Flutter app that uses the Rulers package:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Ruler Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: RealFlutterRuler(), // Using the RealFlutter class
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, `RealFlutterRuler` is a placeholder for the actual ruler widget you will create using the Rulers package.

# Complete Example of Using the Rulers Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:rulers/rulers.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Ruler Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Ruler Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: RealFlutterRuler(), // Main ruler widget
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// RealFlutterRuler is a custom widget that utilizes the Rulers package
class RealFlutterRuler extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Ruler(
      orientation: RulerOrientation.horizontal, // Set ruler orientation
      rulerColor: Colors.blue, // Customize ruler color
      tickMarkColor: Colors.black, // Customize tick mark color
      labelColor: Colors.red, // Customize label color
      onRulerChanged: (value) {
        // Callback when the ruler value changes
        print('Ruler value: $value');
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. The Center widget contains the RealFlutterRuler widget, which is where the ruler is displayed.
// 4. The RealFlutterRuler widget uses the Ruler class from the Rulers package to create a horizontal ruler.
// 5. The ruler's appearance is customized with colors for the ruler, tick marks, and labels.
// 6. The onRulerChanged callback is triggered whenever the ruler's value changes, allowing for interaction.
```
