# Setting Up and Using the printer_plus Package

## Installation
To get started with `printer_plus`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  printer_plus: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/printer_plus).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request permission for Bluetooth usage:

```xml
<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires Bluetooth access to print documents.</string>
<key>NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires Bluetooth access to print documents.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `printer_plus` package, you will typically follow these steps:
1. Import the package in your Dart file.
2. Initialize the printer.
3. Create a print job with the desired content.
4. Send the print job to the selected printer.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement printing functionality:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:printer_plus/printer_plus.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Printer Plus Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initialize the printer
              final printer = PrinterPlus();
              // Get the list of available printers
              final printers = await printer.getPrinters();
              // Select the first printer (for demonstration)
              final selectedPrinter = printers.first;

              // Create a print job
              final printJob = PrintJob(
                printer: selectedPrinter,
                content: 'Hello, Printer!',
              );

              // Send the print job
              await printer.print(printJob);
            },
            child: Text('Print'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a simple Flutter application with a button that, when pressed, initializes the printer, retrieves available printers, and sends a print job to the first available printer.

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(

              // Initialize the printer
              final printer = PrinterPlus();
              // Get the list of available printers
              final printers = await printer.getPrinters();
              // Select the first printer (for demonstration)
              final selectedPrinter = printers.first;

              // Create a print job
              final printJob = PrintJob(
                printer: selectedPrinter,
                content: 'Hello, Printer!',
              );

              // Send the print job
              await printer.print(printJob);
            },
            child: Text('Print'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which builds a MaterialApp.
// 2. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. The Center widget contains an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the onPressed callback is triggered.
// 5. The PrinterPlus instance is created to manage printing tasks.
// 6. The app retrieves the list of available printers using getPrinters().
// 7. The first printer from the list is selected for demonstration purposes.
// 8. A PrintJob is created with the selected printer and the content to print.
// 9. Finally, the print job is sent to the printer using the print() method.
