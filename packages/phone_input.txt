# Tutorial: Setting Up the Phone Input Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `phone_input` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `phone_input` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  phone_input: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install Packages

Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to access the internet and read phone state if needed:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE"/>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you plan to access the device's phone state:

```xml
<key>NSContactsUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to contacts for phone number input.</string>
```

## Step 4: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the `phone_input` package:

```dart
import 'package:phone_input/phone_input.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Phone Input Widget

You can now use the `PhoneInput` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
PhoneInput(
  onChanged: (phone) {
    // Handle phone number changes
    print('Phone number: $phone');
  },
  onCountryChanged: (country) {
    // Handle country changes
    print('Selected country: ${country.name}');
  },
)
```

This widget will automatically handle the formatting and validation of the phone number based on the selected country.

# Complete Example of Using Phone Input

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:phone_input/phone_input.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Phone Input Example',
      home: PhoneInputScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PhoneInputScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PhoneInputScreenState createState() => _PhoneInputScreenState();
}

class _PhoneInputScreenState extends State<PhoneInputScreen> {
  String _phoneNumber = ''; // Variable to hold the phone number

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Phone Input Example'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            // Phone input field
            PhoneInput(
              onChanged: (phone) {
                setState(() {
                  _phoneNumber = phone; // Update the phone number state
                });
              },
              onCountryChanged: (country) {
                // Handle country change if needed
                print('Selected country: ${country.name}');
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Display the entered phone number
            Text('Entered Phone Number: $_phoneNumber'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp and its title.
// 3. The PhoneInputScreen is created as the home screen of the app.
// 4. Inside PhoneInputScreen, a StatefulWidget is used to manage the state of the phone number.
// 5. The PhoneInput widget is displayed, which allows users to input their phone number.
// 6. When the phone number changes, the onChanged callback updates the _phoneNumber state.
// 7. The entered phone number is displayed below the input field, updating in real-time as the user types.
```
