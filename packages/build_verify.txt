# Build_Verify Flutter Package

The `build_verify` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to streamline the process of verifying builds in Flutter applications. It provides developers with a straightforward way to ensure that their builds are consistent and meet specified criteria before deployment. This package is particularly useful in CI/CD pipelines, where automated verification of builds is crucial for maintaining code quality and stability.

## When to Use

You should consider using the `build_verify` package in scenarios such as:

- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Automating the verification of builds before they are deployed to production.
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensuring that the builds meet specific quality standards and pass all necessary tests.
- **Version Control**: Keeping track of build versions and ensuring that the correct versions are deployed.

## Features

- **Build Verification**: Automatically verifies builds against predefined criteria.
- **Customizable Checks**: Allows developers to define custom checks based on their project requirements.
- **Integration with CI/CD Tools**: Easily integrates with popular CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and Jenkins.
- **Detailed Reporting**: Provides detailed reports on build verification results, making it easier to identify issues.

By leveraging the `build_verify` package, developers can enhance their build processes, reduce errors, and improve overall application quality.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Build_Verify

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `build_verify` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `build_verify` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  build_verify: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file includes the necessary configurations. You may need to add specific permissions or settings depending on your verification requirements.

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        // Add any required configurations here
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add any necessary permissions or configurations that your app may require for build verification.

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. Below is an example of how to implement build verification in your app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:build_verify/build_verify.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Build Verify Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Build Verify Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Start the build verification process
              final result = await BuildVerify.verify();

              // Check the result of the verification
              if (result.isSuccessful) {
                // Show success message
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Build verification successful!')),
                );
              } else {
                // Show error message
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Build verification failed: ${result.errorMessage}')),
                );
              }
            },
            child: Text('Verify Build'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Build_Verify in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:build_verify/build_verify.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Build Verify Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Build Verify Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Start the build verification process
              final result = await BuildVerify.verify();

              // Check the result of the verification
              if (result.isSuccessful) {
                // Show success message
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Build verification successful!')),
                );
              } else {
                // Show error message
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Build verification failed: ${result.errorMessage}')),
                );
              }
            },
            child: Text('Verify Build'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts by running the main function, which initializes the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the build verification process is initiated by calling BuildVerify.verify().
// 5. The result of the verification is checked. If successful, a success message is displayed using a SnackBar.
// 6. If the verification fails, an error message is displayed with the reason for the failure.
