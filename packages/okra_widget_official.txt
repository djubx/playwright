# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Okra Widget Official Package

## Installation
To get started with the **okra_widget_official** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  okra_widget_official: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/okra_widget_official).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure you have the following configurations:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       compileSdkVersion 31
       ...
   }
   ```

2. Add the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following:
   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. Ensure you have the correct deployment target set in your `ios/Podfile`:
   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

## Using the Package
Once you have installed the package and configured your project, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the Okra widget.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:okra_widget_official/okra_widget_official.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Okra Widget Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: OkraWidget(
            onSuccess: (data) {
              // Handle successful data retrieval
              print('Data: $data');
            },
            onError: (error) {
              // Handle error
              print('Error: $error');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `OkraWidget` is used to initiate the data retrieval process. The `onSuccess` and `onError` callbacks handle the respective outcomes of the operation.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the **okra_widget_official** package into your Flutter application successfully.

# Complete Example of Using the Okra Widget Official Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:okra_widget_official/okra_widget_official.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Okra Widget Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: OkraWidget(
            onSuccess: (data) {
              // This callback is triggered when data is successfully retrieved
              print('Data: $data');
            },
            onError: (error) {
              // This callback is triggered when there is an error in data retrieval
              print('Error: $error');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, the OkraWidget is instantiated.
// 4. The OkraWidget takes two callbacks: onSuccess and onError.
// 5. When the OkraWidget successfully retrieves data, the onSuccess callback is executed, printing the data to the console.
// 6. If there is an error during data retrieval, the onError callback is executed, printing the error message to the console.
