// The app starts by running the `main` function, which creates a `MaterialApp` instance.
// The `MaterialApp` instance has a `title` property set to 'Soft Keyboard Demo'.
// The `home` property is set to an instance of the `RealFlutter` widget.
// The `RealFlutter` widget is a stateful widget that creates a `Scaffold` instance.
// The `Scaffold` instance has an `appBar` property set to an `AppBar` instance with a title.
// The `body` property is set to a `Column` instance that contains a `TextField` and a `SoftKeyboard` instance.
// The `SoftKeyboard` instance has a custom keyboard layout with two rows of keys.
// Each key has a label and an `onPressed` callback that appends the label to the `TextField` instance.
