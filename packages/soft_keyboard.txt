# Overview of the soft_keyboard Flutter Package

The `soft_keyboard` package is a Flutter plugin designed to provide developers with enhanced control over the soft keyboard behavior in their applications. This package is particularly useful when you need to manage keyboard visibility, adjust UI elements based on keyboard state, or customize the keyboard's appearance and behavior.

## When to Use This Package
- **Dynamic UI Adjustments**: When your app's layout needs to adapt based on whether the keyboard is visible or hidden.
- **Custom Keyboard Handling**: If you want to implement specific behaviors when the keyboard appears, such as scrolling to a particular widget.
- **User Experience Enhancements**: To improve user experience by managing keyboard interactions more effectively.

## Key Features
- **Keyboard Visibility Detection**: Easily detect when the keyboard is shown or hidden.
- **Customizable Keyboard Behavior**: Control how your app responds to keyboard events.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

The `soft_keyboard` package is a valuable tool for Flutter developers looking to create responsive and user-friendly applications that require fine-tuned keyboard interactions.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the soft_keyboard Package

## Installation
To get started with the `soft_keyboard` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  soft_keyboard: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/soft_keyboard).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions and configurations. Typically, no additional configurations are required for basic usage.

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to ensure that your app's deployment target is set to at least iOS 9.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
```

## Using the Package
To use the `soft_keyboard` package, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:soft_keyboard/soft_keyboard.dart';
```

You can then utilize the package's features to manage keyboard visibility and respond to keyboard events. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to detect keyboard visibility.

# Complete Example of Using soft_keyboard

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:soft_keyboard/soft_keyboard.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to track keyboard visibility
  bool _isKeyboardVisible = false;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Listen for keyboard visibility changes
    SoftKeyboard.addListener(_keyboardVisibilityListener);
  }

  // Listener to handle keyboard visibility changes
  void _keyboardVisibilityListener(bool isVisible) {
    setState(() {
      _isKeyboardVisible = isVisible; // Update the state based on visibility
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Remove the listener when the widget is disposed
    SoftKeyboard.removeListener(_keyboardVisibilityListener);
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Soft Keyboard Example'),
        ),
        body: Column(
          children: [
            // Display a message based on keyboard visibility
            Padding(
              padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
              child: Text(
                _isKeyboardVisible ? 'Keyboard is visible' : 'Keyboard is hidden',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
              ),
            ),
            // TextField to trigger the keyboard
            TextField(
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                border: OutlineInputBorder(),
                labelText: 'Type something...',
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application that utilizes the soft_keyboard package.
// 1. The app starts by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the _RealFlutterState class, we define a boolean variable _isKeyboardVisible to track the keyboard's visibility.
// 3. We set up a listener in the initState method to listen for keyboard visibility changes.
// 4. The _keyboardVisibilityListener method updates the state whenever the keyboard is shown or hidden.
// 5. In the build method, we create a simple UI with a Text widget that displays the current keyboard state and a TextField to trigger the keyboard.
// 6. Finally, we remove the listener in the dispose method to prevent memory leaks.

// This application effectively demonstrates how to use the soft_keyboard package to manage keyboard visibility in a Flutter app.
