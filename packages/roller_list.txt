# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Roller List

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **roller_list** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  roller_list: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:roller_list/roller_list.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Roller List

You can now use the **roller_list** in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:roller_list/roller_list.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Roller List Example')),
        body: RollerList(
          items: List.generate(20, (index) => 'Item $index'),
          itemBuilder: (context, item, index) {
            return Card(
              child: Padding(
                padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
                child: Text(item, style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24)),
              ),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application that uses the **roller_list** package to display a list of items in a card format. The `itemBuilder` function is used to define how each item should be displayed.

With these steps, you should be able to successfully integrate and use the **roller_list** package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Roller List

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:roller_list/roller_list.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Roller List Example')),
        body: RollerList(
          // Generating a list of 20 items
          items: List.generate(20, (index) => 'Item $index'),
          itemBuilder: (context, item, index) {
            // Building each item as a Card widget
            return Card(
              child: Padding(
                padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
                child: Text(item, style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24)),
              );
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  // Running the RealFlutter application
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the main UI.
// 3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// 4. The AppBar displays the title "Roller List Example".
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains a RollerList widget.
// 6. The RollerList is populated with 20 items generated dynamically.
// 7. Each item is displayed as a Card with padding and a text label.
// 8. The itemBuilder function is responsible for creating the UI for each item.
// 9. Finally, the runApp function launches the application with the RealFlutter widget.
