# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Loading Animations Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the `loading_animations` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  loading_animations: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package
In your Dart file where you want to use the loading animations, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:loading_animations/loading_animations.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Animations
You can now use the loading animations in your widget tree. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a loading animation:

```dart
LoadingAnimationWidget.inkDrop(
  color: Colors.blue,
  size: 50.0,
)
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Optimizations
- **Performance**: Use the animations judiciously to avoid performance issues, especially on lower-end devices.
- **Testing**: Test the animations on both Android and iOS devices to ensure they render correctly and do not hinder the user experience.

With these steps, you should be able to successfully integrate and use the `loading_animations` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using Loading Animations

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:loading_animations/loading_animations.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Loading Animations Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: LoadingScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class LoadingScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _LoadingScreenState createState() => _LoadingScreenState();
}

class _LoadingScreenState extends State<LoadingScreen> {
  bool _isLoading = true; // State variable to track loading status

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Simulate a network request or long-running task
    Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3), () {
      setState(() {
        _isLoading = false; // Update loading status after delay
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Loading Animations'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: _isLoading
            ? LoadingAnimationWidget.inkDrop(
                color: Colors.blue, // Color of the loading animation
                size: 50.0, // Size of the loading animation
              )
            : Text(
                'Data Loaded!', // Message displayed after loading
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home screen is set to LoadingScreen, which manages the loading state.
// 4. In the LoadingScreen's initState, a simulated delay of 3 seconds is created to mimic a network request.
// 5. While loading, the InkDrop loading animation is displayed.
// 6. After the delay, the loading state is updated, and the message "Data Loaded!" is shown instead of the animation.
