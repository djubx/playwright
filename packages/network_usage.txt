# Understanding the `network_usage` Flutter Package

The `network_usage` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to monitor and analyze network usage within their applications. This package provides a straightforward way to track the amount of data sent and received over the network, making it particularly useful for applications that require efficient data management or need to provide users with insights into their data consumption.

## When to Use `network_usage`

- **Data-Intensive Applications**: If your app frequently sends or receives large amounts of data, tracking network usage can help optimize performance and user experience.
- **User Awareness**: Applications that need to inform users about their data consumption, such as social media or streaming apps, can benefit from this package.
- **Debugging Network Issues**: Developers can use this package to diagnose network-related problems by monitoring data flow.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Track network usage in real-time, providing immediate feedback on data consumption.
- **Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Simple API**: Easy-to-use API that integrates well with existing Flutter applications.

# Setting Up and Using the `network_usage` Package

## Installation

To get started with the `network_usage` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  network_usage: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/network_usage).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file. Add the following lines within the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `Info.plist` file to allow network usage tracking:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Using the Package

Once you have installed the package and configured your project, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initialize and use the `network_usage` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:network_usage/network_usage.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  NetworkUsage _networkUsage = NetworkUsage();
  String _dataUsage = "Data usage: ";

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _startMonitoring();
  }

  void _startMonitoring() async {
    await _networkUsage.startMonitoring();
    _networkUsage.onDataUsageChanged.listen((data) {
      setState(() {
        _dataUsage = "Data usage: ${data.toString()}";
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _networkUsage.stopMonitoring();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Network Usage Example")),
      body: Center(child: Text(_dataUsage)),
    );
  }
}
```

This code initializes the `network_usage` package, starts monitoring data usage, and updates the UI with the current data usage.

# Complete Example of Using the `network_usage` Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:network_usage/network_usage.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Create an instance of NetworkUsage to monitor data
  NetworkUsage _networkUsage = NetworkUsage();
  // Variable to hold the data usage information
  String _dataUsage = "Data usage: ";

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Start monitoring network usage when the widget is initialized
    _startMonitoring();
  }

  void _startMonitoring() async {
    // Start the monitoring process
    await _networkUsage.startMonitoring();
    // Listen for changes in data usage
    _networkUsage.onDataUsageChanged.listen((data) {
      // Update the state with the new data usage information
      setState(() {
        _dataUsage = "Data usage: ${data.toString()}";
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Stop monitoring when the widget is disposed
    _networkUsage.stopMonitoring();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Build the UI with a simple text display of data usage
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Network Usage Example")),
      body: Center(child: Text(_dataUsage)),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(home: RealFlutter()));
}
```

// The application starts by creating an instance of `NetworkUsage`.
// In the `initState` method, we call `_startMonitoring` to begin tracking network usage.
// The `_startMonitoring` method starts the monitoring process and listens for data usage changes.
// Whenever there is a change in data usage, the UI is updated with the new value.
// The `dispose` method ensures that monitoring stops when the widget is removed from the widget tree.
// The `build` method constructs the UI, displaying the current data usage in the center of the screen.
// Finally, the `main` function runs the app, setting `RealFlutter` as the home widget.
