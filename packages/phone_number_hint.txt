# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the phone_number_hint Package

## Installation
To use the `phone_number_hint` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  phone_number_hint: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/phone_number_hint).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you plan to access the user's contacts or phone capabilities. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSContactsUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your contacts.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your photo library.</string>
```

# Complete Example of Using phone_number_hint

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:phone_number_hint/phone_number_hint.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Phone Number Hint Example',
      home: PhoneNumberForm(),
    );
  }
}

class PhoneNumberForm extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PhoneNumberFormState createState() => _PhoneNumberFormState();
}

class _PhoneNumberFormState extends State<PhoneNumberForm> {
  // Controller to manage the phone number input
  final TextEditingController _phoneController = TextEditingController();
  String _selectedCountryCode = '+1'; // Default country code

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Phone Number Input'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            // Dropdown for selecting country code
            DropdownButton<String>(
              value: _selectedCountryCode,
              items: <String>['+1', '+44', '+91'].map((String value) {
                return DropdownMenuItem<String>(
                  value: value,
                  child: Text(value),
                );
              }).toList(),
              onChanged: (String? newValue) {
                setState(() {
                  _selectedCountryCode = newValue!;
                });
              },
            ),
            // Phone number input field
            PhoneNumberHint(
              controller: _phoneController,
              countryCode: _selectedCountryCode,
              hintText: 'Enter your phone number',
              onChanged: (value) {
                // Handle changes in the phone number input
                print('Phone number: $value');
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Handle form submission
                print('Submitted Phone Number: ${_phoneController.text}');
              },
              child: Text('Submit'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
// The above code creates a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the phone_number_hint package.
// 
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets the home widget to PhoneNumberForm.
// 2. The PhoneNumberForm widget contains a dropdown for selecting the country code and a PhoneNumberHint input field.
// 3. The user can select a country code from the dropdown, which updates the _selectedCountryCode state variable.
// 4. The PhoneNumberHint widget takes the selected country code and formats the phone number as the user types.
// 5. When the user submits the form, the entered phone number is printed to the console.
// 
// This example showcases how to integrate the phone_number_hint package into a Flutter application, providing a user-friendly way to input phone numbers with real-time formatting and validation.
