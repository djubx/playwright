# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Filling Slider

## Installation
To use the filling_slider package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  filling_slider: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Usage
### Basic Setup
To use the filling_slider in your Flutter application, you need to import the package:

```dart
import 'package:filling_slider/filling_slider.dart';
```

### Platform-Specific Details
- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid compatibility issues.
- **iOS**: No additional configuration is required for iOS, but ensure you are using a compatible version of Xcode.

### Example Implementation
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the filling_slider in your Flutter app:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:filling_slider/filling_slider.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  double _sliderValue = 0.5; // Initial value of the slider

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Filling Slider Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Value: ${(_sliderValue * 100).toStringAsFixed(0)}%'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            FillingSlider(
              value: _sliderValue,
              onChanged: (value) {
                setState(() {
                  _sliderValue = value; // Update the slider value
                });
              },
              min: 0.0,
              max: 1.0,
              fillColor: Colors.blue, // Color of the filled part
              unfilledColor: Colors.grey, // Color of the unfilled part
              thumbColor: Colors.red, // Color of the slider thumb
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple app with a filling slider that allows users to select a value between 0 and 1. The current value is displayed above the slider.

# Complete Example of Filling Slider

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:filling_slider/filling_slider.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  double _sliderValue = 0.5; // Initial value of the slider

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Filling Slider Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the current value of the slider
            Text('Value: ${(_sliderValue * 100).toStringAsFixed(0)}%'),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Add space between text and slider
            FillingSlider(
              value: _sliderValue, // Current value of the slider
              onChanged: (value) {
                setState(() {
                  _sliderValue = value; // Update the slider value on change
                });
              },
              min: 0.0, // Minimum value of the slider
              max: 1.0, // Maximum value of the slider
              fillColor: Colors.blue, // Color of the filled part of the slider
              unfilledColor: Colors.grey, // Color of the unfilled part of the slider
              thumbColor: Colors.red, // Color of the slider thumb
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    home: RealFlutter(), // Run the RealFlutter widget
  ));
}
```

// The application starts with the main function, which runs the MaterialApp.
// The RealFlutter widget is the home of the app, which contains a stateful widget.
// Inside the stateful widget, we define a variable _sliderValue to hold the current value of the slider.
// The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// The Center widget contains a Column that displays the current value of the slider and the FillingSlider itself.
// The FillingSlider is configured with a range from 0.0 to 1.0, and its appearance is customized with colors.
// When the slider is moved, the onChanged callback updates the _sliderValue and triggers a rebuild to reflect the new value.
// This creates an interactive experience where users can see the value change in real-time as they adjust the slider.
