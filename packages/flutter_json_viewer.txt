```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_json_viewer/flutter_json_viewer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'JSON Viewer Demo',
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  String _jsonData = '{"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('JSON Viewer Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: JsonViewer(
          jsonData: _jsonData,
          // Customize the appearance of the JSON viewer
          theme: JsonViewerTheme(
            backgroundColor: Colors.white,
            textColor: Colors.black,
            iconColor: Colors.blue,
          ),
          // Optimize the performance of the JSON viewer
          options: JsonViewerOptions(
            maxDepth: 5,
            showCopyButton: true,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a JSON viewer widget.
// 2. The JSON viewer widget displays the JSON data in a tree-like structure.
// 3. The user can expand and collapse nodes to view more or less data.
// 4. The user can search for specific data using the search function.
// 5. The user can copy the JSON data to the clipboard using the copy button.
// 6. The app customizes the appearance of the JSON viewer using a theme object.
// 7. The app optimizes the performance of the JSON viewer using an options object.

// Final summary: The code flows by first creating a JSON viewer widget and passing in the JSON data.
// The app then customizes the appearance and optimizes the performance of the JSON viewer.
// The user can interact with the JSON viewer by expanding and collapsing nodes, searching for data, and copying the data to the clipboard.
