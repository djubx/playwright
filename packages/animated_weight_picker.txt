# Complete Example of Animated Weight Picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_weight_picker/animated_weight_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animated Weight Picker Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: WeightPickerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class WeightPickerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _WeightPickerScreenState createState() => _WeightPickerScreenState();
}

class _WeightPickerScreenState extends State<WeightPickerScreen> {
  // Variable to hold the selected weight
  double _selectedWeight = 70.0; // Default weight

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Select Your Weight'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the selected weight
            Text(
              'Selected Weight: ${_selectedWeight.toStringAsFixed(1)} kg',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Animated Weight Picker
            AnimatedWeightPicker(
              initialWeight: _selectedWeight,
              onWeightChanged: (newWeight) {
                // Update the selected weight when the user picks a new weight
                setState(() {
                  _selectedWeight = newWeight;
                });
              },
              minWeight: 30.0, // Minimum weight limit
              maxWeight: 200.0, // Maximum weight limit
              step: 0.5, // Step size for weight selection
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home screen is set to WeightPickerScreen, which is a stateful widget.
// 4. Inside WeightPickerScreen, we define a variable _selectedWeight to hold the current weight.
// 5. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 6. The Center widget contains a Column that displays the selected weight and the AnimatedWeightPicker.
// 7. The AnimatedWeightPicker is configured with initial weight, min/max limits, and a step size.
// 8. When the user selects a new weight, the onWeightChanged callback updates the _selectedWeight variable, triggering a rebuild to display the new weight.
