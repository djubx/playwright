// This code creates a simple Flutter app with a text that contains a URL, email address, and phone number.
// The LinkifyText widget is used to detect and handle these patterns in the text.
// When a pattern is tapped, the onTap callback is called with the link object.
// The link object contains the type and value of the link, which can be used to handle the tap event accordingly.
// In this example, a switch statement is used to handle different types of links and print a message to the console.
