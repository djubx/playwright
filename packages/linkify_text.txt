# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `linkify_text`

## Installation
To use the `linkify_text` package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  linkify_text: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if you plan to open links in a browser. You may need to add:

```xml
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
    <string>http</string>
    <string>https</string>
</array>
```

## Using the Package
To use the `linkify_text` package, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:linkify_text/linkify_text.dart';
```

You can then use the `LinkifyText` widget to display text with links. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
LinkifyText(
  text: 'Check out https://flutter.dev and email us at info@flutter.dev!',
  linkStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.blue, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
  onTap: (link) {
    // Handle link tap
    print('Tapped on: ${link.url}');
  },
);
```

This widget will automatically detect the URL and email address in the text and make them clickable.

# Complete Example of `linkify_text`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:linkify_text/linkify_text.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Linkify Text Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Linkify Text Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: LinkifyText(
            text: 'Visit us at https://flutter.dev or email us at info@flutter.dev!',
            linkStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.blue, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
            onTap: (link) {
              // Handle link tap
              print('Tapped on: ${link.url}');
              // Here you can add logic to open the link in a browser
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Linkify Text Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers a LinkifyText widget.
// 5. The LinkifyText widget takes a string containing a URL and an email address.
// 6. The linkStyle property customizes the appearance of the links.
// 7. The onTap callback is triggered when a link is tapped, printing the link URL to the console.
// 8. You can extend the onTap functionality to open the link in a web browser or perform other actions.
