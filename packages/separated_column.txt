<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Separated Column Flutter Package

The **separated_column** Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to help developers create flexible and responsive layouts in their Flutter applications. This package allows you to easily create a column layout with customizable spacing between its children, making it ideal for scenarios where you need to maintain consistent spacing without manually adjusting each widget's padding or margin.

## When to Use

You might consider using the **separated_column** package in the following scenarios:

- **Dynamic Content**: When you have a list of widgets that may change in number or size, and you want to maintain consistent spacing.
- **Responsive Design**: When building applications that need to adapt to different screen sizes and orientations, ensuring that the layout remains visually appealing.
- **Simplified Code**: When you want to reduce boilerplate code related to spacing and alignment in your Flutter layouts.

## Features

- **Customizable Spacing**: Easily set the spacing between children with a single parameter.
- **Flexible Layout**: Supports various child widgets, allowing for a diverse range of UI designs.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Built with performance in mind, ensuring smooth rendering even with complex layouts.

By leveraging the **separated_column** package, developers can create clean, maintainable, and visually appealing layouts with minimal effort.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Separated Column

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **separated_column** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  separated_column: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the **separated_column**, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:separated_column/separated_column.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using SeparatedColumn

You can now use the `SeparatedColumn` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
SeparatedColumn(
  separator: SizedBox(height: 20), // Set the height of the separator
  children: [
    Text('Item 1'),
    Text('Item 2'),
    Text('Item 3'),
  ],
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

#### iOS

For iOS, make sure your deployment target in `ios/Podfile` is set to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Optimizations

To optimize performance, consider using the `const` constructor for static children in the `SeparatedColumn`:

```dart
SeparatedColumn(
  separator: const SizedBox(height: 20),
  children: const [
    Text('Item 1'),
    Text('Item 2'),
    Text('Item 3'),
  ],
)
```

This will help Flutter to rebuild only the necessary parts of the widget tree, improving performance.

# Complete Example of Separated Column

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:separated_column/separated_column.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Separated Column Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Separated Column Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: SeparatedColumn(
            separator: const SizedBox(height: 20), // Define the space between items
            children: const [
              Text('Item 1'), // First item
              Text('Item 2'), // Second item
              Text('Item 3'), // Third item
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, we use SeparatedColumn to arrange three Text widgets.
// 5. The separator is a SizedBox that provides a height of 20 pixels between each item.
// 6. The app displays a simple layout with three items spaced evenly, demonstrating the use of the separated_column package.
```

## Summary

In this blog, we explored the **separated_column** Flutter package, detailing its features, setup process, and providing a complete example. The application flow is straightforward: it initializes a Flutter app, sets up a basic UI with an AppBar, and uses the `SeparatedColumn` widget to display items with consistent spacing. This package simplifies layout management in Flutter, making it an excellent choice for developers looking to enhance their UI design with minimal effort.
