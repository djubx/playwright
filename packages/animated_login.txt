# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Animated Login Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **animated_login** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **animated_login** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  animated_login: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` file to allow for certain permissions, depending on your app's requirements. For example, if you are using any network features, ensure you have the appropriate permissions set.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that the package is set up, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the animated login screen.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_login/animated_login.dart'; // Import the animated_login package

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp()); // Run the main application
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animated Login Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: LoginScreen(), // Set the home screen to LoginScreen
    );
  }
}

class LoginScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: Center(
        child: AnimatedLogin(
          // AnimatedLogin widget to create the login screen
          onLogin: (username, password) {
            // Callback function when login is successful
            print('Username: $username, Password: $password');
          },
          onForgotPassword: () {
            // Callback function for forgot password action
            print('Forgot Password clicked');
          },
          onRegister: () {
            // Callback function for register action
            print('Register clicked');
          },
          // Customize the appearance of the login screen
          title: 'Welcome Back',
          subtitle: 'Please login to continue',
          usernameHint: 'Username',
          passwordHint: 'Password',
          loginButtonText: 'Login',
          forgotPasswordText: 'Forgot Password?',
          registerText: 'Don\'t have an account? Register',
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home screen is set to LoginScreen, which contains the AnimatedLogin widget.
// 4. The AnimatedLogin widget displays a login form with customizable fields and buttons.
// 5. When the user clicks the login button, the onLogin callback is triggered, printing the username and password.
// 6. The onForgotPassword and onRegister callbacks are also defined to handle those actions.
```
