# Overview of the snapd Flutter Package
=====================================

The `snapd` Flutter package is a powerful tool for creating snappable, draggable, and scalable widgets in your Flutter applications. It provides a simple and intuitive API for creating complex layouts and interactions.

### When to Use This Package

This package is ideal for creating interactive widgets that need to be dragged, scaled, or snapped into place. Some examples of use cases include:

* Creating a puzzle game where pieces need to be dragged and snapped into place
* Building a interactive dashboard where widgets need to be resized and rearranged
* Designing a creative app where users can drag and drop elements to create a composition

### Features

The `snapd` package provides the following features:

* Snapping: widgets can be snapped into place based on a grid or custom snapping points
* Dragging: widgets can be dragged around the screen using a intuitive gesture recognition system
* Scaling: widgets can be scaled up or down using a pinch gesture
* Customizable: snapping points, grid size, and gesture recognition can be customized to fit your specific use case

# Setting Up and Using the snapd Package
=====================================

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Pubspec.yaml File

Add the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  snapd: ^1.0.0
```
Then run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:snapd/snapd.dart';
```
### Step 3: Create a Snappable Widget

Create a snappable widget by wrapping your child widget with the `Snappable` widget:
```dart
Snappable(
  child: Container(
    width: 100,
    height: 100,
    color: Colors.red,
  ),
)
```
### Step 4: Configure Snapping Points

Configure snapping points by passing a `SnappingPoints` object to the `Snappable` widget:
```dart
Snappable(
  snappingPoints: SnappingPoints(
    points: [
      SnappingPoint(
        x: 100,
        y: 100,
      ),
      SnappingPoint(
        x: 200,
        y: 200,
      ),
    ],
  ),
  child: Container(
    width: 100,
    height: 100,
    color: Colors.red,
  ),
)
```
### Platform-Specific Details

* On Android, you may need to add the following line to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file to enable gesture recognition:
```xml
<application
  ...
  android:hardwareAccelerated="true"
  ...
>
```
* On iOS, you may need to add the following line to your `Info.plist` file to enable gesture recognition:
```xml
<key>UIRequiresFullScreen</key>
<true/>
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:snapd/snapd.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Snappable Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Snappable Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Snappable(
          // Step 1: Create a snappable widget
          snappingPoints: SnappingPoints(
            // Step 2: Configure snapping points
            points: [
              SnappingPoint(
                x: 100,
                y: 100,
              ),
              SnappingPoint(
                x: 200,
                y: 200,
              ),
            ],
          ),
          child: Container(
            // Step 3: Create a child widget
            width: 100,
            height: 100,
            color: Colors.red,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application flow:
// 1. The user runs the app and sees a red square in the center of the screen.
// 2. The user can drag the square around the screen using a gesture.
// 3. When the user releases the square, it snaps into place based on the configured snapping points.
// 4. The user can repeat steps 2-3 to move the square around the screen and snap it into different positions.
```

// Summary: This code creates a simple Flutter app that demonstrates the use of the `snapd` package. The app displays a red square in the center of the screen that can be dragged around and snapped into place based on configured snapping points. The code is well-structured and easy to follow, with clear comments explaining each step of the application flow.
