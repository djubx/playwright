# Snapd Flutter Package: A Comprehensive Overview

The **snapd** Flutter package is designed to provide developers with a simple and efficient way to implement snap-to-grid functionality in their applications. This package is particularly useful for applications that require a grid-like layout, such as photo galleries, dashboards, or any interface where items need to be aligned neatly.

## When to Use Snapd
- **Grid Layouts**: When you need to create a grid layout where items snap into place.
- **Interactive Interfaces**: For applications that require drag-and-drop functionality with snapping behavior.
- **Game Development**: Useful in games where objects need to align to a grid.

## Key Features
- **Snap-to-Grid**: Automatically aligns items to a specified grid size.
- **Customizable Grid Size**: Allows developers to define the size of the grid cells.
- **Smooth Animations**: Provides smooth transitions when items snap into place.
- **Gesture Support**: Supports touch gestures for dragging and dropping items.

Overall, the snapd package enhances the user experience by providing a visually appealing and organized layout for various applications.

# Snapd Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the snapd package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  snapd: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/snapd).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file if your application requires specific functionalities. However, for basic usage of snapd, no additional configurations are necessary.

## Basic Usage
To use the snapd package, you will typically create a widget that utilizes the snapping functionality. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:snapd/snapd.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Snapd Example')),
        body: SnapGrid(
          gridSize: 100, // Define the size of the grid cells
          children: List.generate(10, (index) {
            return Draggable(
              child: Container(
                width: 80,
                height: 80,
                color: Colors.blue,
                child: Center(child: Text('Item $index')),
              ),
              feedback: Material(
                child: Container(
                  width: 80,
                  height: 80,
                  color: Colors.blue.withOpacity(0.5),
                  child: Center(child: Text('Item $index')),
                ),
              ),
              childWhenDragging: Container(),
            );
          }),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application that uses the snapd package to create a draggable grid of items.

# Complete Example of Snapd in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:snapd/snapd.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Snapd Example')),
        body: SnapGrid(
          gridSize: 100, // Define the size of the grid cells
          children: List.generate(10, (index) {
            return Draggable(
              child: Container(
                width: 80,
                height: 80,
                color: Colors.blue,
                child: Center(child: Text('Item $index')),
              ),
              feedback: Material(
                child: Container(
                  width: 80,
                  height: 80,
                  color: Colors.blue.withOpacity(0.5),
                  child: Center(child: Text('Item $index')),
                ),
              ),
              childWhenDragging: Container(),
            );
          }),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the `RealFlutter` widget, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. Inside the `build` method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// 3. The AppBar displays the title 'Snapd Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a SnapGrid widget, which is responsible for the snapping functionality.
// 5. The SnapGrid is configured with a grid size of 100 pixels.
// 6. A list of 10 draggable items is generated using List.generate.
// 7. Each item is a Draggable widget that displays a blue container with text.
// 8. When an item is dragged, a feedback widget is shown, which is a semi-transparent version of the item.
// 9. The `childWhenDragging` property is set to an empty container, which means the original item will disappear while dragging.
// 10. The SnapGrid will automatically align the items to the defined grid size when they are dropped.
