// The app starts by running the `MyApp` widget, which is a stateless widget that wraps the `MaterialApp` widget.
// The `MaterialApp` widget is the root widget of the app, and it provides a basic material design visual layout structure.
// The `MyHomePage` widget is a stateful widget that represents the home page of the app.
// The `MyHomePage` widget uses the `Scaffold` widget to provide a basic material design visual layout structure.
// The `ScaleTap` widget is used to wrap the `Container` widget, which is the widget that we want to detect tap gestures on.
// The `ScaleTap` widget provides a customizable tap gesture animation, and it handles tap and long press gestures.
// When a tap gesture is detected, the `onPressed` callback is called, and when a long press gesture is detected, the `onLongPress` callback is called.
