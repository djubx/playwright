```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/tdesign_flutter).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the platform version in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Importing the Package

Once you have added the dependency, you can import the package into your Dart files:

```dart
import 'package:tdesign_flutter/tdesign_flutter.dart';
```

## Basic Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use a button from the `tdesign_flutter` package:

```dart
TButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // Handle button press
  },
  child: Text('Click Me'),
);
```

This button can be customized with various properties such as color, size, and shape to fit your design needs.

# Complete Example of tdesign_flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tdesign_flutter/tdesign_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'TDesign Flutter Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('TDesign Flutter Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: TButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Action to perform on button press
            showDialog(
              context: context,
              builder: (context) {
                return AlertDialog(
                  title: Text('Hello!'),
                  content: Text('You clicked the button!'),
                  actions: [
                    TextButton(
                      onPressed: () {
                        Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                      },
                      child: Text('Close'),
                    ),
                  ],
                );
              },
            );
          },
          child: Text('Click Me'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to HomePage, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 4. HomePage builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a TButton is created.
// 6. When the button is pressed, an AlertDialog is shown with a message.
// 7. The dialog has a close button that dismisses the dialog when pressed.
```

## Summary of Application Flow

The application starts with the `main` function, which initializes the Flutter app. The `MyApp` class sets up the main structure, including the theme and home page. The `HomePage` class contains a button that, when pressed, triggers an alert dialog. This dialog displays a message and includes a button to close it. The flow is straightforward, demonstrating how to integrate a button from the `tdesign_flutter` package into a Flutter application while maintaining a clean and responsive UI.
