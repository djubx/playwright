# Tutorial: Setting Up Mews Pedantic

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **mews_pedantic** package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **mews_pedantic** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  mews_pedantic: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/mews_pedantic).

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Configuring Linting Rules

You can configure the linting rules by creating an `analysis_options.yaml` file in the root of your Flutter project. Hereâ€™s an example configuration:

```yaml
include: package:mews_pedantic/analysis_options.yaml

linter:
  rules:
    - prefer_single_quotes
    - always_declare_return_types
```

This configuration includes the default linting rules provided by **mews_pedantic** and adds a couple of custom rules.

## Step 4: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file is configured to use the latest version of the Kotlin plugin, as the package may rely on Kotlin features. Update the `build.gradle` file as follows:

```groovy
buildscript {
    ext.kotlin_version = '1.5.31' // Use the latest stable version
    dependencies {
        classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:$kotlin_version"
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your `ios/Podfile` is set to use the latest version of Flutter. You can do this by updating the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '12.0' # or higher
```

## Step 5: Using Mews Pedantic in Your Code

Once the package is set up, you can start using it in your Flutter application. The package will automatically enforce the linting rules you configured, helping you maintain code quality.

# Complete Example: Using Mews Pedantic

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mews_pedantic/mews_pedantic.dart'; // Importing the package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the main application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Mews Pedantic Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(), // Setting the home page
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Mews Pedantic Demo'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Welcome to Mews Pedantic!',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24), // Text style
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Spacing
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action when button is pressed
                showDialog(
                  context: context,
                  builder: (BuildContext context) {
                    return AlertDialog(
                      title: Text('Hello!'), // Dialog title
                      content: Text('This is a demo of Mews Pedantic.'), // Dialog content
                      actions: <Widget>[
                        TextButton(
                          child: Text('Close'), // Close button
                          onPressed: () {
                            Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close dialog
                          },
                        ),
                      ],
                    );
                  },
                );
              },
              child: Text('Show Dialog'), // Button text
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp has a title and a theme, and it sets MyHomePage as the home widget.
// 4. MyHomePage is a StatelessWidget that builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. The Center widget contains a Column with a welcome message and a button.
// 6. When the button is pressed, it shows a dialog with a message and a close button.
// 7. The close button dismisses the dialog when pressed.
```
