# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the "textfields" Package

## Installation
To use the "textfields" package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  textfields: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, make sure to enable the necessary permissions in your `Info.plist` if your text fields require any specific capabilities (like accessing the camera for input).

## Basic Usage
To use the "textfields" package, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:textfields/textfields.dart'; // Import the package
```

You can then create a simple text field as follows:

```dart
TextField(
  decoration: InputDecoration(
    labelText: 'Enter your name',
    border: OutlineInputBorder(),
  ),
);
```

This will create a basic text field with a label and an outline border. You can customize it further using the features provided by the package.

# Complete Example of Using the "textfields" Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:textfields/textfields.dart'; // Import the textfields package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Textfields Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Textfields Demo'), // App bar title
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0), // Padding around the text fields
          child: Column(
            children: [
              // First text field for name input
              TextField(
                decoration: InputDecoration(
                  labelText: 'Enter your name', // Label for the text field
                  border: OutlineInputBorder(), // Outline border style
                ),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 16), // Space between text fields
              // Second text field for email input
              TextField(
                decoration: InputDecoration(
                  labelText: 'Enter your email', // Label for the text field
                  border: OutlineInputBorder(), // Outline border style
                ),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 16), // Space between text fields
              // Third text field for password input
              TextField(
                obscureText: true, // Hide text for password input
                decoration: InputDecoration(
                  labelText: 'Enter your password', // Label for the text field
                  border: OutlineInputBorder(), // Outline border style
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Textfields Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold has a Padding widget to add space around the text fields.
// 5. Inside the Padding, a Column widget is used to arrange the text fields vertically.
// 6. Three TextField widgets are created for name, email, and password input, each with a label and an outline border.
// 7. The password field uses the obscureText property to hide the input text for security.
