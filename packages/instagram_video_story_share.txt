# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Instagram Video Story Share Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `instagram_video_story_share` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `instagram_video_story_share` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  instagram_video_story_share: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/instagram_video_story_share).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

3. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request permission for accessing the photo library:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to share videos to Instagram stories.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to save videos to your photo library.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to share a video to Instagram stories.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:instagram_video_story_share/instagram_video_story_share.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Instagram Video Story Share Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Path to the video file you want to share
              String videoPath = 'path_to_your_video.mp4';

              // Share the video to Instagram stories
              final result = await InstagramVideoStoryShare.shareToStory(videoPath);
              if (result) {
                // Successfully shared
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Video shared to Instagram stories!')),
                );
              } else {
                // Failed to share
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Failed to share video.')),
                );
              }
            },
            child: Text('Share Video to Instagram Story'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app with a button that, when pressed, shares a video to Instagram stories. Make sure to replace `path_to_your_video.mp4` with the actual path of the video you want to share.

# Complete Example of Instagram Video Story Share

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:instagram_video_story_share/instagram_video_story_share.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Instagram Video Story Share Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Path to the video file you want to share
              String videoPath = 'path_to_your_video.mp4';

              // Share the video to Instagram stories
              final result = await InstagramVideoStoryShare.shareToStory(videoPath);
              if (result) {
                // Successfully shared
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Video shared to Instagram stories!')),
                );
              } else {
                // Failed to share
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Failed to share video.')),
                );
              }
            },
            child: Text('Share Video to Instagram Story'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the `RealFlutter` widget, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The `MaterialApp` widget is created, providing the app structure.
// 3. A `Scaffold` widget is used to create the basic visual layout, including an AppBar and a body.
// 4. In the body, a centered `ElevatedButton` is displayed.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the app attempts to share a video to Instagram stories.
// 6. The path to the video is specified, and the `shareToStory` method is called.
// 7. If the sharing is successful, a SnackBar is shown indicating success; otherwise, it shows a failure message.
