# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `flutter_img`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `flutter_img` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and include the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_img: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to access the internet and read external storage. Add the following lines inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to add permissions in the `Info.plist` file to allow access to the photo library. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to display images.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to take pictures.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to load and display an image using the `flutter_img` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_img/flutter_img.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('flutter_img Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ImageWidget(
            imageUrl: 'https://example.com/image.jpg', // Replace with your image URL
            width: 300,
            height: 300,
            fit: BoxFit.cover,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays an image from a URL. The `ImageWidget` provided by the `flutter_img` package handles the image loading and caching automatically.

# Complete Example of `flutter_img`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_img/flutter_img.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('flutter_img Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          // Center widget to align the image in the middle of the screen
          child: ImageWidget(
            imageUrl: 'https://example.com/image.jpg', // URL of the image to be displayed
            width: 300, // Set the width of the image
            height: 300, // Set the height of the image
            fit: BoxFit.cover, // Set the box fit to cover
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  // Entry point of the application
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the Flutter application.
// 2. The runApp function takes the RealFlutter widget and makes it the root of the widget tree.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 4. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with a title and a body that centers an ImageWidget.
// 5. The ImageWidget fetches the image from the provided URL, caches it, and displays it with the specified dimensions and fit.
// 6. The application will display the image in the center of the screen when run.
```
