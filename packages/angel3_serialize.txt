# Angel3 Serialize: A Comprehensive Overview

The `angel3_serialize` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to simplify the process of serializing and deserializing data models. This package is particularly useful when working with APIs, as it allows for easy conversion between JSON and Dart objects. 

## When to Use `angel3_serialize`
- **API Integration**: When your Flutter application needs to communicate with RESTful APIs, `angel3_serialize` can streamline the process of converting JSON responses into Dart objects.
- **Data Persistence**: If your app requires saving and loading data in a structured format, this package can help manage the serialization of complex data models.

## Key Features
- **Automatic Serialization**: Automatically converts Dart objects to JSON and vice versa.
- **Customizable**: Allows for custom serialization logic, making it flexible for various data structures.
- **Type Safety**: Ensures that the data types are preserved during serialization and deserialization.
- **Support for Nested Objects**: Handles complex data structures with nested objects seamlessly.

Overall, `angel3_serialize` is an essential package for any Flutter developer looking to manage data efficiently in their applications.

# Getting Started with Angel3 Serialize

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `angel3_serialize` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter project.

## Installation

To add `angel3_serialize` to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  angel3_serialize: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/angel3_serialize).

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` file to allow network requests if you are fetching data from an API. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage

To use `angel3_serialize`, you need to define your data model and annotate it for serialization. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:angel3_serialize/angel3_serialize.dart';

part 'user.g.dart'; // Generated file

@serializable
class User {
  final String name;
  final int age;

  User(this.name, this.age);
}
```

After defining your model, run the build runner to generate the serialization code:

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build
```

This will create a `user.g.dart` file containing the serialization logic.

Now you can easily serialize and deserialize your `User` objects:

```dart
void main() {
  // Create a User object
  User user = User('Alice', 30);

  // Serialize to JSON
  Map<String, dynamic> json = user.toJson();

  // Deserialize from JSON
  User newUser = User.fromJson(json);
}
```

With these steps, you are now ready to use `angel3_serialize` in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Angel3 Serialize

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:angel3_serialize/angel3_serialize.dart';

part 'user.g.dart'; // Generated file

@serializable
class User {
  final String name;
  final int age;

  User(this.name, this.age);
}

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Angel3 Serialize Example',
      home: UserScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class UserScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a User object
    User user = User('Alice', 30);

    // Serialize the User object to JSON
    Map<String, dynamic> json = user.toJson();

    // Deserialize the JSON back to a User object
    User newUser = User.fromJson(json);

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('User Serialization Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Original User: ${user.name}, Age: ${user.age}'),
            Text('Serialized JSON: $json'),
            Text('Deserialized User: ${newUser.name}, Age: ${newUser.age}'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets UserScreen as the home widget.
// 3. UserScreen creates a User object with name 'Alice' and age 30.
// 4. The User object is serialized to JSON using the toJson method.
// 5. The JSON is then deserialized back into a new User object using fromJson.
// 6. The UI displays the original User, the serialized JSON, and the deserialized User.
