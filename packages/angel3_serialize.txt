In summary, the code flows as follows:

*   We define a data model class, `RealFlutter`, with a name and age.
*   We create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class and serialize it to JSON format using the `serialize` function.
*   We print the serialized JSON string to the console.
*   We deserialize the JSON string back to a `RealFlutter` instance using the `deserialize` function.
*   We print the deserialized name and age to the console to verify that the deserialization was successful.
