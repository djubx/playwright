# Setting Up the Package
-------------------------

To use the `flutter_auto_form` package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

Add the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  flutter_auto_form: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_auto_form/flutter_auto_form.dart';
```

### Step 3: Define Your Form Schema

Define your form schema as a JSON object:

```json
{
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "username",
      "type": "text",
      "label": "Username"
    },
    {
      "name": "email",
      "type": "email",
      "label": "Email"
    },
    {
      "name": "password",
      "type": "password",
      "label": "Password"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 4: Generate the Form

Use the `AutoForm` widget to generate the form:

```dart
AutoForm(
  schema: schema,
  onSubmit: (data) {
    // Handle form submission
  },
)
```

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_auto_form/flutter_auto_form.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Auto Form Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  final _schema = {
    "fields": [
      {
        "name": "username",
        "type": "text",
        "label": "Username"
      },
      {
        "name": "email",
        "type": "email",
        "label": "Email"
      },
      {
        "name": "password",
        "type": "password",
        "label": "Password"
      }
    ]
  };

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Auto Form Demo'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(20.0),
        child: AutoForm(
          schema: _schema,
          onSubmit: (data) {
            // Handle form submission
            print(data);
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user opens the app and is presented with a form generated by the AutoForm widget.
// 2. The form is generated based on the schema defined in the _schema variable.
// 3. The user fills out the form and submits it.
// 4. The onSubmit callback is called with the form data as an argument.
// 5. The form data is printed to the console.

// In a real-world application, you would replace the print statement with your own logic for handling the form submission.
// This could involve sending the data to a server, saving it to a database, or performing some other action.
