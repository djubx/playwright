class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Initialize the authentication system
  final _auth = QuicklyAuth();

  // Initialize the networking library
  final _network = QuicklyNetwork();

  // Initialize the storage library
  final _storage = QuicklyStorage();

              },
              child: Text('Login with Google'),
            ),
            // Registration button
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () async {
                // Use the authentication system to register
                final user = await _auth.registerWithEmailAndPassword('example@example.com', 'password');
                print(user);
              },
              child: Text('Register with Email/Password'),
            ),
            // Network request button
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () async {
                // Use the networking library to make a GET request
                final response = await _network.get('https://example.com');
                print(response);
              },
              child: Text('Make a GET request'),
            ),
            // Storage button
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () async {
                // Use the storage library to store a file
                final file = await _storage.storeFile('example.txt', 'Hello World!');
                print(file);
              },
              child: Text('Store a file'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user clicks on the login button, which triggers the authentication system to login with Google.
// 2. The authentication system redirects the user to the Google login page, where the user enters their credentials.
// 3. After the user logs in, the authentication system redirects the user back to the app, where the user is logged in.
// 4. The user can then click on the registration button, which triggers the authentication system to register with email and password.
// 5. The user can then click on the network request button, which triggers the networking library to make a GET request to the specified URL.
// 6. The user can then click on the storage button, which triggers the storage library to store a file.
// 7. The file is stored in the local storage, and the user can access it later.

// In summary, the "quickly" package provides a set of pre-built functionalities that can be easily integrated into an app, saving time and effort.
// The package includes an authentication system, a networking library, and a storage library, which can be used to implement common features such as login, registration, and file storage.
