# Tutorial: Setting Up the Animated Analog Clock Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `animated_analog_clock` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, you need to add the `animated_analog_clock` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  animated_analog_clock: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install Packages
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Import the Package
In your Dart file where you want to use the clock, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:animated_analog_clock/animated_analog_clock.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Clock Widget
You can now use the `AnimatedAnalogClock` widget in your widget tree. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
AnimatedAnalogClock(
  showSecondHand: true,
  showDigitalClock: true,
  width: 200.0,
  height: 200.0,
  decoration: BoxDecoration(
    color: Colors.white,
    shape: BoxShape.circle,
    boxShadow: [
      BoxShadow(
        color: Colors.black26,
        blurRadius: 10.0,
        spreadRadius: 2.0,
      ),
    ],
  ),
  numberColor: Colors.black,
  showNumbers: true,
);
```

This code snippet creates a circular analog clock with a digital display, shadow effects, and customizable colors.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the `animated_analog_clock` package into your Flutter application seamlessly.

# Complete Example of Animated Analog Clock

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_analog_clock/animated_analog_clock.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animated Analog Clock Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: ClockScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ClockScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Animated Analog Clock'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: AnimatedAnalogClock(
          showSecondHand: true, // Show the second hand
          showDigitalClock: true, // Show the digital clock below the analog clock
          width: 250.0, // Width of the clock
          height: 250.0, // Height of the clock
          decoration: BoxDecoration(
            color: Colors.white, // Background color of the clock
            shape: BoxShape.circle, // Shape of the clock
            boxShadow: [
              BoxShadow(
                color: Colors.black26, // Shadow color
                blurRadius: 10.0, // Blur radius of the shadow
                spreadRadius: 2.0, // Spread radius of the shadow
              ),
            ],
          ),
          numberColor: Colors.black, // Color of the numbers on the clock
          showNumbers: true, // Show numbers on the clock
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home of the MaterialApp is set to ClockScreen, which is another StatelessWidget.
// 4. In ClockScreen, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. The Center widget contains the AnimatedAnalogClock widget, which is configured to show the second hand and digital clock.
// 6. The clock is styled with a circular shape, white background, and shadow effects.
// 7. The application displays an animated analog clock with a digital clock below it, providing a stylish time display.
