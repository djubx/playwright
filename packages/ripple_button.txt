# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Ripple Button Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the ripple_button package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ripple_button: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Ripple Button

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using the Ripple Button in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ripple_button/ripple_button.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Ripple Button Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: RippleButton(
            onTap: () {
              // Action to perform on button tap
              print('Ripple Button Tapped!');
            },
            child: Text('Tap Me', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white)),
            rippleColor: Colors.blueAccent,
            shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(
              borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(10),
            ),
            padding: EdgeInsets.all(16),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with a Ripple Button in the center. The button prints a message to the console when tapped.

# Complete Example of Ripple Button

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ripple_button/ripple_button.dart';

// Main class of the Flutter application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Ripple Button Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: RippleButton(
            onTap: () {
              // Action to perform on button tap
              print('Ripple Button Tapped!'); // Log message to console
            },
            child: Text('Tap Me', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white)), // Button text
            rippleColor: Colors.blueAccent, // Color of the ripple effect
            shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(
              borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(10), // Rounded corners
            ),
            padding: EdgeInsets.all(16), // Padding around the button
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a centered Ripple Button.
3. The Ripple Button is configured with an onTap callback that prints a message to the console when tapped.
4. The button has a blue ripple effect, rounded corners, and padding for a better appearance.
5. When the user taps the button, the ripple effect is displayed, and the message "Ripple Button Tapped!" is logged to the console.
