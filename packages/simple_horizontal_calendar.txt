void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Simple Horizontal Calendar Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Horizontal Calendar Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // SimpleHorizontalCalendar widget to display the calendar
              SimpleHorizontalCalendar(
                onDateSelected: (date) {
                  // This callback is triggered when a date is selected
                  print("Selected date: $date");
                },
                initialDate: DateTime.now(), // Set the initial date to today
                // Customize the appearance
                selectedColor: Colors.blue, // Color for the selected date
                unselectedColor: Colors.grey, // Color for unselected dates
                textColor: Colors.white, // Text color for the dates
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Add some spacing
              Text(
                'Select a date from the calendar above',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter class builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title "Horizontal Calendar Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 5. A Column widget is used to stack the SimpleHorizontalCalendar and a Text widget vertically.
// 6. The SimpleHorizontalCalendar widget is instantiated with an onDateSelected callback that prints the selected date.
// 7. The initial date is set to the current date, and colors for selected and unselected dates are customized.
// 8. A Text widget below the calendar prompts the user to select a date.
// 9. The app is responsive and will adapt to different screen sizes, providing a smooth user experience.
