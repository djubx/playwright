# Dart Frog Flutter Package: An Overview

The `dart_frog` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to enhance their application's backend capabilities. It provides a robust framework for building server-side applications using Dart, allowing seamless integration with Flutter apps. This package is particularly useful for developers who want to leverage Dart's capabilities on both the client and server sides, ensuring a consistent development experience.

## When to Use Dart Frog

- **Full-Stack Dart Development**: If you're building a full-stack application using Dart, `dart_frog` allows you to write both the frontend and backend in the same language.
- **Real-Time Applications**: For applications requiring real-time data updates, such as chat apps or live dashboards, `dart_frog` provides efficient WebSocket support.
- **Microservices Architecture**: It is ideal for creating microservices due to its lightweight nature and ease of deployment.

## Key Features

- **Routing**: Simplified routing mechanisms to handle HTTP requests efficiently.
- **Middleware Support**: Allows the use of middleware for request processing, authentication, and more.
- **WebSocket Integration**: Built-in support for WebSockets to handle real-time communication.
- **Modular Design**: Encourages a modular approach to building server-side applications, making it easier to manage and scale.

# Setting Up Dart Frog in Your Flutter Project

In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of setting up the `dart_frog` package in a Flutter project and demonstrate its usage.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Flutter and Dart installed on your machine.
- Familiarity with Flutter development and basic server-side concepts.

## Installation

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add `dart_frog` as a dependency.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     dart_frog: ^1.0.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run `flutter pub get` to install the new dependencies.

## Platform-Specific Setup

### Android

- Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21.

### iOS

- Make sure your deployment target is set to iOS 10.0 or higher in your `ios/Podfile`.

## Basic Usage

1. **Create a Server**: In your Flutter project, create a new Dart file, e.g., `server.dart`.

2. **Set Up Routing**: Use `dart_frog` to define routes and middleware.

   ```dart
   import 'package:dart_frog/dart_frog.dart';

   void main() {
     final app = RealFlutter();

     app.get('/', (RequestContext context) {
       return Response.json(body: {'message': 'Hello, Dart Frog!'});
     });

     app.listen('localhost', 8080);
   }
   ```

3. **Run the Server**: Execute the server file using `dart run server.dart`.

# Complete Example: Flutter App with Dart Frog Backend

Below is a complete example of a Flutter application that uses the `dart_frog` package to handle backend operations.

```dart
// main.dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dart Frog Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  String _message = 'Fetching...';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _fetchMessage();
  }

  Future<void> _fetchMessage() async {
    // Send a GET request to the Dart Frog server
    final response = await http.get(Uri.parse('http://localhost:8080/'));

    // Check if the request was successful
    if (response.statusCode == 200) {
      setState(() {
        // Parse the JSON response and update the message
        _message = response.body;
      });
    } else {
      setState(() {
        _message = 'Failed to fetch message';
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Dart Frog Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          _message,
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// Application Flow Explanation
// 1. The `main.dart` file initializes the Flutter app and sets up the home page.
// 2. The `MyHomePage` widget is a stateful widget that fetches data from the Dart Frog server.
// 3. Upon initialization (`initState`), it calls `_fetchMessage` to retrieve data.
// 4. `_fetchMessage` sends an HTTP GET request to the server running on `localhost:8080`.
// 5. If the server responds with a status code of 200, the message is updated with the server's response.
// 6. The UI displays the message in the center of the screen using a `Text` widget.
