# Setting Up and Using the epubviewer2 Package

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `epubviewer2` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter project.

## Installation

To add `epubviewer2` to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  epubviewer2: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/epubviewer2).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    compileSdkVersion 31 // or latest
    ...
}
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Podfile`.
2. Uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

3. Run `pod install` in the `ios` directory to ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.

## Basic Usage

To use the `epubviewer2` package, you can create a simple widget that loads and displays an EPUB file. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:epubviewer2/epubviewer2.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('EPUB Viewer')),
        body: EpubViewer(
          filePath: 'assets/sample.epub', // Path to your EPUB file
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that displays an EPUB file using the `EpubViewer` widget. Make sure to place your EPUB file in the `assets` directory and declare it in your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/sample.epub
```

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the `epubviewer2` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using epubviewer2

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:epubviewer2/epubviewer2.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'EPUB Viewer Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('EPUB Viewer'),
        ),
        body: EpubViewer(
          filePath: 'assets/sample.epub', // Specify the path to your EPUB file
          onPageChanged: (page) {
            // Callback when the page changes
            print('Current page: $page');
          },
          onError: (error) {
            // Handle any errors that occur during loading
            print('Error loading EPUB: $error');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the app
}

/*
The application starts by running the RealFlutter widget.
1. The MaterialApp widget is created, which sets up the app's title and home screen.
2. The Scaffold widget provides a structure for the app, including an AppBar and body.
3. The EpubViewer widget is used to display the EPUB file located at 'assets/sample.epub'.
4. The onPageChanged callback is triggered whenever the user navigates to a different page, printing the current page number to the console.
5. The onError callback handles any errors that may occur while loading the EPUB file, allowing for better error management.
6. Finally, the main function runs the RealFlutter app, displaying the EPUB viewer to the user.
