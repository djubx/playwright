# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `svgaplayer_flutter`

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `svgaplayer_flutter` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `svgaplayer_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  svgaplayer_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/svgaplayer_flutter).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions if you plan to use network resources for your animations:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in a Flutter widget.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:svgaplayer_flutter/svgaplayer_flutter.dart';
```

2. Create a widget that uses the `SVGAPlayer`:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('SVG Animation Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: SVGAPlayer.network(
          'https://example.com/animation.svga', // Replace with your SVG animation URL
          width: 200,
          height: 200,
          placeholder: CircularProgressIndicator(), // Placeholder while loading
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Run your application to see the SVG animation in action!

With these steps, you can easily integrate SVG animations into your Flutter applications using the `svgaplayer_flutter` package.

# Complete Example of `svgaplayer_flutter`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:svgaplayer_flutter/svgaplayer_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'SVG Animation Example',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Create a controller for the SVG player
  late SVGAController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _controller = SVGAController();
    // Load the SVG animation from a network URL
    _controller.setVideoItem(SVGAParser().parseFromURL('https://example.com/animation.svga'));
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the controller when the widget is removed from the tree
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('SVG Animation Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: SVGAPlayer(
          controller: _controller,
          width: 200,
          height: 200,
          placeholder: CircularProgressIndicator(), // Placeholder while loading
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          // Play the animation when the button is pressed
          _controller.startAnimation();
        },
        child: Icon(Icons.play_arrow),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which manages the SVG animation.
// 3. In the initState method, an SVGAController is created and an SVG animation is loaded from a URL.
// 4. The SVGAPLayer widget is used to display the animation, with a placeholder shown while loading.
// 5. A FloatingActionButton is provided to start the animation when pressed.
// 6. The controller is disposed of in the dispose method to free up resources when the widget is removed.
```

In this complete example, we have created a simple Flutter application that demonstrates how to use the `svgaplayer_flutter` package. The application initializes an SVG animation and provides a button to start the animation. The comments within the code explain each part of the application flow, making it easy to understand how the package works and how to integrate it into your own projects.
