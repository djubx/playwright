# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Animated Marker

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **animated_marker** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  animated_marker: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions for internet access and location services:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you need to add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file to request location permissions:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show animated markers on the map.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show animated markers on the map.</string>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement animated markers.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:animated_marker/animated_marker.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:google_maps_flutter/google_maps_flutter.dart';
```

2. Create a `RealFlutter` class that extends `StatefulWidget` and implement the map with animated markers.

# Complete Example of Animated Marker

```dart
import 'package:animated_marker/animated_marker.dart'; // Import the animated_marker package
import 'package:flutter/material.dart'; // Import Flutter material package
import 'package:google_maps_flutter/google_maps_flutter.dart'; // Import Google Maps Flutter package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState(); // Create state for the widget
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late GoogleMapController mapController; // Controller for Google Map
  final LatLng _initialPosition = LatLng(37.7749, -122.4194); // Initial position (San Francisco)
  final Set<Marker> _markers = {}; // Set to hold markers

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _addAnimatedMarker(); // Add animated marker on initialization
  }

  // Function to add an animated marker
  void _addAnimatedMarker() {
    // Create an animated marker
    AnimatedMarker(
      markerId: MarkerId('animated_marker'), // Unique ID for the marker
      position: _initialPosition, // Initial position of the marker
      icon: BitmapDescriptor.defaultMarker, // Default marker icon
      onAnimationEnd: () {
        // Callback when animation ends
        print('Animation ended');
      },
    ).animateTo(
      LatLng(37.7849, -122.4094), // Target position for animation
      duration: Duration(seconds: 5), // Duration of the animation
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Animated Marker Example')), // App bar title
        body: GoogleMap(
          onMapCreated: (GoogleMapController controller) {
            mapController = controller; // Initialize map controller
          },
          initialCameraPosition: CameraPosition(
            target: _initialPosition, // Set initial camera position
            zoom: 14.0, // Set zoom level
          ),
          markers: _markers, // Set markers on the map
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget initializes the Google Map and sets the initial position.
// 3. In the initState method, the _addAnimatedMarker function is called to create and animate a marker.
// 4. The animated marker moves from the initial position to the target position over a duration of 5 seconds.
// 5. The Google Map is displayed with the animated marker, providing a dynamic user experience.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the **animated_marker** package. The application initializes a Google Map and adds an animated marker that moves from one location to another. 

### Summary of Application Flow
- The application starts by running the `RealFlutter` widget.
- The `GoogleMap` widget is created with an initial camera position.
- An animated marker is added to the map, which moves smoothly to a new location over a specified duration.
- The application provides a dynamic and engaging experience for users, showcasing the capabilities of the **animated_marker** package.
