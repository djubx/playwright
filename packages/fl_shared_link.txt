# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using fl_shared_link

## Installation
To get started with the `fl_shared_link` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  fl_shared_link: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/fl_shared_link).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following entries to allow link sharing:

```xml
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
    <string>your_custom_scheme</string>
</array>
```

## Basic Usage
Once you have installed the package and configured your project, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create and share a link:

```dart
import 'package:fl_shared_link/fl_shared_link.dart';

void shareLink() {
  final link = 'https://example.com';
  final title = 'Check this out!';
  
  // Use the fl_shared_link package to share the link
  FlSharedLink.share(link: link, title: title);
}
```

This function creates a link and shares it with a title. You can call this function from a button or any other widget in your app.

# Complete Example of fl_shared_link in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fl_shared_link/fl_shared_link.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Link Sharing Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Link Sharing Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Define the link and title to share
            final link = 'https://example.com';
            final title = 'Check this out!';

            // Call the shareLink function to share the link
            FlSharedLink.share(link: link, title: title);
          },
          child: Text('Share Link'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets HomeScreen as the home widget.
// 3. HomeScreen contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 5. When the button is pressed, it defines a link and a title, then calls FlSharedLink.share to share the link.
// 6. The user can share the link to any compatible application installed on their device.
