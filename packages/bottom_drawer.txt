# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Bottom Drawer Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **bottom_drawer** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **bottom_drawer** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  bottom_drawer: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 3: Using the Bottom Drawer

Now that we have set up the package, let's implement the bottom drawer in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to use the **bottom_drawer** package.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bottom_drawer/bottom_drawer.dart';
```

2. Create a StatefulWidget to manage the state of the bottom drawer.

3. Use the `BottomDrawer` widget to create the drawer interface.

4. Implement the logic to open and close the drawer.

This will be demonstrated in the complete example section below.

# Complete Example of Using the Bottom Drawer Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bottom_drawer/bottom_drawer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Bottom Drawer Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Create a GlobalKey to manage the BottomDrawer state
  final GlobalKey<BottomDrawerState> _bottomDrawerKey = GlobalKey<BottomDrawerState>();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Bottom Drawer Example'),
        actions: [
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.menu),
            onPressed: () {
              // Open the bottom drawer when the menu button is pressed
              _bottomDrawerKey.currentState?.open();
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Press the menu button to open the drawer.'),
      ),
      // Implement the BottomDrawer widget
      bottomNavigationBar: BottomDrawer(
        key: _bottomDrawerKey,
        // Customize the drawer's appearance
        backgroundColor: Colors.blueAccent,
        // Define the content of the drawer
        child: Column(
          mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,
          children: [
            ListTile(
              leading: Icon(Icons.settings),
              title: Text('Settings'),
              onTap: () {
                // Handle settings tap
                print('Settings tapped');
                _bottomDrawerKey.currentState?.close(); // Close the drawer
              },
            ),
            ListTile(
              leading: Icon(Icons.info),
              title: Text('About'),
              onTap: () {
                // Handle about tap
                print('About tapped');
                _bottomDrawerKey.currentState?.close(); // Close the drawer
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets MyApp as the home widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home screen.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that manages the state of the bottom drawer.
// 4. A GlobalKey is created to control the BottomDrawer's state.
// 5. The Scaffold widget contains an AppBar with a menu button to open the drawer.
// 6. The BottomDrawer widget is implemented in the bottomNavigationBar of the Scaffold.
// 7. The drawer contains a list of options (Settings and About) that can be tapped.
// 8. Tapping an option prints a message to the console and closes the drawer.
```
