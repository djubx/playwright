Here's a detailed technical blog on the "monarch" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Monarch Flutter Package

The **Monarch** package is a powerful tool for managing state and navigation in Flutter applications. It provides a simple yet effective way to handle complex state management scenarios, making it easier for developers to build scalable and maintainable applications. 

## When to Use Monarch

You should consider using the Monarch package when:
- You are building a Flutter application that requires complex state management.
- You need to manage navigation between multiple screens while maintaining the state.
- You want to simplify the process of handling user interactions and data flow in your app.

## Key Features
- **State Management**: Monarch allows you to manage the state of your application efficiently, ensuring that your UI reflects the current state of your data.
- **Navigation Handling**: It provides a seamless way to navigate between different screens while preserving the state.
- **Reactive Programming**: The package supports reactive programming paradigms, making it easier to respond to changes in the application state.

In summary, Monarch is an excellent choice for Flutter developers looking to streamline state management and navigation in their applications.

# Setting Up the Monarch Package

To get started with the Monarch package, follow these steps:

## Step 1: Add Dependency

First, add the Monarch package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  monarch: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the current version of the package.

## Step 2: Install Packages

Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0' # Ensure this is set to at least 10.0
```

## Step 4: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement Monarch in your app:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:monarch/monarch.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Monarch Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate to the next screen
            Monarch.navigate(context, SecondScreen());
          },
          child: Text('Go to Second Screen'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SecondScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Second Screen')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to the Second Screen!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with two screens. The `HomeScreen` contains a button that navigates to the `SecondScreen` using Monarch's navigation capabilities.

# Complete Example of Monarch in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:monarch/monarch.dart';

// Main entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// The main application widget
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Monarch Example',
      home: HomeScreen(), // Set the home screen
    );
  }
}

// Home screen widget
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home')), // App bar title
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate to the second screen using Monarch
            Monarch.navigate(context, SecondScreen());
          },
          child: Text('Go to Second Screen'), // Button text
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Second screen widget
class SecondScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Second Screen')), // App bar title
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to the Second Screen!'), // Display message
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application flow explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds the MaterialApp, setting the HomeScreen as the initial route.
// 3. The HomeScreen displays a button that, when pressed, uses Monarch to navigate to the SecondScreen.
// 4. The SecondScreen displays a simple message, demonstrating the navigation functionality provided by Monarch.
```

In summary, this blog post provided a comprehensive overview of the Monarch Flutter package, including its features, setup instructions, and a complete example demonstrating its usage. By following the steps outlined, developers can effectively implement Monarch in their Flutter applications, enhancing state management and navigation capabilities.
