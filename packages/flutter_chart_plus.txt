# Setting Up and Using Flutter Chart Plus

## Installation
To get started with `flutter_chart_plus`, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_chart_plus: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_chart_plus).

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use `flutter_chart_plus`, you can create a simple chart in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to implement a line chart:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_chart_plus/flutter_chart_plus.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Chart Plus Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: LineChart(
            data: [
              ChartData(x: 1, y: 5),
              ChartData(x: 2, y: 10),
              ChartData(x: 3, y: 15),
              ChartData(x: 4, y: 20),
            ],
            title: 'Sample Line Chart',
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple line chart with sample data points. The `LineChart` widget takes a list of `ChartData` objects, each representing a point on the chart.

With this setup, you can start building more complex charts and visualizations using the `flutter_chart_plus` package.

                ],
                title: 'Sample Line Chart', // Title of the chart
                xAxisLabel: 'X Axis', // Label for the X-axis
                yAxisLabel: 'Y Axis', // Label for the Y-axis
                lineColor: Colors.blue, // Color of the line
                pointColor: Colors.red, // Color of the data points
                showGrid: true, // Show grid lines
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between charts
              // Display a bar chart
              BarChart(
                data: [
                  ChartData(x: 1, y: 5), // Data point 1
                  ChartData(x: 2, y: 10), // Data point 2
                  ChartData(x: 3, y: 15), // Data point 3
                  ChartData(x: 4, y: 20), // Data point 4
                ],
                title: 'Sample Bar Chart', // Title of the chart
                barColor: Colors.green, // Color of the bars
                showValues: true, // Show values on top of bars
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation
// The application starts by importing necessary packages and defining the main class RealFlutter.
// Inside the build method, we create a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// The AppBar displays the title of the application.
// The body contains a Padding widget to add space around the charts.
// A Column widget is used to stack the charts vertically.
// The first chart is a LineChart, which takes a list of ChartData objects representing data points.
// We customize the line chart with titles, axis labels, and colors.
// Below the line chart, we add a SizedBox for spacing.
// The second chart is a BarChart, which also takes a list of ChartData objects.
// We customize the bar chart similarly with titles and colors.
// Finally, the main function runs the RealFlutter app, displaying both charts on the screen.
