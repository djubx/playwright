  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Dotted Line Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Above the Dotted Line'),
            FDottedLine(
              color: Colors.blue,
              strokeWidth: 2.0,
              dottedLength: 5.0,
              space: 3.0,
            ),
            Text('Below the Dotted Line'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Platform-Specific Details

- **iOS**: Similarly, no specific configurations are needed for iOS. The package works seamlessly across both platforms.

## Optimizations
- Ensure that you are using the latest version of the package for optimal performance and features.

# Complete Example of Using fdottedline_nullsafety

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fdottedline_nullsafety/fdottedline_nullsafety.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dotted Line Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Dotted Line Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Text widget above the dotted line
            Text('Above the Dotted Line'),
            // FDottedLine widget to create a dotted line
            FDottedLine(
              color: Colors.blue, // Set the color of the dots
              strokeWidth: 2.0, // Set the thickness of the line
              dottedLength: 5.0, // Length of each dot
              space: 3.0, // Space between the dots
            ),
            // Text widget below the dotted line
            Text('Below the Dotted Line'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the Text and FDottedLine widgets vertically.
// 5. The first Text widget displays a message above the dotted line.
// 6. The FDottedLine widget is used to create a dotted line with specified properties like color, stroke width, dotted length, and space.
// 7. Finally, another Text widget displays a message below the dotted line.
