# Overview of the snowflake_dart Flutter Package

The `snowflake_dart` package is a powerful tool designed for generating unique identifiers based on the Snowflake algorithm. This package is particularly useful in distributed systems where unique ID generation is crucial, such as in databases, microservices, and cloud applications. The Snowflake algorithm produces 64-bit integers that are unique across different nodes and time, making it an excellent choice for applications that require high scalability and performance.

## When to Use `snowflake_dart`
- **Distributed Systems**: When you need to generate unique IDs across multiple servers or instances.
- **Database Entries**: For creating unique primary keys in databases without the risk of collisions.
- **Microservices**: When services need to communicate and share unique identifiers without central coordination.

## Key Features
- **High Performance**: Generates IDs quickly and efficiently.
- **Time-Based**: The IDs are time-stamped, allowing for chronological sorting.
- **Node-Specific**: Supports multiple nodes, ensuring uniqueness across distributed environments.
- **Customizable**: Allows configuration of node IDs and sequence numbers.

# Setting Up and Using the snowflake_dart Package

## Installation
To use the `snowflake_dart` package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  snowflake_dart: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No specific configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package
To use the `snowflake_dart` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:snowflake_dart/snowflake_dart.dart';
```

You can then create an instance of the `Snowflake` class and start generating unique IDs:

```dart
void main() {
  // Create a Snowflake instance with a specific node ID
  final snowflake = Snowflake(nodeId: 1);

  // Generate a unique ID
  final uniqueId = snowflake.nextId();
  print('Generated Unique ID: $uniqueId');
}
```

This simple setup allows you to generate unique IDs quickly and efficiently.

# Complete Example of Using snowflake_dart

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:snowflake_dart/snowflake_dart.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Snowflake Dart Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Snowflake ID Generator'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: SnowflakeIdGenerator(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SnowflakeIdGenerator extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SnowflakeIdGeneratorState createState() => _SnowflakeIdGeneratorState();
}

class _SnowflakeIdGeneratorState extends State<SnowflakeIdGenerator> {
  // Create a Snowflake instance with a specific node ID
  final Snowflake snowflake = Snowflake(nodeId: 1);
  String uniqueId = '';

  void generateId() {
    // Generate a unique ID and update the state
    setState(() {
      uniqueId = snowflake.nextId().toString();
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Text(
          'Generated Unique ID:',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20),
        Text(
          uniqueId.isEmpty ? 'No ID generated yet' : uniqueId,
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20),
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: generateId,
          child: Text('Generate ID'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. The SnowflakeIdGenerator widget is displayed in the center of the screen.
// 4. Inside SnowflakeIdGenerator, a Snowflake instance is created with a node ID of 1.
// 5. When the "Generate ID" button is pressed, the generateId method is called.
// 6. This method generates a new unique ID using the snowflake instance and updates the state to display the new ID.
// 7. The generated ID is shown on the screen, and the user can generate a new ID by pressing the button again.
