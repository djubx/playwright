# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Weather Animation Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **weather_animation** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and include the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  weather_animation: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the weather animations.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:weather_animation/weather_animation.dart';
```

2. Create a widget that uses the `WeatherAnimation` class:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Weather Animation Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: WeatherAnimation(
          weather: WeatherType.sunny, // Change this to see different animations
          width: 200,
          height: 200,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Finally, run your application to see the weather animation in action!

# Complete Example of Weather Animation in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:weather_animation/weather_animation.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Weather Animation Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(), // Main widget for the app
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Weather Animation Example'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: WeatherAnimation(
          weather: WeatherType.sunny, // Set the weather type to sunny
          width: 200, // Width of the animation
          height: 200, // Height of the animation
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with MyApp().
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to RealFlutter, which is the main widget of the app.
// 4. RealFlutter builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a centered WeatherAnimation widget.
// 5. The WeatherAnimation widget displays an animation based on the specified weather type (sunny in this case).
// 6. You can change the weather type to other conditions like rainy, snowy, etc., to see different animations.
```
