# Overview of the `regexpattern` Flutter Package

The `regexpattern` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that simplifies the process of working with regular expressions. Regular expressions (regex) are sequences of characters that form a search pattern, primarily used for string matching and manipulation. This package provides a set of predefined patterns that can be easily integrated into your Flutter applications, making it easier to validate user input, parse strings, and perform complex text manipulations.

## When to Use `regexpattern`

You might consider using the `regexpattern` package in scenarios such as:

- **Form Validation**: Ensuring that user inputs like email addresses, phone numbers, and passwords meet specific criteria.
- **Data Parsing**: Extracting specific information from strings, such as URLs or hashtags.
- **Text Processing**: Performing operations like searching, replacing, or splitting strings based on patterns.

## Features

- **Predefined Patterns**: The package includes a variety of commonly used regex patterns, such as email, URL, and phone number patterns.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that allows for quick implementation in your Flutter projects.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

By leveraging the `regexpattern` package, developers can save time and reduce errors associated with manual regex creation and testing.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `regexpattern`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `regexpattern` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and include the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  regexpattern: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart files where you want to use the package, import it as follows:

```dart
import 'package:regexpattern/regexpattern.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

### Example Usage

Hereâ€™s how you can use the `regexpattern` package for validating an email address:

```dart
String email = "example@example.com";
bool isValidEmail = email.isValidEmail();
```

### Platform-Specific Details

- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid compatibility issues.
  
  ```groovy
  android {
      ...
      defaultConfig {
          ...
          minSdkVersion 21
      }
  }
  ```

- **iOS**: No specific configurations are required for iOS, but ensure that your deployment target is compatible with the Flutter version you are using.

## Step 4: Optimizations

For better performance, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex regex operations, consider:

- **Caching Results**: Store results of regex operations if they are used frequently.
- **Using Raw Strings**: When defining regex patterns, use raw strings (prefix with `r`) to avoid escaping backslashes.

```dart
String pattern = r'^[a-zA-Z0-9]+@[a-zA-Z]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'; // Raw string for email validation
```

By following these steps, you can effectively integrate and utilize the `regexpattern` package in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Using `regexpattern`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:regexpattern/regexpattern.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'RegExp Pattern Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('RegExp Pattern Example'),
        ),
        body: EmailValidationForm(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class EmailValidationForm extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _EmailValidationFormState createState() => _EmailValidationFormState();
}

class _EmailValidationFormState extends State<EmailValidationForm> {
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController();
  String _message = '';

  void _validateEmail() {
    // Get the email input from the controller
    String email = _controller.text;

    // Validate the email using the regexpattern package
    if (email.isValidEmail()) {
      setState(() {
        _message = 'Valid Email!';
      });
    } else {
      setState(() {
        _message = 'Invalid Email!';
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
      child: Column(
        children: [
          TextField(
            controller: _controller,
            decoration: InputDecoration(
              labelText: 'Enter your email',
              border: OutlineInputBorder(),
            ),
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20),
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: _validateEmail,
            child: Text('Validate Email'),
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20),
          Text(
            _message,
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16, color: Colors.red),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold containing an AppBar and the EmailValidationForm widget.
// 3. The EmailValidationForm widget maintains a state with a TextEditingController to capture user input and a message to display validation results.
// 4. When the user enters an email and presses the "Validate Email" button, the _validateEmail method is called.
// 5. This method checks if the entered email is valid using the isValidEmail() method from the regexpattern package.
// 6. Based on the validation result, the message is updated to inform the user whether the email is valid or invalid.
