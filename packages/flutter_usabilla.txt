# Tutorial: Setting Up flutter_usabilla

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **flutter_usabilla** package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the **flutter_usabilla** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_usabilla: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

3. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following entries to allow network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Initialize Usabilla

In your main Dart file, you need to initialize Usabilla with your project ID. This is typically done in the `main()` function or the `initState()` of your main widget.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_usabilla/flutter_usabilla.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize Usabilla with your project ID
    Usabilla.initialize('YOUR_PROJECT_ID');
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Usabilla Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Show Usabilla feedback form
            Usabilla.showFeedback();
          },
          child: Text('Give Feedback'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Using Usabilla

In the example above, we created a simple Flutter app with a button that, when pressed, opens the Usabilla feedback form. You can customize the feedback form and handle the responses as needed.

### Summary

In this tutorial, we covered the setup and configuration of the **flutter_usabilla** package for both Android and iOS platforms. We also demonstrated how to initialize Usabilla and show a feedback form in a Flutter application.

# Complete Example of flutter_usabilla

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_usabilla/flutter_usabilla.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Usabilla Feedback Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize Usabilla with your project ID
    Usabilla.initialize('YOUR_PROJECT_ID');
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Usabilla Feedback Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Show Usabilla feedback form
            Usabilla.showFeedback();
          },
          child: Text('Give Feedback'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is set as the home of the app.
// 4. In the HomeScreen's initState, Usabilla is initialized with the project ID.
// 5. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a centered button.
// 6. When the button is pressed, the Usabilla feedback form is displayed, allowing users to provide feedback.
```

### Summary of Application Flow

// The application starts with the `main()` function, which initializes the Flutter app. 
// The `MyApp` class sets up the main structure of the app, including the theme and home screen. 
// The `HomeScreen` class initializes Usabilla in its `initState()` method, ensuring that the feedback tool is ready to use. 
// The UI consists of a button that, when pressed, triggers the Usabilla feedback form, allowing users to submit their feedback directly from the app. 
// This flow provides a seamless user experience for collecting feedback, which is essential for improving the app based on user insights.
