# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Animated Icon Button Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `animated_icon_button` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  animated_icon_button: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Animated Icon Button

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the `AnimatedIconButton` in your widget tree.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_icon_button/animated_icon_button.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Animated Icon Button Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: AnimatedIconButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Action to perform on button press
              print('Button Pressed!');
            },
            icons: [
              Icons.favorite,
              Icons.favorite_border,
            ],
            duration: Duration(milliseconds: 300),
            curve: Curves.easeInOut,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with an animated icon button that toggles between a filled heart and an outlined heart when pressed.

# Complete Example of Animated Icon Button

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_icon_button/animated_icon_button.dart';

// Main class for the Flutter application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Animated Icon Button Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: AnimatedIconButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Action to perform on button press
              print('Button Pressed!'); // Log the button press
            },
            icons: [
              Icons.favorite, // Icon when the button is in the pressed state
              Icons.favorite_border, // Icon when the button is in the unpressed state
            ],
            duration: Duration(milliseconds: 300), // Duration of the animation
            curve: Curves.easeInOut, // Animation curve for smooth transition
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter application
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
3. Inside the Center widget, we place the AnimatedIconButton.
4. The AnimatedIconButton takes an onPressed callback, which is triggered when the button is pressed.
5. The button toggles between two icons: a filled heart and an outlined heart, providing visual feedback to the user.
6. The animation duration is set to 300 milliseconds, and the curve is set to easeInOut for a smooth transition.
7. When the button is pressed, "Button Pressed!" is printed to the console, demonstrating the action taken on press.
