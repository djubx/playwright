}

class _MonthYearPickerDemoState extends State<MonthYearPickerDemo> {
  // Variable to hold the selected month and year

      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Month Year Picker Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the selected month and year
            Text(
              selectedDate != null
                  ? 'Selected: ${selectedDate!.month}/${selectedDate!.year}'
                  : 'No date selected',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to open the month-year picker
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () async {
                // Show the month-year picker dialog
                final DateTime? picked = await showMonthYearPicker(
                  context: context,
                  initialDate: selectedDate ?? DateTime.now(),
                );
                // Update the state with the selected date
                if (picked != null && picked != selectedDate) {
                  setState(() {
                    selectedDate = picked;
                  });
                }
              },
              child: Text('Pick Month and Year'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application using the simple_month_year_picker package.
// 
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The MonthYearPickerDemo widget is a stateful widget that manages the selected date.
// 4. In the build method, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget containing:
//    - A Text widget that displays the selected month and year or a message if none is selected.
//    - An ElevatedButton that, when pressed, opens the month-year picker dialog.
// 5. The showMonthYearPicker function is called to display the picker, and the selected date is updated in the state.
// 6. The application flow allows users to select a month and year, which is then displayed on the screen.
