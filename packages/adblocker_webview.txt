# Adblocker Webview Flutter Package

The `adblocker_webview` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to integrate web views into Flutter applications while providing ad-blocking capabilities. This package is particularly useful for developers who want to display web content without the distraction of ads, enhancing user experience and performance.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the `adblocker_webview` package in scenarios such as:

- **Educational Apps**: For apps that provide resources from the web, ad-blocking can help users focus on the content.
- **Privacy-Focused Applications**: If your app emphasizes user privacy, blocking ads can prevent tracking scripts from running.

## Features

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Adblocker Webview Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `adblocker_webview` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  adblocker_webview: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

3. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to allow arbitrary loads:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the `adblocker_webview` in your app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:adblocker_webview/adblocker_webview.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Adblocker Webview Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Adblocker Webview Example'),
        ),
        body: AdblockerWebView(
          initialUrl: 'https://example.com',
          onPageFinished: (String url) {
            print('Page finished loading: $url');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that uses the `AdblockerWebView` widget to display a web page. The `onPageFinished` callback is used to perform actions after the page has finished loading.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the `adblocker_webview` package into your Flutter application successfully.

# Complete Example of Adblocker Webview

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:adblocker_webview/adblocker_webview.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Adblocker Webview Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Adblocker Webview Example'),
        ),
        body: AdblockerWebView(
          initialUrl: 'https://example.com', // The URL to load in the web view
          onPageFinished: (String url) {
            print('Page finished loading: $url'); // Log when the page has finished loading
          },
          onWebResourceError: (error) {
            print('Error loading page: $error'); // Handle any errors that occur during loading
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Start the application
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Adblocker Webview Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold includes the AdblockerWebView widget, which loads the specified URL.
// 5. The onPageFinished callback is triggered when the web page finishes loading, logging the URL to the console.
// 6. The onWebResourceError callback handles any loading errors, providing feedback in the console.
