# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using intl_phone_number_input

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `intl_phone_number_input` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `intl_phone_number_input` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  intl_phone_number_input: ^0.7.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:intl_phone_number_input/intl_phone_number_input.dart';
```

## Step 3: Configure for Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions for internet access:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

## Step 4: Configure for iOS

For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `Info.plist` file to allow for network requests:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 5: Using the Package

You can now use the `PhoneNumberInput` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
PhoneNumberInput(
  decoration: InputDecoration(
    labelText: 'Phone Number',
    border: OutlineInputBorder(),
  ),
  onChanged: (PhoneNumber number) {
    print('Phone number: ${number.phoneNumber}');
  },
),
```

This widget will display a text field with a dropdown for country codes. The `onChanged` callback provides the formatted phone number whenever the user changes the input.

## Step 6: Customization

You can customize the appearance of the input field by modifying the `decoration` property. You can also handle validation and formatting as per your requirements.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the `intl_phone_number_input` package into your Flutter application seamlessly.

# Complete Example of intl_phone_number_input

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:intl_phone_number_input/intl_phone_number_input.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Phone Number Input Example',
      home: PhoneNumberInputScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PhoneNumberInputScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PhoneNumberInputScreenState createState() => _PhoneNumberInputScreenState();
}

class _PhoneNumberInputScreenState extends State<PhoneNumberInputScreen> {
  PhoneNumber? _phoneNumber; // Variable to hold the phone number

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Phone Number Input'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            // Phone number input field
            InternationalPhoneNumberInput(
              onInputChanged: (PhoneNumber number) {
                setState(() {
                  _phoneNumber = number; // Update the phone number variable
                });
              },
              selectorConfig: SelectorConfig(
                selectorType: PhoneInputSelectorType.DROPDOWN, // Dropdown for country code
              ),
              ignoreBlank: false,
              autoValidateMode: AutovalidateMode.disabled,
              selectorTextStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.black),
              textFieldController: TextEditingController(),
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Phone Number',
                border: OutlineInputBorder(),
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to submit the phone number
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Print the formatted phone number
                print('Formatted Phone Number: ${_phoneNumber?.phoneNumber}');
              },
              child: Text('Submit'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp and the home screen.
// 3. PhoneNumberInputScreen is a StatefulWidget that manages the state of the phone number input.
// 4. The InternationalPhoneNumberInput widget is used to create the phone number input field.
// 5. When the user changes the input, the onInputChanged callback updates the _phoneNumber variable.
// 6. The user can submit the phone number by pressing the button, which prints the formatted phone number to the console.
