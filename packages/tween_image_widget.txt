# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Tween Image Widget

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `tween_image_widget` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  tween_image_widget: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Open the `Podfile` and uncomment the platform line, setting it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `TweenImageWidget`.

# Complete Example of Tween Image Widget

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tween_image_widget/tween_image_widget.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Tween Image Widget Example',
      home: TweenImageExample(),
    );
  }
}

class TweenImageExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _TweenImageExampleState createState() => _TweenImageExampleState();
}

class _TweenImageExampleState extends State<TweenImageExample> {
  // List of image URLs to transition between
  final List<String> _imageUrls = [
    'https://example.com/image1.jpg',
    'https://example.com/image2.jpg',
    'https://example.com/image3.jpg',
  ];

  // Current index of the image being displayed
  int _currentIndex = 0;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Tween Image Widget Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: TweenImageWidget(
          // The current image URL
          imageUrl: _imageUrls[_currentIndex],
          // Duration of the transition
          duration: Duration(seconds: 2),
          // Animation curve for the transition
          curve: Curves.easeInOut,
          // Callback to change the image after the transition
          onEnd: _nextImage,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to change to the next image
  void _nextImage() {
    setState(() {
      // Increment the index and loop back to the start if necessary
      _currentIndex = (_currentIndex + 1) % _imageUrls.length;
    });
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget.
// 3. The TweenImageExample widget is created, which manages the state of the image transition.
// 4. A list of image URLs is defined, and the current index is initialized to 0.
// 5. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a center widget containing the TweenImageWidget.
// 6. The TweenImageWidget takes the current image URL, transition duration, curve, and a callback function.
// 7. When the transition ends, the _nextImage function is called, which updates the current index and triggers a rebuild.
// 8. The app smoothly transitions between images based on the defined properties.
```
