# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_siri_suggestions

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_siri_suggestions` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_siri_suggestions` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_siri_suggestions: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_siri_suggestions).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following keys to enable Siri suggestions:

```xml
<key>NSUserActivityTypes</key>
<array>
    <string>NSUserActivityTypeBrowsingWeb</string>
    <string>NSUserActivityTypeMessage</string>
</array>
```

3. Ensure that your app has the necessary permissions to use Siri.

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` includes the necessary permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your Flutter application.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_siri_suggestions/flutter_siri_suggestions.dart';
```

2. Create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class and set up Siri suggestions:

```dart
class RealFlutter {
  void setupSiriSuggestions() {
    // Create a suggestion
    final suggestion = SiriSuggestion(
      title: 'Check your tasks',
      subtitle: 'You have 3 tasks due today',
      userInfo: {'taskCount': 3},
      type: SiriSuggestionType.action,
    );

    // Add the suggestion
    SiriSuggestions.addSuggestion(suggestion);
  }
}
```

3. Call the `setupSiriSuggestions` method at an appropriate point in your app, such as after a user completes a task.

With these steps, you can successfully integrate Siri suggestions into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of flutter_siri_suggestions

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_siri_suggestions/flutter_siri_suggestions.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Siri Suggestions Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Setting up Siri suggestions when the app starts
    setupSiriSuggestions();
  }

  void setupSiriSuggestions() {
    // Create a suggestion
    final suggestion = SiriSuggestion(
      title: 'Check your tasks',
      subtitle: 'You have 3 tasks due today',
      userInfo: {'taskCount': 3},
      type: SiriSuggestionType.action,
    );

    // Add the suggestion
    SiriSuggestions.addSuggestion(suggestion);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Siri Suggestions Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Siri Suggestions are set up!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and home set to RealFlutter.
// 3. In the RealFlutter widget, we override initState to set up Siri suggestions when the widget is initialized.
// 4. The setupSiriSuggestions method creates a Siri suggestion and adds it to the Siri suggestions list.
// 5. The build method returns a simple UI with a text indicating that Siri suggestions are set up.
