# Setting Up and Using the `file_icon` Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up the `file_icon` package in a Flutter project and demonstrate how to use it effectively.

## Setup Process

### Step 1: Add Dependency

First, add the `file_icon` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  file_icon: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the `file_icon` package:

```dart
import 'package:file_icon/file_icon.dart';
```

### Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android

No additional configuration is required for Android.

#### iOS

Ensure that your `Info.plist` file includes permissions for accessing files if your app needs to read from the device storage.

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to display file icons.</string>
```

## Using the Package

To use the `file_icon` package, you can call the `FileIcon` widget and pass the file extension as a parameter. Here's a simple example:

```dart
FileIcon(
  fileExtension: 'pdf',
  size: 48.0,
  color: Colors.blue,
)
```

This will display a PDF icon with a size of 48 pixels and a blue color.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:file_icon/file_icon.dart';

void main() => runApp(RealFlutter());

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'File Icon Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: FileIconDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class FileIconDemo extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('File Icon Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display a PDF icon
            FileIcon(
              fileExtension: 'pdf',
              size: 48.0,
              color: Colors.red,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Display a Word document icon
            FileIcon(
              fileExtension: 'docx',
              size: 48.0,
              color: Colors.blue,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Display an image file icon
            FileIcon(
              fileExtension: 'jpg',
              size: 48.0,
              color: Colors.green,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter as the root widget.
// RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// The home property of MaterialApp is set to FileIconDemo, which is another StatelessWidget.
// FileIconDemo builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange FileIcon widgets vertically.
// Each FileIcon widget is configured to display an icon based on the file extension provided.
// The icons are displayed with different colors and sizes to demonstrate customization options.
