# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Insta Assets Picker

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **insta_assets_picker** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **insta_assets_picker** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  insta_assets_picker: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/insta_assets_picker).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request permission to access the photo library:

   ```xml
   <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your photo library to select images and videos.</string>
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the **insta_assets_picker** in your app.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:insta_assets_picker/insta_assets_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Insta Assets Picker Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  // Function to pick assets
  void _pickAssets(BuildContext context) async {
    // Open the asset picker
    final List<AssetEntity>? result = await AssetPicker.pickAssets(
      context,
      // Allow multiple selection
      maxAssets: 9,
      // Specify the type of assets to pick
      requestType: AssetType.all,
    );

    // Check if any assets were selected
    if (result != null) {
      // Display the selected assets
      Navigator.push(
        context,
        MaterialPageRoute(
          builder: (context) => SelectedAssetsScreen(assets: result),
        ),
      );
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Insta Assets Picker Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () => _pickAssets(context), // Trigger asset picking
          child: Text('Pick Assets'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SelectedAssetsScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final List<AssetEntity> assets;

  SelectedAssetsScreen({required this.assets});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Selected Assets'),
      ),
      body: GridView.builder(
        gridDelegate: SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount(
          crossAxisCount: 3, // Display 3 assets per row
        ),
        itemCount: assets.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return AssetEntityImage(
            assets[index],
            // Set the width and height for the image
            width: 300,
            height: 300,
            fit: BoxFit.cover,
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` widget.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` widget builds a MaterialApp with a home screen.
// 3. The `HomeScreen` widget contains a button that, when pressed, calls the `_pickAssets` function.
// 4. The `_pickAssets` function opens the asset picker, allowing the user to select multiple images/videos.
// 5. If assets are selected, it navigates to the `SelectedAssetsScreen`, passing the selected assets.
// 6. The `SelectedAssetsScreen` displays the selected assets in a grid format.
```
