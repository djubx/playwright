# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Simple Location Picker

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the simple_location_picker package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Package to Your Project
To get started, you need to add the simple_location_picker package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  simple_location_picker: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/simple_location_picker).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that you have the following permissions in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/>
```

2. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21.

### iOS Configuration
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request location permissions:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show nearby places.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show nearby places.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that the package is set up, you can use it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the location picker.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simple_location_picker/simple_location_picker.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: LocationPickerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class LocationPickerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _LocationPickerScreenState createState() => _LocationPickerScreenState();
}

class _LocationPickerScreenState extends State<LocationPickerScreen> {
  String _selectedLocation = "No location selected";

  void _pickLocation() async {
    // Open the location picker
    final location = await showLocationPicker(
      context,
      initialLocation: LatLng(37.7749, -122.4194), // Default location
    );

    if (location != null) {
      setState(() {
        _selectedLocation = "Selected Location: ${location.latitude}, ${location.longitude}";
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Location Picker")),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text(_selectedLocation),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _pickLocation,
              child: Text("Pick a Location"),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Simple Location Picker

Here is a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the simple_location_picker package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simple_location_picker/simple_location_picker.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: LocationPickerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class LocationPickerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _LocationPickerScreenState createState() => _LocationPickerScreenState();
}

class _LocationPickerScreenState extends State<LocationPickerScreen> {
  String _selectedLocation = "No location selected"; // Variable to hold the selected location

  void _pickLocation() async {
    // Open the location picker
    final location = await showLocationPicker(
      context,
      initialLocation: LatLng(37.7749, -122.4194), // Default location set to San Francisco
    );

    if (location != null) {
      setState(() {
        // Update the selected location when a new location is picked
        _selectedLocation = "Selected Location: ${location.latitude}, ${location.longitude}";
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Location Picker")), // App bar with title
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center, // Center the column
          children: [
            Text(_selectedLocation), // Display the selected location
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Add space between text and button
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _pickLocation, // Call the location picker when button is pressed
              child: Text("Pick a Location"), // Button text
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The LocationPickerScreen widget is displayed as the home screen.
// 3. The user sees a button to pick a location and a text displaying the selected location.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the _pickLocation method is called.
// 5. The location picker opens, allowing the user to select a location on the map.
// 6. Once a location is selected, the state is updated, and the selected location is displayed on the screen.
```
