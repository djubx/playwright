# Tutorial: Setting Up Instabug in Your Flutter App

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `instabug_flutter` package and demonstrate how to use its features effectively.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `instabug_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  instabug_flutter: ^10.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Setup

### Android Setup

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
   ```

2. **Initialize Instabug**: In your `MainActivity.java` or `MainActivity.kt`, initialize Instabug in the `onCreate` method:

   ```java
   import com.instabug.library.Instabug;

   @Override
   public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
       super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
       Instabug.start(this, "YOUR_APP_TOKEN", InstabugInvocationEvent.NONE);
   }
   ```

### iOS Setup

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys:

   ```xml
   <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your photo library to attach screenshots.</string>
   <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your camera to attach screenshots.</string>
   ```

2. **Initialize Instabug**: In your `AppDelegate.swift`, initialize Instabug in the `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method:

   ```swift
   import Instabug

   @UIApplicationMain
   class AppDelegate: FlutterAppDelegate {
       override func application(
           _ application: UIApplication,
           didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?
       ) -> Bool {
           Instabug.start(withToken: "YOUR_APP_TOKEN", invocationEvents: [.shake])
           return true
       }
   }
   ```

## Step 3: Using Instabug

You can now use Instabug in your Flutter application. To invoke the feedback or bug reporting interface, simply call:

```dart
import 'package:instabug_flutter/instabug_flutter.dart';

// Call this method where you want to trigger the feedback collection
Instabug.showFeedback();
```

You can also customize the invocation events, such as using a shake gesture or a button press to trigger the feedback interface.

# Complete Example of Instabug in a Flutter App

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:instabug_flutter/instabug_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Instabug Flutter Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Instabug Flutter Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // This button triggers the Instabug feedback interface
            Instabug.showFeedback();
          },
          child: Text('Report a Bug or Feedback'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The HomePage widget is displayed as the home screen of the app.
// 3. The HomePage contains a button that, when pressed, invokes the Instabug feedback interface.
// 4. Users can then report bugs or provide feedback directly from the app, enhancing user engagement and improving the app's reliability.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application that integrates the `instabug_flutter` package. The application consists of a single button that, when pressed, opens the Instabug feedback interface. This allows users to report bugs or provide feedback seamlessly.

### Summary of Application Flow

- The application initializes and displays a home screen with a button.
- When the user presses the button, the Instabug feedback interface is triggered.
- Users can then submit their feedback or bug reports, which are sent directly to the developers, allowing for quick resolution and improved user experience.

By following this guide, you can effectively integrate the `instabug_flutter` package into your Flutter applications, enhancing your ability to gather user feedback and improve your app's quality.
