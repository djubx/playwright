// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a screen containing two text hover widgets.
// 2. When the user hovers over the first text hover widget, the text color changes to blue with 50% opacity.
// 3. When the user hovers over the second text hover widget, the text color changes to red with 75% opacity.
// 4. The hover effect is animated, providing a smooth transition between the default and hover states.
// 5. The user can adjust the hover animation duration to achieve the desired effect.

// In summary, the code flows as follows:
// 1. The user interacts with the text hover widgets, triggering the hover effect.
// 2. The hover effect is animated, providing a smooth transition between the default and hover states.
// 3. The text color and opacity are updated based on the hover effect's configuration.
