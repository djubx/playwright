# Exploring the `text_hover` Flutter Package

The `text_hover` package is a powerful Flutter library designed to enhance the user experience by providing hover effects on text widgets. This package is particularly useful for applications that require interactive text elements, such as buttons, links, or any text that needs to respond visually to user interactions. 

## When to Use `text_hover`
- **Interactive UI**: When you want to create a more engaging user interface with text that reacts to user actions.
- **Web Applications**: Ideal for Flutter web applications where hover effects are more common and expected.
- **Customizable Text Effects**: When you need to apply various styles or animations to text on hover.

## Key Features
- **Hover Effects**: Easily apply hover effects to any text widget.
- **Customizable Styles**: Modify text color, font weight, and other styles on hover.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS, as well as web applications.

With these features, `text_hover` allows developers to create visually appealing and interactive text elements that enhance the overall user experience.

# Setting Up and Using the `text_hover` Package

## Installation
To get started with the `text_hover` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  text_hover: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Usage
To use the `text_hover` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:text_hover/text_hover.dart';
```

### Platform-Specific Details
- **Android & iOS**: The package works out of the box without any additional configuration. Ensure that your Flutter SDK is up to date to avoid compatibility issues.
- **Web**: Hover effects are natively supported, but ensure that your web application is responsive to different screen sizes.

### Basic Example
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the `text_hover` package:

```dart
TextHover(
  text: 'Hover over me!',
  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, color: Colors.black),
  hoverStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, color: Colors.blue),
  onHover: (isHovered) {
    // Handle hover state
  },
)
```

In this example, the text changes color when hovered over, providing immediate feedback to the user.

# Complete Example of Using `text_hover`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:text_hover/text_hover.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Text Hover Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Text Hover Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: TextHover(
            text: 'Hover over me!',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.black),
            hoverStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.red, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
            onHover: (isHovered) {
              // Optional: Handle hover state if needed
              print(isHovered ? 'Hovered!' : 'Not hovered');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The above code creates a simple Flutter application with a centered text widget.
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'Text Hover Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 5. The child is a TextHover widget that displays the text 'Hover over me!'.
// 6. The text has a default style and a hover style that changes its color and weight when hovered.
// 7. The onHover callback prints the hover state to the console, providing feedback on the hover action.
// This demonstrates how to implement hover effects on text using the text_hover package effectively.
