# Overview of the `week_of_year` Flutter Package

The `week_of_year` package is a useful Flutter library that allows developers to easily calculate the week number of a given date. This can be particularly beneficial in applications that require scheduling, reporting, or any functionality that relies on week-based calculations. 

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the `week_of_year` package in scenarios such as:
- **Calendar Applications**: To display events or tasks organized by week.
- **Reporting Tools**: To generate weekly reports based on data collected throughout the week.
- **Scheduling Systems**: To manage appointments or tasks that are week-dependent.

## Features

- **Week Calculation**: Easily calculate the week number for any given date.
- **Customizable Start of Week**: Configure which day of the week should be considered the start (e.g., Sunday or Monday).
- **Leap Year Handling**: Correctly handles leap years when calculating week numbers.

The package is lightweight and easy to integrate into any Flutter application, making it a great choice for developers looking to add week-based functionality quickly.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the `week_of_year` Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `week_of_year` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  week_of_year: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:week_of_year/week_of_year.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

### Basic Usage

You can now use the package to calculate the week number of a date. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
void main() {
  DateTime date = DateTime.now(); // Get the current date
  int weekNumber = date.weekOfYear; // Calculate the week number
  print('Current week number: $weekNumber');
}
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

#### iOS

For iOS, make sure your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Optimizations

While the package is straightforward to use, consider the following optimizations:
- **Caching Results**: If you are calculating week numbers frequently, consider caching results to improve performance.
- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling for invalid dates to ensure your application remains robust.

With these steps, you should be able to successfully integrate and use the `week_of_year` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using the `week_of_year` Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:week_of_year/week_of_year.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Week of Year Example',
      home: WeekOfYearHome(),
    );
  }
}

class WeekOfYearHome extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Get the current date
    DateTime now = DateTime.now();
    // Calculate the week number for the current date
    int weekNumber = now.weekOfYear;

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Week of Year Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Current week number: $weekNumber', // Display the week number
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the Flutter application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget (WeekOfYearHome).
// 3. The WeekOfYearHome widget is a StatelessWidget that builds the UI.
// 4. Inside the build method, the current date is obtained using DateTime.now().
// 5. The week number is calculated using the weekOfYear extension provided by the package.
// 6. The week number is displayed in the center of the screen using a Text widget.
// 7. The AppBar displays the title of the application at the top of the screen.
