# Tutorial
==========

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process and explain how to use the `snapping_bottom_sheet` package.

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Pubspec.yaml File

To use the `snapping_bottom_sheet` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. You can do this by adding the following line to the `dependencies` section of your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  snapping_bottom_sheet: ^1.0.0
```
### Step 2: Import the Package

Once you have added the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file, you need to import it in your Dart file. You can do this by adding the following line to the top of your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:snapping_bottom_sheet/snapping_bottom_sheet.dart';
```
### Step 3: Create a Snapping Bottom Sheet

To create a snapping bottom sheet, you need to use the `SnappingBottomSheet` widget. You can do this by adding the following code to your Dart file:
```dart
SnappingBottomSheet(
  snappingPositions: [
    SnappingPosition(
      position: 0.0,
      snappingCallback: () {
        print('Snapped to position 0.0');
      },
    ),
    SnappingPosition(
      position: 0.5,
      snappingCallback: () {
        print('Snapped to position 0.5');
      },
    ),
    SnappingPosition(
      position: 1.0,
      snappingCallback: () {
        print('Snapped to position 1.0');
      },
    ),
  ],
  child: Container(
    height: 200.0,
    color: Colors.blue,
  ),
)
```
This code creates a snapping bottom sheet with three snapping positions. When the user snaps the bottom sheet to a position, the corresponding callback is called.

### Platform-Specific Details

The `snapping_bottom_sheet` package works on both Android and iOS platforms. However, there are some platform-specific details that you need to be aware of:

* On Android, the snapping bottom sheet is implemented using a `BottomSheet` widget. This means that the snapping bottom sheet will have a default elevation and will cast a shadow.
* On iOS, the snapping bottom sheet is implemented using a `UIView` widget. This means that the snapping bottom sheet will not have a default elevation and will not cast a shadow.

### Required Configurations or Optimizations

There are no required configurations or optimizations for the `snapping_bottom_sheet` package. However, you may want to consider the following:

* You can customize the snapping positions and animation duration to suit your needs.
* You can use the `SnappingBottomSheet` widget in combination with other widgets to create a custom bottom sheet.
