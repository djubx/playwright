The package is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to uniquely identify devices for ad tracking, without relying on personally identifiable information.

## When to Use the `advertising_id` Package

- **Ad Personalization**: Use the advertising ID to deliver personalized ads to users based on their preferences and behavior.
- **Analytics**: Track user engagement and ad performance across different devices.
- **User Segmentation**: Identify and segment users for targeted marketing campaigns.

## Key Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

# Setting Up and Using the `advertising_id` Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `advertising_id` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

First, add the `advertising_id` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  advertising_id: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Setup

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` includes the necessary permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID"/>
```

### iOS

For iOS, no additional setup is required. However, ensure that your app complies with Apple's privacy guidelines regarding advertising identifiers.

## Step 3: Implementing the Package

Create a new Dart file, `real_flutter.dart`, and import the package:

```dart
import 'package:advertising_id/advertising_id.dart';
```

Use the `RealFlutter` class to encapsulate the logic for fetching the advertising ID.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:advertising_id/advertising_id.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Advertising ID Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _advertisingId = 'Unknown';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _fetchAdvertisingId();
  }

  // Fetches the advertising ID asynchronously
  Future<void> _fetchAdvertisingId() async {
    String advertisingId;
    try {
      // Attempt to retrieve the advertising ID
      advertisingId = await AdvertisingId.id(true);
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during the fetch
      advertisingId = 'Failed to get advertising ID';
    }

    // Update the state with the retrieved advertising ID
    if (!mounted) return;
    setState(() {
      _advertisingId = advertisingId;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Advertising ID Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Advertising ID: $_advertisingId'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The application starts by running the `MyApp` widget.
// `MyApp` is a stateless widget that sets up the MaterialApp and its theme.
// The home screen of the app is set to the `RealFlutter` widget.
// `RealFlutter` is a stateful widget that manages the state of the advertising ID.
// In the `_RealFlutterState` class, the `_fetchAdvertisingId` method is called during initialization.
// `_fetchAdvertisingId` attempts to retrieve the advertising ID using the `AdvertisingId.id` method.
// If successful, the advertising ID is stored in the `_advertisingId` variable and displayed on the screen.
// If an error occurs, an error message is displayed instead.
// The UI consists of a simple `Scaffold` with an `AppBar` and a `Center` widget displaying the advertising ID.
