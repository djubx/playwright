Here's a detailed technical blog on the "cubes" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Cubes Flutter Package

The **Cubes** Flutter package is a powerful state management solution designed to simplify the development of complex applications. It provides a structured way to manage state and business logic, making it easier to build scalable and maintainable applications. The package is particularly useful for applications that require a clear separation of concerns, allowing developers to focus on building features without getting bogged down by state management complexities.

## When to Use Cubes

You should consider using the Cubes package in scenarios such as:

- **Complex Applications**: When your application has multiple features that require different states and business logic.
- **Team Collaboration**: In a team environment where different developers are working on different parts of the application, Cubes helps maintain a clear structure.
- **Scalability**: If you anticipate that your application will grow in complexity over time, using Cubes from the start can save you from refactoring later.

## Key Features

- **Separation of Concerns**: Cubes promotes a clean architecture by separating UI, state, and business logic.
- **Reactive Programming**: It leverages reactive programming principles, allowing the UI to automatically update in response to state changes.
- **Easy Integration**: The package can be easily integrated into existing Flutter applications with minimal setup.
- **Testability**: The clear separation of logic makes it easier to write unit tests for your application.

In summary, the Cubes package is an excellent choice for Flutter developers looking to implement a robust state management solution that scales well with application complexity.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Cubes Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the Cubes package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cubes: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/cubes).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Basic Setup

Now that you have added the dependency and configured your platforms, you can start using the Cubes package in your Flutter application.

1. **Create a Cube**: A cube is a class that holds the state and business logic. Create a new Dart file for your cube, for example, `my_cube.dart`.

```dart
import 'package:cubes/cubes.dart';

class MyCube extends Cube {
  // Define your state variables
  int counter = 0;

  // Define your business logic
  void increment() {
    counter++;
    notifyListeners(); // Notify listeners about the state change
  }
}
```

2. **Using the Cube in Your Widget**: You can now use your cube in a Flutter widget.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'my_cube.dart';

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final myCube = CubeProvider.of<MyCube>(context);

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Cubes Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Counter: ${myCube.counter}'),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: myCube.increment,
              child: Text('Increment'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. **Wrap Your App with CubeProvider**: Finally, wrap your main application widget with `CubeProvider` to provide the cube to the widget tree.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'my_cube.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    CubeProvider<MyCube>(
      create: (context) => MyCube(),
      child: MyApp(),
    ),
  );
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}
```

With these steps, you have successfully set up the Cubes package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Using the Cubes Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cubes/cubes.dart';

// Define the cube class that holds the state and business logic
class RealFlutterCube extends Cube {
  // State variable to hold the counter value
  int counter = 0;

  // Method to increment the counter
  void increment() {
    counter++; // Increment the counter
    notifyListeners(); // Notify listeners about the state change
  }
}

// Main function to run the app
void main() {
  runApp(
    // Wrap the app with CubeProvider to provide the cube to the widget tree
    CubeProvider<RealFlutterCube>(
      create: (context) => RealFlutterCube(), // Create an instance of the cube
      child: MyApp(), // Start the app
    ),
  );
}

// Main application widget
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Cubes Example',
      home: MyHomePage(), // Set the home page
    );
  }
}

// Home page widget
class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Access the cube instance
    final realFlutterCube = CubeProvider.of<RealFlutterCube>(context);

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Cubes Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display the current counter value
            Text('Counter: ${realFlutterCube.counter}'),
            // Button to increment the counter
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: realFlutterCube.increment, // Call the increment method
              child: Text('Increment'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application flow explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the CubeProvider.
// 2. The CubeProvider creates an instance of RealFlutterCube and provides it to the widget tree.
// 3. MyApp is the main application widget that sets MyHomePage as the home page.
// 4. MyHomePage accesses the cube instance using CubeProvider.of<RealFlutterCube>(context).
// 5. The current counter value is displayed, and pressing the "Increment" button calls the increment method in the cube.
// 6. The increment method updates the counter and notifies listeners, causing the UI to rebuild with the new counter value.
```
