      ),
      body: FutureBuilder(
        future: _loadPdfDocument(),
        builder: (context, snapshot) {
          if (snapshot.hasData) {
            // Create the PDF viewer
            return PdfViewer(
              document: snapshot.data,
              // Set the render quality
              renderQuality: PdfRenderQuality.high,
              // Enable page caching
              cachePages: true,
            );
          } else {
            // Show a loading indicator
            return Center(
              child: CircularProgressIndicator(),
            );
          }
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application flow:
// 1. The app starts and loads the PDF document from assets.
// 2. The PDF document is passed to the PdfViewer widget.
// 3. The PdfViewer widget renders the PDF document with high quality.
// 4. The user can zoom in and out of the PDF document and pan across the pages.
// 5. The user can navigate between pages in the PDF document.
// 6. The app displays a loading indicator while the PDF document is loading.
```

// Summary: The code flows as follows: the app starts and loads the PDF document from assets. The PDF document is then passed to the PdfViewer widget, which renders the PDF document with high quality. The user can interact with the PDF document by zooming in and out, panning across the pages, and navigating between pages. The app displays a loading indicator while the PDF document is loading.
