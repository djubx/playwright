// The app starts by creating a `GQLDedupeLink` instance and passing it to the GraphQL client.
// The GraphQL client is then used to make queries to the server.
// When the user presses the "Make Query" button, the app makes a query to the server using the GraphQL client.
// The query result is then printed to the console.
// When the user presses the "Make Duplicate Query" button, the app makes the same query again using the GraphQL client.
// However, because the `GQLDedupeLink` instance is caching the query results, the second query is not sent to the server.
// Instead, the cached result is returned, and the app prints the same result to the console again.

// This demonstrates how the `GQLDedupeLink` package can help eliminate duplicate queries and improve the performance of your app.
