# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Drag Speed Dial

## Installation
To use the drag_speed_dial package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  drag_speed_dial: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/drag_speed_dial).

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To implement the drag_speed_dial in your Flutter application, follow these steps:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:drag_speed_dial/drag_speed_dial.dart';
```

2. Use the `DragSpeedDial` widget in your widget tree. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
DragSpeedDial(
  animatedIcon: AnimatedIcons.menu_close,
  backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
  children: [
    SpeedDialChild(
      child: Icon(Icons.accessibility),
      label: 'Accessibility',
      onTap: () => print('Accessibility tapped'),
    ),
    SpeedDialChild(
      child: Icon(Icons.brush),
      label: 'Brush',
      onTap: () => print('Brush tapped'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

This code snippet creates a drag speed dial with two action buttons. You can customize the icons, labels, and actions as needed.

## Conclusion
The drag_speed_dial package is easy to set up and provides a modern way to handle multiple actions in your Flutter applications. Make sure to test the functionality on both Android and iOS to ensure a consistent user experience.

# Complete Example of Drag Speed Dial in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:drag_speed_dial/drag_speed_dial.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Drag Speed Dial Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Drag Speed Dial Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Press the button below!'),
        ),
        // Adding the DragSpeedDial widget to the floating action button area
        floatingActionButton: DragSpeedDial(
          animatedIcon: AnimatedIcons.menu_close, // Icon for the speed dial
          backgroundColor: Colors.blue, // Background color of the speed dial
          children: [
            // First action button
            SpeedDialChild(
              child: Icon(Icons.accessibility), // Icon for the first action
              label: 'Accessibility', // Label for the first action
              onTap: () => print('Accessibility tapped'), // Action on tap
            ),
            // Second action button
            SpeedDialChild(
              child: Icon(Icons.brush), // Icon for the second action
              label: 'Brush', // Label for the second action
              onTap: () => print('Brush tapped'), // Action on tap
            ),
            // Third action button
            SpeedDialChild(
              child: Icon(Icons.camera), // Icon for the third action
              label: 'Camera', // Label for the third action
              onTap: () => print('Camera tapped'), // Action on tap
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with a title and a Center widget displaying a message.
// 4. The floatingActionButton property of the Scaffold is set to a DragSpeedDial widget.
// 5. The DragSpeedDial widget has an animated icon and a blue background color.
// 6. It contains three SpeedDialChild widgets, each representing an action button with an icon and label.
// 7. Tapping on any of the action buttons triggers a print statement in the console.
