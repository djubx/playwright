// This is the main entry point of the app.
// The app initializes the Flutter FCM Wrapper package and sets up the notification and data message listeners.
// The app then runs the `MyApp` widget, which is the root of the app's widget tree.

// The `MyApp` widget is a stateless widget that builds the app's UI.
// The `MyHomePage` widget is a stateful widget that listens for incoming notifications and data messages.

// When a notification is received, the app prints the notification title to the console.
// When a data message is received, the app prints the data message data to the console.

// The app's UI is a simple scaffold with an app bar and a center-aligned text widget.

// This is the end of the main file example.
