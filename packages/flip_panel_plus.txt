# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Flip Panel Plus

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started with the **flip_panel_plus** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flip_panel_plus: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flip_panel_plus/flip_panel_plus.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Flip Panel Widget
You can now use the `FlipPanel` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
FlipPanel(
  front: Container(
    color: Colors.blue,
    child: Center(child: Text('Front', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white))),
  ),
  back: Container(
    color: Colors.red,
    child: Center(child: Text('Back', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white))),
  ),
  duration: Duration(milliseconds: 500),
  curve: Curves.easeInOut,
)
```

This code snippet creates a flip panel that shows "Front" on one side and "Back" on the other, with a smooth animation.

## Conclusion
With these steps, you can easily set up and use the **flip_panel_plus** package in your Flutter applications. Customize the panels as needed to fit your app's design and functionality.

# Complete Example of Flip Panel Plus

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flip_panel_plus/flip_panel_plus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flip Panel Plus Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flip Panel Plus Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: FlipPanelExample(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class FlipPanelExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _FlipPanelExampleState createState() => _FlipPanelExampleState();
}

class _FlipPanelExampleState extends State<FlipPanelExample> {
  // State variable to track the current panel
  bool _isFront = true;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return GestureDetector(
      // Flip the panel on tap
      onTap: () {
        setState(() {
          _isFront = !_isFront; // Toggle the panel state
        });
      },
      child: FlipPanel(
        // Front side of the panel
        front: Container(
          color: Colors.blue,
          child: Center(
            child: Text(
              'Front',
              style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24),
            ),
          ),
        ),
        // Back side of the panel
        back: Container(
          color: Colors.red,
          child: Center(
            child: Text(
              'Back',
              style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24),
            ),
          ),
        ),
        duration: Duration(milliseconds: 500), // Animation duration
        curve: Curves.easeInOut, // Animation curve
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets up the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a centered FlipPanelExample widget.
// 3. FlipPanelExample is a StatefulWidget that manages the state of the flip panel.
// 4. The _isFront variable tracks whether the front or back of the panel is currently displayed.
// 5. A GestureDetector wraps the FlipPanel, allowing it to respond to tap events.
// 6. On tap, the panel toggles between the front and back states, triggering a flip animation.
// 7. The FlipPanel widget displays either the front or back container based on the _isFront state, with a smooth transition.
