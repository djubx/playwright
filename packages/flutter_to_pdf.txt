# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `flutter_to_pdf`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_to_pdf` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_to_pdf: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_to_pdf).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to add the following to your `Info.plist` file to allow file access:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save PDFs.</string>
<key>NSDocumentsUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your documents to save PDFs.</string>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to create a PDF from a Flutter widget.

# Complete Example: Creating a PDF in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_to_pdf/flutter_to_pdf.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter to PDF Example',
      home: PDFGenerator(),
    );
  }
}

class PDFGenerator extends StatelessWidget {
  // Function to generate PDF
  Future<void> generatePDF() async {
    // Create a PDF document
    final pdf = Document();

    // Add a page to the document
    pdf.addPage(
      Page(
        build: (Context context) => Center(
          child: Text('Hello, Flutter to PDF!'),
        ),
      ),
    );

    // Save the PDF to a file
    final output = await getTemporaryDirectory();
    final file = File("${output.path}/example.pdf");
    await file.writeAsBytes(await pdf.save());

    // Notify the user
    print("PDF saved at ${file.path}");
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter to PDF Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            generatePDF(); // Call the PDF generation function
          },
          child: Text('Generate PDF'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app and sets MyApp as the home widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets PDFGenerator as the home screen.
// 3. PDFGenerator contains a button that, when pressed, calls the generatePDF function.
// 4. The generatePDF function creates a new PDF document and adds a page with a centered text.
// 5. The PDF is saved to the temporary directory of the device, and the file path is printed to the console.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

## Summary of Application Flow

The application starts by initializing the Flutter app and setting up the main widget. The `PDFGenerator` widget contains a button that triggers the PDF generation process. When the button is pressed, the `generatePDF` function is called, which creates a new PDF document, adds a page with a simple text, and saves the PDF to the device's temporary directory. The file path is printed to the console, allowing the user to know where the PDF is saved.

This example demonstrates the core functionality of the `flutter_to_pdf` package, showcasing how easy it is to generate PDFs from Flutter applications.
