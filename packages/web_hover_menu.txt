# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using web_hover_menu

## Installation
To get started with the `web_hover_menu` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  web_hover_menu: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/web_hover_menu).

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android and iOS
While `web_hover_menu` is primarily designed for web applications, it can be used in Flutter projects targeting mobile platforms. However, hover effects may not be as relevant on mobile devices due to the lack of mouse interactions. Therefore, consider using alternative navigation methods (like tap-based menus) for mobile users.

### Configuration
No additional configuration is required for Android and iOS. Just ensure that your Flutter environment is set up correctly and that you have the necessary dependencies installed.

## Usage
To use the `web_hover_menu` package, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:
   ```dart
   import 'package:web_hover_menu/web_hover_menu.dart';
   ```

2. Create a hover menu widget in your application:
   ```dart
   WebHoverMenu(
     items: [
       MenuItem(title: 'Home', onTap: () => print('Home tapped')),
       MenuItem(title: 'About', onTap: () => print('About tapped')),
       MenuItem(title: 'Contact', onTap: () => print('Contact tapped')),
     ],
   );
   ```

This will create a simple hover menu with three items. You can customize the appearance and behavior further as needed.

With this setup, you are ready to implement the `web_hover_menu` in your Flutter web application!

# Complete Example of web_hover_menu in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:web_hover_menu/web_hover_menu.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Web Hover Menu Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Web Hover Menu Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: WebHoverMenu(
            // Define the menu items
            items: [
              MenuItem(
                title: 'Home',
                onTap: () {
                  // Action for Home
                  print('Home tapped');
                },
              ),
              MenuItem(
                title: 'About',
                onTap: () {
                  // Action for About
                  print('About tapped');
                },
              ),
              MenuItem(
                title: 'Services',
                onTap: () {
                  // Action for Services
                  print('Services tapped');
                },
              ),
              MenuItem(
                title: 'Contact',
                onTap: () {
                  // Action for Contact
                  print('Contact tapped');
                },
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The above code sets up a simple Flutter application with a hover menu.
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Web Hover Menu Example".
// 4. In the body of the Scaffold, we center the WebHoverMenu widget.
// 5. The WebHoverMenu widget takes a list of MenuItem objects, each with a title and an onTap action.
// 6. When a menu item is tapped, it prints a message to the console indicating which item was selected.
// This example demonstrates how to create a basic hover menu with four items, showcasing the package's functionality.
