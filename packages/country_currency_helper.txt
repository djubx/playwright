# Complete Example of Using `country_currency_helper`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:country_currency_helper/country_currency_helper.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Country Currency Helper Demo',
      home: CurrencyDisplayScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class CurrencyDisplayScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Get a list of all countries
    List<String> countries = CountryCurrencyHelper.getAllCountries();

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Country Currency Helper'),
      ),
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: countries.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          String country = countries[index];
          // Get the currency code for the current country
          String currencyCode = CountryCurrencyHelper.getCurrencyByCountry(country);
          // Get the currency symbol for the current currency code
          String currencySymbol = CountryCurrencyHelper.getCurrencySymbol(currencyCode);

          return ListTile(
            title: Text(country),
            subtitle: Text('Currency: $currencyCode ($currencySymbol)'),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The CurrencyDisplayScreen widget is displayed as the home screen.
// 4. Inside CurrencyDisplayScreen, we retrieve a list of all countries using the package's method.
// 5. A ListView.builder is used to create a scrollable list of countries.
// 6. For each country, we retrieve the currency code and symbol using the package's methods.
// 7. Each country and its corresponding currency information is displayed in a ListTile.
// 8. The app provides a simple and effective way to view country and currency information.
