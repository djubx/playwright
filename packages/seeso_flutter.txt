# Seeso Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the **seeso_flutter** package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and include the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  seeso_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/seeso_flutter).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following keys to request camera and microphone access:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera for video calls.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio during video calls.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
Once you have installed the package and configured your project, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initialize and use the **seeso_flutter** package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:seeso_flutter/seeso_flutter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Seeso Video Streaming')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Initialize the video call
              SeesoFlutter.startVideoCall();
            },
            child: Text('Start Video Call'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app with a button that starts a video call when pressed. The `SeesoFlutter.startVideoCall()` method is called to initiate the video streaming.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and start using the **seeso_flutter** package in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Seeso Flutter Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:seeso_flutter/seeso_flutter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to hold the video call status
  bool isInCall = false;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Seeso Video Streaming')),
        body: Center(
          child: isInCall
              ? Column(
                  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
                  children: [
                    // Display the video call interface
                    SeesoFlutter.videoCallWidget(),
                    ElevatedButton(
                      onPressed: () {
                        // End the video call
                        SeesoFlutter.endVideoCall();
                        setState(() {
                          isInCall = false; // Update the state
                        });
                      },
                      child: Text('End Call'),
                    ),
                  ],
                )
              : ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () {
                    // Start the video call
                    SeesoFlutter.startVideoCall();
                    setState(() {
                      isInCall = true; // Update the state
                    });
                  },
                  child: Text('Start Video Call'),
                ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with a button to initiate a video call.
// 2. When the button is pressed, the `startVideoCall` method is called, and the state is updated to reflect that the user is in a call.
// 3. The UI changes to show the video call interface and an "End Call" button.
// 4. Pressing the "End Call" button calls the `endVideoCall` method and updates the state to show the initial button again.
