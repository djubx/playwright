# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `dart_pdf_reader`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `dart_pdf_reader` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dart_pdf_reader: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/dart_pdf_reader).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `Info.plist` file to allow for file access:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to select PDF files.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to scan documents.</string>
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:dart_pdf_reader/dart_pdf_reader.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the `dart_pdf_reader` package in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a PDF viewer.

# Complete Example of Using `dart_pdf_reader`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dart_pdf_reader/dart_pdf_reader.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'PDF Reader Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: PDFViewerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PDFViewerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PDFViewerScreenState createState() => _PDFViewerScreenState();
}

class _PDFViewerScreenState extends State<PDFViewerScreen> {
  // Variable to hold the PDF file path
  String pdfPath = 'assets/sample.pdf'; // Ensure this file is in your assets

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('PDF Viewer'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        // PDF viewer widget
        child: PDFViewer(
          filePath: pdfPath, // Path to the PDF file
          // Optional: Customize the viewer
          zoomable: true, // Allow zooming
          scrollDirection: Axis.vertical, // Scroll direction
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to PDFViewerScreen, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 4. In PDFViewerScreen, we define a variable pdfPath that holds the path to the PDF file.
// 5. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 6. Inside the Center widget, we use the PDFViewer widget, passing the pdfPath.
// 7. The PDFViewer displays the PDF file, allowing users to zoom and scroll through the document.
```

// The application flow is straightforward: it initializes the app, sets up the PDF viewer, and displays the specified PDF file. Users can interact with the PDF through zooming and scrolling, providing a smooth reading experience.
