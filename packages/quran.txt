# Setting Up the Quran Flutter Package

### Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **quran** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  quran: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/quran).

### Step 2: Install the Package

Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### For Android

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

#### For iOS

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following permissions if you plan to use audio features:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio features.</string>
```

### Step 4: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:quran/quran.dart';
```

### Step 5: Basic Usage

You can now start using the package in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to display a verse:

```dart
final verse = Quran.getVerse(1, 1); // Get verse 1:1
print(verse); // Output: In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
```

This setup will allow you to utilize the features of the **quran** package effectively in your Flutter applications.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
# Complete Example of Using the Quran Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:quran/quran.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Quran App',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: QuranHome(),
    );
  }
}

class QuranHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _QuranHomeState createState() => _QuranHomeState();
}

class _QuranHomeState extends State<QuranHome> {
  String verse = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Fetch the first verse of the Quran
    verse = Quran.getVerse(1, 1); // Get verse 1:1
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Quran App'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Verse 1:1',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(
              verse,
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18),
              textAlign: TextAlign.center,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Fetch the next verse (1:2)
                setState(() {
                  verse = Quran.getVerse(1, 2); // Get verse 1:2
                });
              },
              child: Text('Next Verse'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home screen is set to QuranHome, which is a stateful widget.
// 4. In the _QuranHomeState, the first verse (1:1) is fetched and displayed.
// 5. The UI consists of a title, the verse text, and a button to fetch the next verse.
// 6. When the button is pressed, the state is updated to show the next verse (1:2).
// 7. The app dynamically updates the displayed verse without needing to restart.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

### Summary of Application Flow

The application starts by initializing the `RealFlutter` widget, which sets up the main structure of the app. The `QuranHome` widget is displayed, fetching and showing the first verse of the Quran (1:1) upon initialization. The user can click the "Next Verse" button to fetch and display the next verse (1:2), demonstrating the dynamic capabilities of the app. The use of state management allows for seamless updates to the UI as the user interacts with the application.
