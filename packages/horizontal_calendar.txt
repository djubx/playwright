# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Horizontal Calendar Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the **horizontal_calendar** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  horizontal_calendar: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to set the platform version in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:horizontal_calendar/horizontal_calendar.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Horizontal Calendar
You can now use the `HorizontalCalendar` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
HorizontalCalendar(
  startDate: DateTime.now(),
  endDate: DateTime.now().add(Duration(days: 30)),
  onDateSelected: (date) {
    print("Selected date: $date");
  },
),
```

This code snippet creates a horizontal calendar that allows users to select dates from today to 30 days in the future.

## Conclusion
The **horizontal_calendar** package is easy to set up and provides a great user experience for date selection in Flutter applications. By following the steps above, you can integrate this package into your app and customize it to fit your needs.

# Complete Example of Using the Horizontal Calendar Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:horizontal_calendar/horizontal_calendar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Horizontal Calendar Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: CalendarScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class CalendarScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CalendarScreenState createState() => _CalendarScreenState();
}

class _CalendarScreenState extends State<CalendarScreen> {
  DateTime selectedDate = DateTime.now(); // Variable to hold the selected date

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Horizontal Calendar Example'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Horizontal Calendar Widget
          HorizontalCalendar(
            startDate: DateTime.now(), // Start date for the calendar
            endDate: DateTime.now().add(Duration(days: 30)), // End date for the calendar
            onDateSelected: (date) {
              setState(() {
                selectedDate = date; // Update the selected date
              });
            },
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between calendar and text
          Text(
            'Selected Date: ${selectedDate.toLocal()}'.split(' ')[0], // Display the selected date
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home screen is set to CalendarScreen, which is a stateful widget.
// 4. In CalendarScreen, we define a variable to hold the selected date.
// 5. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Column.
// 6. The HorizontalCalendar widget is created with a start and end date.
// 7. When a date is selected, the onDateSelected callback updates the selected date.
// 8. The selected date is displayed below the calendar in a Text widget.
```
