```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:jhijri_picker/jhijri_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override

}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  DateTime _selectedDate = DateTime.now();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('JHijriPicker Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text(
                'Selected Date: ${_selectedDate.toString()}',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              JHijriPicker(
                initialDate: _selectedDate,
                onDateChanged: (date) {
                  setState(() {
                    _selectedDate = date;
                  });
                },
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a screen displaying the current date.
// 2. The user can select a new date using the JHijriPicker widget.
// 3. When the user selects a new date, the onDateChanged callback is called with the new date.
// 4. The setState function is called to update the _selectedDate variable with the new date.
// 5. The UI is updated to display the new selected date.

// In summary, this code creates a simple app that allows the user to select a date using the JHijriPicker widget and displays the selected date on the screen.
