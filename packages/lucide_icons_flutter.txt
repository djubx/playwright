```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:lucide_icons_flutter/lucide_icons_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Lucide Icons Flutter Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Lucide Icons Flutter Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Display a home icon
              Icon(LucideIcons.home, size: 24),
              SizedBox(height: 16),

              // Display a settings icon with a custom color
              Icon(LucideIcons.settings, size: 24, color: Colors.blue),
              SizedBox(height: 16),

              // Display a list of icons
              Row(
                mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly,
                children: [
                  Icon(LucideIcons.user, size: 24),
                  Icon(LucideIcons.lock, size: 24),
                  Icon(LucideIcons.bell, size: 24),
                ],
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app, and the `RealFlutter` widget is created.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` widget builds a `MaterialApp` with a `Scaffold` as its home.
// 3. The `Scaffold` has an `AppBar` with a title, and a `Center` widget as its body.
// 4. The `Center` widget contains a `Column` with several children.
// 5. The first child is an `Icon` widget displaying a home icon.
// 6. The second child is an `Icon` widget displaying a settings icon with a custom color.
// 7. The third child is a `Row` widget containing several `Icon` widgets.
// 8. Each `Icon` widget displays a different icon.

// In summary, this code creates a simple Flutter app that displays several icons using the `lucide_icons_flutter` package.
