# Lottie Player Flutter Package

The **Lottie Player** Flutter package is a powerful tool that allows developers to render animations created in Adobe After Effects using the Lottie framework. This package is particularly useful for adding high-quality animations to Flutter applications without compromising performance. 

## When to Use Lottie Player

You should consider using the Lottie Player package in scenarios such as:
- **Onboarding Screens**: Enhance user experience with engaging animations during the onboarding process.
- **Loading Indicators**: Replace traditional loading spinners with animated graphics that can capture user attention.
- **Interactive UI Elements**: Use animations to make buttons, icons, and other UI components more dynamic and visually appealing.

## Features

- **High-Quality Animations**: Render complex animations smoothly.
- **Lightweight**: Lottie files are typically smaller than traditional image formats, which helps in reducing app size.
- **Customizable**: You can control playback speed, loop animations, and even manipulate properties of the animations programmatically.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.

With these features, the Lottie Player package is an excellent choice for developers looking to enhance their Flutter applications with animations.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Lottie Player

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the Lottie Player package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  lottie: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable the use of Swift in your project. Open your `ios/Podfile` and ensure that the platform is set to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using Lottie Player in Your Flutter App

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the Lottie Player:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:lottie/lottie.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Lottie Player Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Lottie.asset('assets/animation.json'), // Load your Lottie file here
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we load a Lottie animation from the assets folder and display it in the center of the screen.

# Complete Example of Lottie Player in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:lottie/lottie.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Lottie Player Example'), // Title of the app
        ),
        body: Center(
          // Center widget to align the animation in the middle of the screen
          child: Lottie.asset(
            'assets/animation.json', // Load your Lottie file from assets
            repeat: true, // Set to true to loop the animation
            animate: true, // Set to true to start the animation automatically
            width: 200, // Set the width of the animation
            height: 200, // Set the height of the animation
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the app
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the UI.
// 3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// 4. The AppBar displays the title of the application.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 6. The Lottie.asset method loads the animation from the specified asset path.
// 7. The animation is set to repeat and animate automatically, with specified dimensions.
// 8. Finally, the runApp function is called to launch the application.
```
