# Document Analysis Flutter Package

The `document_analysis` Flutter package is designed to facilitate the extraction and analysis of text from various document formats. This package is particularly useful for applications that require document scanning, text recognition, and data extraction from images or PDFs. 

## When to Use This Package
- **Document Scanning Apps**: If you're building an app that scans physical documents and extracts text, this package is a great choice.
- **Data Entry Automation**: For applications that automate data entry from documents, such as invoices or forms.
- **Text Analysis**: If you need to analyze text data from documents for insights or processing.

## Features
- **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**: Extracts text from images and PDFs.
- **Multi-format Support**: Works with various document formats, including images (JPEG, PNG) and PDFs.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that integrates seamlessly with Flutter applications.
- **Real-time Processing**: Capable of processing documents in real-time for immediate feedback.

Overall, the `document_analysis` package provides a robust solution for developers looking to implement document processing features in their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Document Analysis Package

## Installation
To add the `document_analysis` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  document_analysis: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version required
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the camera for document scanning.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to select documents.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `document_analysis` package, you can create a simple Flutter widget that allows users to capture or select a document and then analyze it.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:document_analysis/document_analysis.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Document Analysis Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Call the document analysis function here
            },
            child: Text('Analyze Document'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This basic setup provides a button to trigger document analysis. You can expand this by implementing the document selection and analysis logic.

# Complete Example of Document Analysis

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:document_analysis/document_analysis.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _extractedText = "No text extracted yet.";

  // Function to analyze the document
  Future<void> _analyzeDocument() async {
    // Simulate document selection (in a real app, you would use a file picker)
    final documentPath = 'path/to/your/document.png'; // Replace with actual path

    // Call the document analysis method
    final result = await DocumentAnalysis.analyze(documentPath);

    // Update the state with the extracted text
    setState(() {
      _extractedText = result.text; // Assuming result has a text property
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Document Analysis Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _analyzeDocument, // Trigger document analysis
                child: Text('Analyze Document'),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              Text(_extractedText), // Display extracted text
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 2. When the user presses the "Analyze Document" button, the _analyzeDocument function is called.
// 3. This function simulates selecting a document and calls the analyze method from the document_analysis package.
// 4. The result of the analysis is stored in the _extractedText variable.
// 5. The UI is updated to display the extracted text to the user.
```
