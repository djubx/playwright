# Setting Up and Using the `paged_vertical_calendar` Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up and using the `paged_vertical_calendar` package in a Flutter project. We will cover platform-specific configurations for both Android and iOS.

## Setup Process

1. **Add Dependency**

   First, add the `paged_vertical_calendar` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     paged_vertical_calendar: ^1.0.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**

   Run the following command to install the new package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configurations**

   - **Android**: Ensure your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

     ```gradle
     defaultConfig {
         minSdkVersion 21
     }
     ```

   - **iOS**: No specific configurations are required for iOS, but ensure your deployment target is set to iOS 9.0 or higher in your `ios/Podfile`:

     ```ruby
     platform :ios, '9.0'
     ```

## Using the Package

To use the `paged_vertical_calendar` package, import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:paged_vertical_calendar/paged_vertical_calendar.dart';
```

You can then use the `PagedVerticalCalendar` widget in your widget tree. Customize it as needed to fit your application's design.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:paged_vertical_calendar/paged_vertical_calendar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Paged Vertical Calendar Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: CalendarScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class CalendarScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Paged Vertical Calendar'),
      ),
      body: PagedVerticalCalendar(
        startDate: DateTime.now(),
        endDate: DateTime.now().add(Duration(days: 365)),
        onDayPressed: (date) {
          // Handle the day press event
          print('Selected date: $date');
        },
        dayBuilder: (context, date) {
          // Customize the appearance of each day
          return Container(
            alignment: Alignment.center,
            child: Text(
              '${date.day}',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
            ),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The `main` function is the entry point of the Flutter application.
// It calls `runApp` with an instance of `RealFlutter`, which is the root widget of the app.

// `RealFlutter` is a stateless widget that sets up the MaterialApp.
// It defines the app's title and theme, and specifies `CalendarScreen` as the home screen.

// `CalendarScreen` is a stateless widget that builds the main UI.
// It uses a `Scaffold` to provide a basic structure with an `AppBar` and a `PagedVerticalCalendar` widget.

// The `PagedVerticalCalendar` widget is configured with a start and end date.
// It includes an `onDayPressed` callback to handle user interactions with specific dates.
// The `dayBuilder` function customizes the appearance of each day in the calendar.

// The app displays a vertically scrolling calendar, allowing users to navigate through months.
// When a day is pressed, the selected date is printed to the console.
