# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using ml_card_scanner

## Installation
To get started with the `ml_card_scanner` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ml_card_scanner: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/ml_card_scanner).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

3. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request camera access:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the camera to scan cards.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the photo library to save scanned cards.</string>
```

## Using the Package
To use the `ml_card_scanner`, you can create a simple interface that allows users to initiate the scanning process. Below is a basic example of how to implement the scanner in your Flutter app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ml_card_scanner/ml_card_scanner.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Card Scanner')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Start the card scanning process
              final result = await MlCardScanner.scanCard();
              // Handle the scanned result
              if (result != null) {
                // Display the scanned card information
                showDialog(
                  context: context,
                  builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                    title: Text('Scanned Card Info'),
                    content: Text(result.toString()),
                    actions: [
                      TextButton(
                        onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                        child: Text('OK'),
                      ),
                    ],
                  ),
                );
              }
            },
            child: Text('Scan Card'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of ml_card_scanner

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ml_card_scanner/ml_card_scanner.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Card Scanner')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Start the card scanning process
              final result = await MlCardScanner.scanCard();
              // Handle the scanned result
              if (result != null) {
                // Display the scanned card information
                showDialog(
                  context: context,
                  builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                    title: Text('Scanned Card Info'),
                    content: Text(result.toString()),
                    actions: [
                      TextButton(
                        onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                        child: Text('OK'),
                      ),
                    ],
                  ),
                );
              }
            },
            child: Text('Scan Card'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which builds a MaterialApp.
// 2. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. The Center widget contains an ElevatedButton labeled 'Scan Card'.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the onPressed callback is triggered.
// 5. The MlCardScanner.scanCard() method is called to initiate the card scanning process.
// 6. If a card is successfully scanned, the result is displayed in an AlertDialog.
// 7. The AlertDialog shows the scanned card information and provides an 'OK' button to dismiss it.
