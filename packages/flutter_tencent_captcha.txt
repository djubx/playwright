## Key Features
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup process for both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Customizable UI**: Ability to customize the appearance of the CAPTCHA widget to match your app's design.
- **Real-time Verification**: Provides immediate feedback on user interactions.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_tencent_captcha

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_tencent_captcha` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `flutter_tencent_captcha` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_tencent_captcha: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_tencent_captcha).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions and metadata inside the `<application>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<application>
    ...
    <meta-data
        android:name="com.tencent.tcaptcha.APP_ID"
        android:value="YOUR_TENCENT_APP_ID"/>
    ...
</application>
```

Replace `YOUR_TENCENT_APP_ID` with your actual Tencent App ID.

### iOS Configuration
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following entries:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
    <dict>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
        <array>
            <string>YOUR_TENCENT_APP_ID</string>
        </array>
    </dict>
</array>
```

Replace `YOUR_TENCENT_APP_ID` with your actual Tencent App ID.

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is an example of how to implement the CAPTCHA in your app.

# Complete Example of flutter_tencent_captcha

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_tencent_captcha/flutter_tencent_captcha.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Tencent CAPTCHA Example',
      home: CaptchaExample(),
    );
  }
}

class CaptchaExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CaptchaExampleState createState() => _CaptchaExampleState();
}

class _CaptchaExampleState extends State<CaptchaExample> {
  // This function will be called when the CAPTCHA is successfully verified
  void _onVerify(String token) {
    // Handle the token received from the CAPTCHA verification
    print("CAPTCHA Verified: $token");
    // You can now proceed with your logic, such as logging in the user
  }

  // This function will be called when the CAPTCHA verification fails
  void _onError(String error) {
    // Handle the error received from the CAPTCHA verification
    print("CAPTCHA Error: $error");
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Tencent CAPTCHA Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () async {
            // Initialize the Tencent CAPTCHA
            final result = await FlutterTencentCaptcha.startCaptcha(
              appId: 'YOUR_TENCENT_APP_ID', // Replace with your Tencent App ID
              onVerify: _onVerify, // Callback for successful verification
              onError: _onError, // Callback for errors
            );

            // Check the result of the CAPTCHA
            if (result != null) {
              print("CAPTCHA Result: $result");
            }
          },
          child: Text('Show CAPTCHA'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation
// The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget sets up a MaterialApp with a title and a home page.
// The CaptchaExample widget is a stateful widget that contains the CAPTCHA logic.
// When the user presses the "Show CAPTCHA" button, the app calls the startCaptcha method.
// This method initializes the Tencent CAPTCHA with the provided App ID and sets up callbacks for verification and error handling.
// If the CAPTCHA is successfully verified, the _onVerify function is called, where you can handle the token.
// If there is an error during verification, the _onError function is called to handle the error.
// The app prints the results to the console for debugging purposes.
