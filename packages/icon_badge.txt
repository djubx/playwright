# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the `icon_badge` Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `icon_badge` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  icon_badge: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration
For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement an icon badge.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:icon_badge/icon_badge.dart';
```

2. Use the `IconBadge` widget to wrap your icon:

```dart
IconBadge(
  icon: Icon(Icons.notifications),
  itemCount: 5, // Number of notifications
  badgeColor: Colors.red, // Badge color
  onTap: () {
    // Handle badge tap
  },
)
```

This will display a notification badge on the icon with a count of 5.

# Complete Example of Using the `icon_badge` Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:icon_badge/icon_badge.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Icon Badge Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Icon Badge Example'),
          actions: [
            // Wrapping the icon with IconBadge to show notifications
            IconBadge(
              icon: Icon(Icons.notifications),
              itemCount: 3, // Example count of notifications
              badgeColor: Colors.red, // Color of the badge
              onTap: () {
                // Action when the badge is tapped
                print('Badge tapped!');
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(width: 20), // Spacing between icons
          ],
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Press the notification icon!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. In the AppBar, we use the IconBadge widget to display a notification icon with a badge.
// 5. The itemCount property of IconBadge is set to 3, indicating there are 3 notifications.
// 6. When the badge is tapped, it triggers the onTap callback, which currently prints a message to the console.
// 7. The body of the Scaffold contains a simple text widget prompting the user to press the notification icon.
