# Safemap Flutter Package: An Overview

The `safemap` Flutter package is a robust solution designed to handle map-related functionalities in a Flutter application with enhanced safety and ease of use. This package provides a set of tools that simplify the integration of maps into your Flutter app, ensuring that common pitfalls and errors are handled gracefully.

## When to Use Safemap

- **Error Handling**: If your application requires robust error handling when dealing with map data, `safemap` is an ideal choice.
- **Data Safety**: When you need to ensure that your map data operations do not result in null pointer exceptions or other runtime errors.
- **Ease of Use**: For developers looking to integrate map functionalities quickly without delving into complex configurations.

## Features

- **Null Safety**: Built-in null safety features to prevent common runtime errors.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that allows for quick setup and integration into existing projects.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Customizable**: Offers a range of customization options to tailor the map's appearance and behavior to your needs.

# Setting Up and Using the Safemap Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up the `safemap` package in a Flutter project and demonstrate how to use its features effectively.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

First, add the `safemap` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  safemap: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Setup

### Android

1. Ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following minimum SDK version:

   ```gradle
   minSdkVersion 21
   ```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
   ```

### iOS

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys:

   ```xml
   <key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
   <string>Your location is used to show nearby places.</string>
   ```

2. Ensure that your iOS deployment target is set to at least 11.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '11.0'
   ```

## Step 3: Using Safemap in Your Flutter App

Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:safemap/safemap.dart';
```

Initialize the `RealFlutter` class and configure it to display a map with basic functionalities.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:safemap/safemap.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Safemap Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MapScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class MapScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MapScreenState createState() => _MapScreenState();
}

class _MapScreenState extends State<MapScreen> {
  late RealFlutter _realFlutter;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the RealFlutter instance
    _realFlutter = RealFlutter();
    // Configure the map settings
    _realFlutter.initializeMap(
      onMapCreated: _onMapCreated,
      onError: _onError,
    );
  }

  void _onMapCreated() {
    // Callback when the map is successfully created
    print('Map has been created successfully.');
  }

  void _onError(String error) {
    // Handle any errors during map initialization
    print('Error initializing map: $error');
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Safemap Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: _realFlutter.buildMap(), // Build and display the map
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code sets up a basic Flutter application using the safemap package.
// It initializes the RealFlutter class, which is responsible for handling map functionalities.
// The map is displayed on the MapScreen widget, and callbacks are used to handle map creation and errors.

// Application Flow:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The MapScreen widget is the home screen, where the map is displayed.
// 3. In the _MapScreenState, the RealFlutter instance is initialized in initState.
// 4. The map is configured with callbacks for creation and error handling.
// 5. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget containing the map.
// 6. The map is displayed using the buildMap method of the RealFlutter instance.
