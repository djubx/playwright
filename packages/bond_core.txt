# Overview of the bond_core Flutter Package

The `bond_core` package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who need to implement secure and efficient data handling in their applications. It provides a robust framework for managing data binding, making it easier to synchronize data between different parts of your app. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to maintain a consistent state across various UI components or when dealing with complex data structures.

## When to Use bond_core

- **Data Synchronization**: When you need to keep multiple UI components in sync with a single source of truth.
- **State Management**: If your application requires a more structured approach to state management beyond what is provided by default in Flutter.
- **Reactive Programming**: For applications that benefit from reactive programming paradigms, allowing for more dynamic and responsive UIs.

## Key Features

- **Data Binding**: Simplifies the process of binding data to UI components.
- **Reactive Updates**: Automatically updates UI components when the underlying data changes.
- **Support for Complex Data Structures**: Handles nested data models efficiently.
- **Integration with Flutter's Widget Tree**: Seamlessly integrates with Flutter's existing widget system.

# Setting Up bond_core in Your Flutter Project

To get started with the `bond_core` package, follow these steps:

## Installation

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `bond_core` package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     bond_core: ^latest_version
   ```

   Replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/bond_core).

2. **Install Packages**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

- Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS

- For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

## Basic Usage

To use the `bond_core` package, you will typically create a data model and bind it to your UI components. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bond_core/bond_core.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a data model
    final model = DataModel();

    // Bind the model to the UI
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('bond_core Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(model.data),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DataModel extends Bond {
  String data = "Hello, bond_core!";
}
```

In this example, we create a simple data model and bind it to a text widget. When the data changes, the UI will automatically update.

# Complete Example of bond_core in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bond_core/bond_core.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create an instance of the data model
    final model = DataModel();

    // Bind the model to the UI
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('bond_core Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Display the current data
              Text(model.data),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Button to update the data
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Update the data in the model
                  model.updateData("Data Updated!");
                },
                child: Text('Update Data'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DataModel extends Bond {
  String data = "Hello, bond_core!";

  // Method to update the data
  void updateData(String newData) {
    data = newData; // Update the data
    notifyListeners(); // Notify listeners to update the UI
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds the UI, creating an instance of DataModel.
// 3. The UI displays the current data from the model.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the updateData method is called, changing the data.
// 5. notifyListeners() is called to trigger a UI update, reflecting the new data.
```
