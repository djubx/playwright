// The app starts by creating a Bond instance and registering the model and service.
// The model is a simple counter that notifies its listeners when the counter changes.
// The service is a simple class that increments the counter when its doSomething method is called.
// The app uses the Bond to get the model and service instances and register them with the Bond.
// The app then runs the MyApp widget, which displays the counter and a button to increment it.
// When the button is pressed, the service's doSomething method is called, which increments the counter.
// The model then notifies its listeners, which causes the app to rebuild and display the new counter value.
