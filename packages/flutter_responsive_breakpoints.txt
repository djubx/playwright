In summary, the `flutter_responsive_breakpoints` package provides a simple and intuitive way to define breakpoints for different screen sizes in Flutter applications. By using the `Breakpoint` widget and the `Breakpoint.of` method, you can access the current breakpoint value and return a widget tree based on the current screen size. This allows you to create responsive Flutter apps that can adapt to different devices and platforms.
