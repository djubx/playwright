# Flutter Responsive Breakpoints Package

The `flutter_responsive_breakpoints` package is a powerful tool designed to help Flutter developers create responsive layouts that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and orientations. This package simplifies the process of implementing responsive design by providing a set of breakpoints that can be easily integrated into your Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_responsive_breakpoints

## Installation
To get started with the `flutter_responsive_breakpoints` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_responsive_breakpoints: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package
To use the `flutter_responsive_breakpoints` package, you can wrap your widgets with the `ResponsiveBreakpoints` widget. This widget will provide the current breakpoint, allowing you to adjust your layout accordingly.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_responsive_breakpoints/flutter_responsive_breakpoints.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ResponsiveBreakpoints(
      child: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Responsive Breakpoints Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ResponsiveWidget(
            largeScreen: Text('Large Screen', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 30)),
            mediumScreen: Text('Medium Screen', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24)),
            smallScreen: Text('Small Screen', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18)),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `ResponsiveWidget` will display different text sizes based on the current screen size.

# Complete Example of flutter_responsive_breakpoints

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_responsive_breakpoints/flutter_responsive_breakpoints.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ResponsiveBreakpoints(
      child: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Responsive Breakpoints Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ResponsiveWidget(
            // Display different text based on screen size
            largeScreen: Text('Large Screen', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 30)),
            mediumScreen: Text('Medium Screen', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24)),
            smallScreen: Text('Small Screen', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18)),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// MyApp sets up the MaterialApp and specifies RealFlutter as the home widget.
// Inside RealFlutter, we use ResponsiveBreakpoints to manage responsive layouts.
// The ResponsiveWidget checks the current screen size and displays the appropriate text size.
// For large screens, it shows "Large Screen" with a font size of 30.
// For medium screens, it shows "Medium Screen" with a font size of 24.
// For small screens, it shows "Small Screen" with a font size of 18.
// This allows the app to adapt its UI based on the device's screen size, ensuring a better user experience.
