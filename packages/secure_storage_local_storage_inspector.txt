# Secure Storage Local Storage Inspector Flutter Package

The `secure_storage_local_storage_inspector` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to manage secure storage in their applications. This package provides a simple and effective way to store sensitive data locally on a device, ensuring that user information remains protected. 

## When to Use This Package
You should consider using this package when:
- You need to store sensitive user data, such as authentication tokens, passwords, or personal information.
- You want to ensure that the data is encrypted and secure, even if the device is compromised.
- You are developing applications that require compliance with data protection regulations.

## Features
- **Secure Storage**: Utilizes platform-specific secure storage mechanisms (Keychain for iOS and Keystore for Android).
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that allows for quick setup and usage.
- **Data Encryption**: Automatically encrypts data before storing it, ensuring that it is safe from unauthorized access.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices.

This package is ideal for developers who prioritize security and want to implement best practices for data storage in their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Secure Storage Local Storage Inspector

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `secure_storage_local_storage_inspector` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  secure_storage_local_storage_inspector: ^1.0.0
```

## Step 2: Install the Package
Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Using the Package
Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in our Flutter application.

### Example Usage
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the `secure_storage_local_storage_inspector` package to store and retrieve data securely:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:secure_storage_local_storage_inspector/secure_storage_local_storage_inspector.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  final SecureStorage secureStorage = SecureStorage();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Secure Storage Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Store data securely
              await secureStorage.write(key: 'token', value: 'my_secure_token');
              // Retrieve data securely
              String? token = await secureStorage.read(key: 'token');
              print('Retrieved token: $token');
            },
            child: Text('Store and Retrieve Token'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that allows users to store and retrieve a secure token. The `SecureStorage` class handles the encryption and storage of the data.

# Complete Example of Secure Storage Local Storage Inspector

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:secure_storage_local_storage_inspector/secure_storage_local_storage_inspector.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  // Create an instance of SecureStorage to manage secure data
  final SecureStorage secureStorage = SecureStorage();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Secure Storage Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Store data securely
              await secureStorage.write(key: 'token', value: 'my_secure_token');
              // Retrieve data securely
              String? token = await secureStorage.read(key: 'token');
              // Print the retrieved token to the console
              print('Retrieved token: $token');
            },
            child: Text('Store and Retrieve Token'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. An instance of SecureStorage is created to handle secure data storage.
// 3. The main UI consists of a button that, when pressed, performs the following actions:
//    a. It stores a secure token using the write method of SecureStorage.
//    b. It retrieves the stored token using the read method of SecureStorage.
//    c. Finally, it prints the retrieved token to the console for verification.
```
