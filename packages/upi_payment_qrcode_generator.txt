# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the UPI Payment QR Code Generator

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `upi_payment_qrcode_generator` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  upi_payment_qrcode_generator: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:
   ```xml
   <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your photo library to save QR codes.</string>
   ```

2. Ensure that your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in `ios/Podfile`:
   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have configured your project, you can start using the package to generate UPI QR codes.

### Example Usage
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to generate a UPI QR code in your Flutter application:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:upi_payment_qrcode_generator/upi_payment_qrcode_generator.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('UPI QR Code Generator')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Define the UPI payment details
              String upiId = "example@upi";
              String amount = "10.00";
              String name = "John Doe";
              String transactionNote = "Payment for services";

              // Generate the QR code
              String qrCode = await UpiPaymentQRCodeGenerator.generate(
                upiId: upiId,
                amount: amount,
                name: name,
                transactionNote: transactionNote,
              );

              // Display the QR code
              showDialog(
                context: context,
                builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                  title: Text("UPI QR Code"),
                  content: Image.network(qrCode),
                  actions: [
                    TextButton(
                      onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                      child: Text("Close"),
                    ),
                  ],
                ),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Generate QR Code'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

# Complete Example: UPI Payment QR Code Generator

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:upi_payment_qrcode_generator/upi_payment_qrcode_generator.dart';

// Main class for the Flutter application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('UPI QR Code Generator')),

              String upiId = "example@upi"; // UPI ID of the recipient
              String amount = "10.00"; // Amount to be paid
              String name = "John Doe"; // Name of the recipient
              String transactionNote = "Payment for services"; // Transaction note

              // Generate the QR code
              String qrCode = await UpiPaymentQRCodeGenerator.generate(
                upiId: upiId,
                amount: amount,
                name: name,
                transactionNote: transactionNote,
              );

              // Display the QR code in a dialog
              showDialog(
                context: context,
                builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                  title: Text("UPI QR Code"), // Title of the dialog
                  content: Image.network(qrCode), // Display the generated QR code
                  actions: [
                    TextButton(
                      onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(), // Close the dialog
                      child: Text("Close"),
                    ),
                  ],
                ),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Generate QR Code'), // Button text
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` widget.
2. The `RealFlutter` widget builds a simple UI with an AppBar and a button.
3. When the button is pressed, it defines the UPI payment details such as UPI ID, amount, recipient name, and transaction note.
4. It then calls the `generate` method from the `upi_payment_qrcode_generator` package to create a QR code.
5. Once the QR code is generated, it is displayed in a dialog box as an image.
6. The user can close the dialog by pressing the "Close" button.
