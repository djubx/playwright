# Animated Switcher Plus: A Flutter Package Overview

The `animated_switcher_plus` package is a powerful Flutter library designed to enhance the default `AnimatedSwitcher` widget by providing additional features and customization options. This package is particularly useful when you need to animate between widgets with more complex transitions and effects than the standard `AnimatedSwitcher` allows.

## When to Use Animated Switcher Plus

- **Complex Transitions**: When your application requires more sophisticated animations between widget transitions.
- **Customizable Animations**: If you need to customize the animation duration, curve, or type beyond the default options.
- **Performance Optimization**: For applications that require smooth animations without compromising performance.

## Key Features

- **Custom Animation Curves**: Allows the use of custom curves for animations, providing more control over the animation flow.
- **Flexible Duration**: Offers the ability to set different durations for different transitions.
- **Multiple Transition Types**: Supports various transition types, such as fade, scale, and slide, which can be combined for unique effects.
- **Ease of Use**: Simple API that integrates seamlessly with existing Flutter applications.

# Complete Example: Flutter Main File

Below is a complete example demonstrating the key features of the `animated_switcher_plus` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_switcher_plus/animated_switcher_plus.dart';

void main() => runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animated Switcher Plus Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  bool _isFirstWidget = true;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Animated Switcher Plus Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: AnimatedSwitcherPlus(
          duration: Duration(seconds: 1),
          transitionBuilder: (child, animation) {
            // Using a fade transition for the animation
            return FadeTransition(opacity: animation, child: child);
          },
          child: _isFirstWidget
              ? Container(
                  key: ValueKey(1),
                  width: 200,
                  height: 200,
                  color: Colors.blue,
                  alignment: Alignment.center,
                  child: Text(
                    'First Widget',
                    style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
                  ),
                )
              : Container(
                  key: ValueKey(2),
                  width: 200,
                  height: 200,
                  color: Colors.red,
                  alignment: Alignment.center,
                  child: Text(
                    'Second Widget',
                    style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
                  ),
                ),
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          // Toggle between the first and second widget
          setState(() {
            _isFirstWidget = !_isFirstWidget;
          });
        },
        child: Icon(Icons.swap_horiz),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the `MyApp` widget, which sets up the MaterialApp and home screen.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` widget is a stateful widget that manages the state of which widget to display.
// 3. The `AnimatedSwitcherPlus` widget is used to animate transitions between two containers.
// 4. The `transitionBuilder` uses a `FadeTransition` to animate the opacity of the widgets.
// 5. A `FloatingActionButton` is provided to toggle between the two widgets, triggering the animation.
// 6. The `setState` method is called to update the `_isFirstWidget` boolean, which determines which widget is displayed.
