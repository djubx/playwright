# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Shrinking View Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **shrinking_view** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  shrinking_view: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Shrinking View

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the **shrinking_view** in your app.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:shrinking_view/shrinking_view.dart';
```

2. Create a simple UI using the `ShrinkingView` widget:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Shrinking View Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ShrinkingView(
            child: Column(
              children: [
                Text('Tap to Expand/Collapse'),
                // Add more widgets here
              ],
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Run your application:

```bash
flutter run
```

This will launch your app with a basic implementation of the **shrinking_view** package.

# Complete Example of the Shrinking View Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:shrinking_view/shrinking_view.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Shrinking View Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ShrinkingView(
            // The ShrinkingView widget wraps the content that can expand or collapse
            child: Column(
              mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min, // Minimize the size of the column
              children: [
                GestureDetector(
                  // Detects taps on the text to expand/collapse
                  onTap: () {
                    // Trigger the expansion or collapse
                  },
                  child: Container(
                    padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
                    color: Colors.blue,
                    child: Text(
                      'Tap to Expand/Collapse',
                      style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 18),
                    ),
                  ),
                ),
                // This container will expand/collapse based on the ShrinkingView
                Container(
                  padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
                  color: Colors.grey[300],
                  child: Text(
                    'This is the content that will be shown or hidden.',
                    style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
                  ),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, a ShrinkingView is created, which allows its child to expand or collapse.
// 4. The child of ShrinkingView is a Column containing a GestureDetector and a Container.
// 5. The GestureDetector listens for taps and can trigger the expansion or collapse of the content.
// 6. The Container below the GestureDetector holds the content that will be shown or hidden based on user interaction.
```
