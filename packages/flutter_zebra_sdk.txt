# Flutter Zebra SDK: A Comprehensive Overview

The `flutter_zebra_sdk` package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who need to integrate Zebra Technologies' mobile printing and scanning capabilities into their applications. This package provides a seamless way to interact with Zebra printers and scanners, enabling developers to create robust applications that can handle various printing and scanning tasks.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `flutter_zebra_sdk` package in scenarios such as:

- **Mobile Point of Sale (POS) Systems**: When building applications that require printing receipts or invoices directly from mobile devices.
- **Inventory Management**: For applications that need to scan barcodes and print labels on the go.
- **Field Service Applications**: When technicians need to print service reports or invoices while on-site.

## Key Features

- **Printer Connectivity**: Easily connect to Zebra printers via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.
- **Barcode Scanning**: Integrate barcode scanning functionality to read various barcode formats.
- **Label Printing**: Print labels with customizable formats and layouts.
- **Real-time Status Updates**: Get real-time feedback on printer status and job completion.

The `flutter_zebra_sdk` package simplifies the integration of Zebra devices into Flutter applications, making it an essential tool for developers working in industries that rely on mobile printing and scanning solutions.

# Setting Up the Flutter Zebra SDK

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_zebra_sdk` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_zebra_sdk` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_zebra_sdk: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_zebra_sdk).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

2. **Minimum SDK Version**: Ensure your `build.gradle` file has a minimum SDK version of at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open your `Info.plist` file and add the following keys for Bluetooth usage:

   ```xml
   <key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
   <string>This app requires Bluetooth access to connect to Zebra devices.</string>
   <key>NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription</key>
   <string>This app requires Bluetooth access to connect to Zebra devices.</string>
   ```

2. **Deployment Target**: Ensure your deployment target is set to at least iOS 10.0 in your `Podfile`:

   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to connect to a Zebra printer and print a test label.

# Complete Example of Using Flutter Zebra SDK

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_zebra_sdk/flutter_zebra_sdk.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Declare a printer instance
  ZebraPrinter? _printer;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the Zebra SDK
    ZebraSdk.initialize();
  }

  // Function to connect to the printer
  Future<void> _connectToPrinter() async {
    // List available printers
    List<ZebraPrinter> printers = await ZebraPrinter.listPrinters();
    if (printers.isNotEmpty) {
      // Connect to the first available printer
      _printer = printers.first;
      await _printer!.connect();
      print('Connected to ${_printer!.name}');
    } else {
      print('No printers found');
    }
  }

  // Function to print a test label
  Future<void> _printLabel() async {
    if (_printer != null) {
      // Create a label format
      String labelData = '^XA^FO50,50^ADN,36,20^FDHello, Zebra!^FS^XZ';
      await _printer!.printData(labelData);
      print('Label printed');
    } else {
      print('Printer not connected');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Zebra SDK Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _connectToPrinter,
                child: Text('Connect to Printer'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _printLabel,
                child: Text('Print Label'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the initState method, the Zebra SDK is initialized.
// 3. The user can connect to a printer by pressing the "Connect to Printer" button.
// 4. The app lists available printers and connects to the first one found.
// 5. Once connected, the user can print a test label by pressing the "Print Label" button.
// 6. The label is printed using the ZPL (Zebra Programming Language) format.
```
