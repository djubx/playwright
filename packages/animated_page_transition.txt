# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Animated Page Transition Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `animated_page_transition` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  animated_page_transition: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` in your terminal to install the package.

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart files where you want to use the package, import it as follows:

```dart
import 'package:animated_page_transition/animated_page_transition.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

### Basic Usage

To use the `animated_page_transition` package, you can wrap your navigation calls with the `AnimatedPageTransition` widget. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
Navigator.of(context).push(
  AnimatedPageTransition(
    page: NewPage(), // The new page you want to navigate to
    transitionType: TransitionType.fade, // Choose your transition type
  ),
);
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to support the animations properly:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

#### iOS

For iOS, make sure to enable the necessary permissions in your `Info.plist` if your animations require any specific configurations. Generally, the default settings should suffice for basic animations.

## Step 4: Optimizations

To ensure smooth animations, consider the following optimizations:

- Use `const` constructors where possible to reduce widget rebuilds.
- Profile your app using Flutter's performance tools to identify any bottlenecks during animations.

By following these steps, you can successfully integrate the `animated_page_transition` package into your Flutter application and start creating beautiful transitions.

# Complete Example of Using Animated Page Transition

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_page_transition/animated_page_transition.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animated Page Transition Example',
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Page'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate to the SecondPage with a fade transition
            Navigator.of(context).push(
              AnimatedPageTransition(
                page: SecondPage(),
                transitionType: TransitionType.fade,
              ),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Go to Second Page'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SecondPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Second Page'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate back to the HomePage with a slide transition
            Navigator.of(context).pop();
          },
          child: Text('Back to Home Page'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The HomePage is displayed first, featuring a button to navigate to the SecondPage.
// 3. When the button is pressed, the AnimatedPageTransition widget is used to push the SecondPage onto the navigation stack with a fade transition.
// 4. The SecondPage contains a button that, when pressed, pops the current page off the stack, returning to the HomePage.
// 5. The transitions between pages are smooth and visually appealing, enhancing the overall user experience.
