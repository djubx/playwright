# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Simple Downloader

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **simple_downloader** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **simple_downloader** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  simple_downloader: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the internet and write to external storage. Add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to add the following key to your `Info.plist` file to allow network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement file downloading using the **simple_downloader** package.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:simple_downloader/simple_downloader.dart';
```

2. Create an instance of the downloader and start a download:

```dart
final downloader = SimpleDownloader();
downloader.download(
  url: 'https://example.com/file.pdf',
  onProgress: (progress) {
    print('Download progress: $progress%');
  },
  onCompleted: (filePath) {
    print('File downloaded to: $filePath');
  },
  onError: (error) {
    print('Download error: $error');
  },
);
```

With these steps, you can easily set up and use the **simple_downloader** package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Simple Downloader

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simple_downloader/simple_downloader.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Simple Downloader Example',
      home: DownloaderScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class DownloaderScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DownloaderScreenState createState() => _DownloaderScreenState();
}

class _DownloaderScreenState extends State<DownloaderScreen> {
  final SimpleDownloader _downloader = SimpleDownloader();
  double _progress = 0.0; // Variable to track download progress

  void _startDownload() {
    // Start the download process
    _downloader.download(
      url: 'https://example.com/file.pdf', // URL of the file to download
      onProgress: (progress) {
        // Update the progress variable and refresh the UI
        setState(() {
          _progress = progress; // Update progress
        });
      },
      onCompleted: (filePath) {
        // Handle the completion of the download
        ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
          SnackBar(content: Text('File downloaded to: $filePath')),
        );
      },
      onError: (error) {
        // Handle any errors that occur during the download
        ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
          SnackBar(content: Text('Download error: $error')),
        );
      },
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Simple Downloader'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Download Progress: ${(_progress * 100).toStringAsFixed(0)}%'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _startDownload, // Start download on button press
              child: Text('Download File'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The DownloaderScreen widget is displayed, containing a button to start the download.
// 3. When the button is pressed, the _startDownload method is called.
// 4. The SimpleDownloader's download method is invoked with the file URL and callbacks for progress, completion, and error handling.
// 5. The progress is updated in the UI as the download progresses.
// 6. Upon completion, a SnackBar shows the file path, and in case of an error, an error message is displayed.
