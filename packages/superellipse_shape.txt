# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Superellipse Shape Package

## Installation
To use the `superellipse_shape` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  superellipse_shape: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
The `superellipse_shape` package is compatible with both Android and iOS platforms. There are no additional configurations required for either platform, making it easy to integrate into your existing Flutter project.

## Basic Usage
To use the `superellipse_shape` package, you can wrap your widgets with the `Superellipse` widget provided by the package. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:superellipse_shape/superellipse_shape.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Superellipse Shape Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Superellipse(
          borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(30), // Set the border radius
          child: Container(
            width: 200,
            height: 100,
            color: Colors.blue,
            child: Center(child: Text('Superellipse Shape', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white))),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple `Superellipse` widget that wraps a `Container`. The `borderRadius` property allows you to customize the shape's curvature.

# Complete Example of Using the Superellipse Shape Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:superellipse_shape/superellipse_shape.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Superellipse Shape Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Superellipse Shape Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Superellipse(
            borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(30), // Set the border radius for the superellipse shape
            child: Container(
              width: 200, // Width of the container
              height: 100, // Height of the container
              color: Colors.blue, // Background color of the container
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'Superellipse Shape', // Text displayed in the center
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white), // Text color
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to a Scaffold, which provides the basic structure.
// 4. An AppBar is created with the title 'Superellipse Shape Example'.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget to center its child.
// 6. Inside the Center, a Superellipse widget is created with a specified border radius.
// 7. The Superellipse wraps a Container that has a width of 200 and height of 100, with a blue background.
// 8. Finally, a Text widget is centered within the Container, displaying 'Superellipse Shape' in white color.
