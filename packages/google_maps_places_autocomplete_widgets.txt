# Tutorial: Setting Up Google Maps Places Autocomplete Widgets

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `google_maps_places_autocomplete_widgets` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependencies

First, you need to add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  google_maps_places_autocomplete_widgets: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/google_maps_places_autocomplete_widgets).

## Step 2: Configure API Keys

### For Android

1. Open the `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file.
2. Add your Google Maps API key inside the `<application>` tag:

```xml
<meta-data
    android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
    android:value="YOUR_API_KEY"/>
```

### For iOS

1. Open the `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift` file.
2. Add the following import statement at the top:

```swift
import GooglePlaces
```

3. In the `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method, add:

```swift
GMSPlacesClient.provideAPIKey("YOUR_API_KEY")
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the autocomplete widget.

# Complete Example: Implementing Google Maps Places Autocomplete

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:google_maps_places_autocomplete_widgets/google_maps_places_autocomplete_widgets.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Google Maps Places Autocomplete',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Places Autocomplete Example'),
        ),
        body: PlacesAutocompleteWidget(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class PlacesAutocompleteWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PlacesAutocompleteWidgetState createState() => _PlacesAutocompleteWidgetState();
}

class _PlacesAutocompleteWidgetState extends State<PlacesAutocompleteWidget> {
  // This variable will hold the selected place
  String? _selectedPlace;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
      child: Column(
        children: [
          // TextField for user input
          TextField(
            decoration: InputDecoration(
              labelText: 'Search for a place',
              border: OutlineInputBorder(),
            ),
            onChanged: (value) {
              // Trigger autocomplete suggestions based on user input
            },
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20),
          // Display the selected place
          Text(
            _selectedPlace != null ? 'Selected Place: $_selectedPlace' : 'No place selected',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home scaffold containing an AppBar and the PlacesAutocompleteWidget.
// 3. The PlacesAutocompleteWidget is a stateful widget that manages the state of the selected place.
// 4. Inside the widget, a TextField is provided for user input, where users can type to search for places.
// 5. As the user types, the app can trigger autocomplete suggestions (this part needs to be implemented).
// 6. The selected place is displayed below the TextField, updating dynamically as the user selects a place.
```

// Final Summary:
// The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` widget. This widget sets up a basic MaterialApp with an AppBar and a body containing the `PlacesAutocompleteWidget`. The `PlacesAutocompleteWidget` allows users to input text to search for places, and it displays the selected place below the input field. The autocomplete functionality can be implemented by listening to changes in the TextField and fetching suggestions from the Google Places API.
