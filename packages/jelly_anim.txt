# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Jelly Anim

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started with the **jelly_anim** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  jelly_anim: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:jelly_anim/jelly_anim.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using Jelly Anim
You can now use the jelly animations in your widgets. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a jelly button:

```dart
JellyAnim(
  child: ElevatedButton(
    onPressed: () {
      // Your action here
    },
    child: Text('Jelly Button'),
  ),
);
```

This wraps the button in a jelly animation, making it respond with a jelly-like effect when pressed.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the **jelly_anim** package into your Flutter application seamlessly.

# Complete Example of Jelly Anim in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:jelly_anim/jelly_anim.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Jelly Anim Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Jelly Animation Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: JellyAnim(
            // Wrapping the button with JellyAnim for animation effect
            child: ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action to perform on button press
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Jelly Button Pressed!')),
                );
              },
              child: Text('Press Me!'),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, we have a JellyAnim widget wrapping an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, it triggers a SnackBar to show a message.
// 6. The JellyAnim provides a jelly-like animation effect to the button when interacted with.
```
