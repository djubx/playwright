# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `fk_toggle`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `fk_toggle` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  fk_toggle: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the `fk_toggle` package:

```dart
import 'package:fk_toggle/fk_toggle.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Toggle in Your Widget

You can now use the `fk_toggle` widget in your Flutter application. Below is an example of how to implement it in a simple settings page.

### Platform-Specific Details

- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid compatibility issues.
  
  ```gradle
  android {
      ...
      defaultConfig {
          ...
          minSdkVersion 21
          ...
      }
  }
  ```

- **iOS**: No specific configurations are required for iOS, but ensure that your deployment target is set appropriately in `ios/Podfile`.

## Step 5: Customizing the Toggle

You can customize the toggle's appearance by passing various parameters to the `fk_toggle` widget. For example:

```dart
fk_toggle(
  value: isToggled,
  onChanged: (newValue) {
    setState(() {
      isToggled = newValue;
    });
  },
  activeColor: Colors.green,
  inactiveColor: Colors.red,
);
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to change the toggle's colors based on its state.

# Complete Example of `fk_toggle`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fk_toggle/fk_toggle.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // State variable to track the toggle state
  bool isToggled = false;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('fk_toggle Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Display the toggle switch
              fk_toggle(
                value: isToggled, // Current state of the toggle
                onChanged: (newValue) {
                  // Update the state when the toggle is changed
                  setState(() {
                    isToggled = newValue;
                  });
                },
                activeColor: Colors.green, // Color when active
                inactiveColor: Colors.red, // Color when inactive
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between toggle and text
              // Display the current state of the toggle
              Text(
                isToggled ? 'Toggle is ON' : 'Toggle is OFF',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the toggle.
// 3. The _RealFlutterState class contains a boolean variable 'isToggled' to track the toggle's state.
// 4. In the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the toggle and text vertically.
// 6. The fk_toggle widget is displayed, which takes the current state and a callback to update the state.
// 7. Below the toggle, a Text widget shows whether the toggle is ON or OFF based on the 'isToggled' state.
// 8. When the toggle is switched, the onChanged callback updates the state, causing the UI to rebuild and reflect the new state.
