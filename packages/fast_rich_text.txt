# Complete Example of Fast Rich Text

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fast_rich_text/fast_rich_text.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Fast Rich Text Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Fast Rich Text Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: RealFlutter(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return FastRichText(
      text: 'Hello, this is a sample text with ',
      textSpan: [
        TextSpan(
          text: 'bold',
          style: TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold, color: Colors.blue),
        ),
        TextSpan(
          text: ' and ',
        ),
        TextSpan(
          text: 'italic',
          style: TextStyle(fontStyle: FontStyle.italic, color: Colors.red),
        ),
        TextSpan(
          text: ' styles!',
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// The above code creates a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the fast_rich_text package.
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets up the MaterialApp widget.
// 2. MyApp is the main widget that contains the AppBar and the body.
// 3. In the body, we center the RealFlutter widget, which is where we use the FastRichText widget.
// 4. The FastRichText widget takes a base text and a list of TextSpan objects, allowing us to apply different styles to different parts of the text.
// 5. In this example, we have a base text "Hello, this is a sample text with " and then we apply bold and italic styles to specific words.
// 6. The result is a rich text display that showcases the capabilities of the fast_rich_text package.
