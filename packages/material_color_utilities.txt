2. Create a color palette based on a primary color:

```dart
void main() {
  Color primaryColor = Color(0xFF6200EE); // Purple 500
  ColorPalette palette = ColorPalette.fromPrimary(primaryColor);

# Complete Example of Using `material_color_utilities`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:material_color_utilities/material_color_utilities.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Define a primary color for the app
    Color primaryColor = Color(0xFF6200EE); // Purple 500
    // Generate a color palette from the primary color
    ColorPalette palette = ColorPalette.fromPrimary(primaryColor);

    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Material Color Utilities Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: palette.toMaterialColor(), // Convert palette to MaterialColor
      ),
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Material Color Utilities Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text(
                'Primary Color',
                style: TextStyle(color: palette.primary),
              ),
              Container(
                width: 100,
                height: 100,
                color: palette.light, // Use light shade from the palette
              ),
              Container(
                width: 100,
                height: 100,
                color: palette.dark, // Use dark shade from the palette
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds the MaterialApp, setting the title and theme.
// 3. A ColorPalette is created from a primary color (Purple 500).
// 4. The primary swatch for the theme is set using the generated palette.
// 5. The Scaffold widget provides the structure of the app, including an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 6. Inside the Center widget, a Column displays text and two containers with different shades from the color palette.
// 7. The light and dark shades are visually represented in the containers, demonstrating the use of the color palette.
