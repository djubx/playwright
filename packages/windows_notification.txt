# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Windows Notification Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `windows_notification` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  windows_notification: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Setup

### For Windows
1. **Enable Notifications**: Ensure that your Windows application has the necessary permissions to send notifications. This is typically handled in the app manifest.
2. **Configure the App Manifest**: Open the `Package.appxmanifest` file in your Windows project and ensure that the `Toast Notifications` capability is enabled.

### For iOS
While this package is primarily for Windows, if you plan to use similar notification features on iOS, consider using the `flutter_local_notifications` package for cross-platform support.

## Step 3: Basic Usage
Hereâ€™s how to use the `windows_notification` package in your Flutter application:

1. **Import the Package**:
   ```dart
   import 'package:windows_notification/windows_notification.dart';
   ```

2. **Initialize Notifications**:
   You can initialize notifications in your main application file or wherever appropriate.

3. **Send a Notification**:
   Use the following code snippet to send a notification:

   ```dart
   void sendNotification() {
     final notification = WindowsNotification(
       title: 'Hello, Flutter!',
       body: 'This is a notification from your Flutter app.',
       icon: 'assets/icon.png', // Path to your icon
     );

     notification.show();
   }
   ```

## Step 4: Testing
Run your application on a Windows machine to test the notification functionality. Ensure that your app is allowed to send notifications in the Windows settings.

By following these steps, you can successfully integrate and utilize the `windows_notification` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using the Windows Notification Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:windows_notification/windows_notification.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Windows Notification Example',
      home: NotificationHome(),
    );
  }
}

class NotificationHome extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Windows Notification Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Call the function to send a notification when the button is pressed
            sendNotification();
          },
          child: Text('Send Notification'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void sendNotification() {
    // Create a new notification instance
    final notification = WindowsNotification(
      title: 'Hello, Flutter!',
      body: 'This is a notification from your Flutter app.',
      icon: 'assets/icon.png', // Path to your icon
    );

    // Show the notification
    notification.show();
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app and sets MyApp as the home widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget NotificationHome.
// 3. NotificationHome contains a button that, when pressed, triggers the sendNotification function.
// 4. The sendNotification function creates a WindowsNotification instance with a title, body, and icon.
// 5. Finally, the notification is displayed to the user, providing an interactive experience.
