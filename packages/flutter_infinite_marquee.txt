```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_infinite_marquee/flutter_infinite_marquee.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Infinite Marquee Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Infinite Marquee Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Marquee(
          // This is the text that will be scrolling
          text: 'This is a scrolling text that will scroll infinitely',
          // This is the speed of the scrolling text
          speed: 10.0,
          // This is the text style of the scrolling text
          textStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 24.0),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and the `MyApp` widget is created.
// 2. The `MyApp` widget builds the `MaterialApp` widget with the `RealFlutter` widget as the home screen.
// 3. The `RealFlutter` widget builds the `Scaffold` widget with the `AppBar` and the `Marquee` widget.
// 4. The `Marquee` widget is created with the scrolling text, speed, and text style.
// 5. The `Marquee` widget starts scrolling the text infinitely.
// 6. The user can adjust the speed and text style of the scrolling text by modifying the `speed` and `textStyle` properties of the `Marquee` widget.

// In summary, this code creates a simple Flutter app that demonstrates the use of the `flutter_infinite_marquee` package to create a scrolling marquee with infinite scrolling.
