# Setting Up and Using SoundCloud Explode Dart

## Installation
To get started with the `soundcloud_explode_dart` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  soundcloud_explode_dart: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/soundcloud_explode_dart).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following permissions to allow network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:soundcloud_explode_dart/soundcloud_explode_dart.dart';
```

You can then create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class to start fetching data from SoundCloud.

```dart
class RealFlutter {
  final SoundCloud soundCloud;

  RealFlutter() : soundCloud = SoundCloud();

  Future<void> fetchTrack(String trackUrl) async {
    var track = await soundCloud.getTrack(trackUrl);
    print('Track Title: ${track.title}');
  }
}
```

This basic setup allows you to fetch a track by its URL. You can expand this functionality to include playlists and user profiles as needed.

# Complete Example of Using SoundCloud Explode Dart

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:soundcloud_explode_dart/soundcloud_explode_dart.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'SoundCloud Explode Dart Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: SoundCloudHome(),
    );
  }
}

class SoundCloudHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SoundCloudHomeState createState() => _SoundCloudHomeState();
}

class _SoundCloudHomeState extends State<SoundCloudHome> {
  final SoundCloud soundCloud = SoundCloud();
  Track? track;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    fetchTrack();
  }

  // Fetch a track from SoundCloud using its URL
  Future<void> fetchTrack() async {
    // Replace with a valid SoundCloud track URL
    String trackUrl = 'https://soundcloud.com/artist/track';
    track = await soundCloud.getTrack(trackUrl);
    setState(() {}); // Update the UI after fetching the track
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('SoundCloud Track'),
      ),
      body: track == null
          ? Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator()) // Show loading indicator
          : Column(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              children: [
                Text('Track Title: ${track!.title}'), // Display track title
                Text('Artist: ${track!.user.username}'), // Display artist name
                // Add more track details as needed
              ],
            ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home as SoundCloudHome.
// 3. In SoundCloudHome, we initialize the SoundCloud instance and fetch a track in initState.
// 4. The fetchTrack method retrieves a track using its URL and updates the state.
// 5. The UI displays a loading indicator while the track is being fetched.
// 6. Once the track is fetched, its title and artist are displayed on the screen.
