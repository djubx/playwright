# Tutorial: Setting Up Easy Load More

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **easy_load_more** package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the **easy_load_more** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  easy_load_more: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # Ensure this is set to at least 10.0
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that we have the package set up, let's implement it in our Flutter application.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:easy_load_more/easy_load_more.dart';
```

2. Create a stateful widget that will use the `LoadMore` widget to display a list of items.

3. Implement the logic to fetch more data when the user scrolls to the bottom of the list.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the **easy_load_more** package in your Flutter app.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:easy_load_more/easy_load_more.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Easy Load More Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // List to hold the items
  List<String> items = [];
  // Controller for the LoadMore widget
  final LoadMoreController _controller = LoadMoreController();
  // Current page number
  int page = 0;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Load initial data
    loadData();
  }

  // Function to load data
  Future<void> loadData() async {
    // Simulate a network call
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));
    // Generate new items
    List<String> newItems = List.generate(10, (index) => 'Item ${page * 10 + index + 1}');
    // Update the items list
    setState(() {
      items.addAll(newItems);
      page++;
    });
    // Notify the controller that loading is complete
    _controller.loadComplete();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Easy Load More Example'),
      ),
      body: LoadMore(
        controller: _controller,
        onLoadMore: loadData, // Load more data when needed
        child: ListView.builder(
          itemCount: items.length,
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            return ListTile(
              title: Text(items[index]),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which is a stateful widget.
// 3. In the initState method, loadData is called to fetch the initial set of items.
// 4. The loadData function simulates a network call and generates a list of items.
// 5. The items are added to the state, and the LoadMoreController is notified that loading is complete.
// 6. The ListView.builder displays the items, and when the user scrolls to the bottom, loadData is called again to fetch more items.
```

// The application flow is as follows:
// - The app initializes and displays the main screen with a list of items.
// - When the user scrolls to the bottom of the list, the `loadData` function is triggered to fetch more items.
// - The new items are appended to the existing list, and the UI updates automatically.
// - This process continues as the user scrolls, providing a smooth infinite scrolling experience.
