# Complete Example of Using Gallery Image Viewer

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gallery_image_viewer/gallery_image_viewer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Gallery Image Viewer Example',
      home: GalleryScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class GalleryScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  // Sample list of image URLs
  final List<String> imageUrls = [
    'https://example.com/image1.jpg',
    'https://example.com/image2.jpg',
    'https://example.com/image3.jpg',
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Gallery Image Viewer'),
      ),
      body: GridView.builder(
        gridDelegate: SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount(
          crossAxisCount: 2, // Number of columns in the grid
        ),
        itemCount: imageUrls.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return GestureDetector(
            onTap: () {
              // On tapping an image, navigate to the gallery viewer
              Navigator.push(
                context,
                MaterialPageRoute(
                  builder: (context) => ImageViewerScreen(imageUrls, index),
                ),
              );
            },
            child: Image.network(
              imageUrls[index],
              fit: BoxFit.cover, // Fit the image within the grid cell
            ),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

class ImageViewerScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final List<String> imageUrls;
  final int initialIndex;

  ImageViewerScreen(this.imageUrls, this.initialIndex);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: GalleryImageViewer(
        images: imageUrls, // List of images to display
        initialIndex: initialIndex, // Starting index for the viewer
        onBack: () {
          // Action to perform on back button press
          Navigator.pop(context);
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (GalleryScreen).
// 3. GalleryScreen displays a grid of images using GridView.builder.
// 4. Each image is wrapped in a GestureDetector to handle taps.
// 5. On tapping an image, it navigates to ImageViewerScreen, passing the list of image URLs and the index of the tapped image.
// 6. ImageViewerScreen uses GalleryImageViewer to display the images, allowing users to swipe and zoom.
// 7. The onBack callback allows users to return to the previous screen when they are done viewing images.
