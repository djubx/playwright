# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Dart Numerics

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `dart_numerics` package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dart_numerics: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter and Dart. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the package to start using its features:

```dart
import 'package:dart_numerics/dart_numerics.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package

You can now use the features of the `dart_numerics` package in your Flutter application. For example, you can perform matrix operations or statistical calculations as shown in the complete example below.

# Complete Example of Using Dart Numerics

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dart_numerics/dart_numerics.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dart Numerics Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Dart Numerics Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: NumericalOperations(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class NumericalOperations extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a 2x2 matrix
    Matrix matrixA = Matrix([[1, 2], [3, 4]]);
    Matrix matrixB = Matrix([[5, 6], [7, 8]]);

    // Perform matrix addition
    Matrix resultAdd = matrixA + matrixB;

    // Perform matrix multiplication
    Matrix resultMultiply = matrixA * matrixB;

    // Calculate the mean of a list of numbers
    List<double> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    double mean = Statistics.mean(numbers);

    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Text('Matrix A: $matrixA'),
        Text('Matrix B: $matrixB'),
        Text('Matrix A + Matrix B: $resultAdd'),
        Text('Matrix A * Matrix B: $resultMultiply'),
        Text('Mean of numbers: $mean'),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the Flutter application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds the MaterialApp, setting the title and home widget.
// 3. The NumericalOperations widget is created, which performs various numerical operations.
// 4. Inside NumericalOperations, two matrices are created and added together, and multiplied.
// 5. The mean of a list of numbers is calculated using the Statistics class from the dart_numerics package.
// 6. The results of the operations are displayed in a column of text widgets in the center of the screen.
```
