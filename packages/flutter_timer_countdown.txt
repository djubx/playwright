# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_timer_countdown

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_timer_countdown` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_timer_countdown: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a countdown timer.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_timer_countdown/flutter_timer_countdown.dart';
```

2. Create a StatefulWidget to manage the timer state:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Countdown Timer Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: TimerCountdown(
          format: CountDownTimerFormat.hoursMinutesSeconds,
          endTime: DateTime.now().add(Duration(hours: 1)), // Set the countdown duration
          onEnd: () {
            // Action to perform when the timer ends
            print('Timer ended!');
          },
          onTick: (remaining) {
            // Action to perform on each tick
            print('Time remaining: $remaining');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Run your application to see the countdown timer in action.

# Complete Example of flutter_timer_countdown

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_timer_countdown/flutter_timer_countdown.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Timer Countdown',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Countdown Timer Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: TimerCountdown(
          format: CountDownTimerFormat.hoursMinutesSeconds, // Set the format for the countdown
          endTime: DateTime.now().add(Duration(hours: 1)), // Set the countdown duration to 1 hour
          onEnd: () {
            // This callback is triggered when the countdown ends
            print('Timer ended!'); // Log message when timer ends
            // You can also show a dialog or navigate to another screen here
          },
          onTick: (remaining) {
            // This callback is triggered on each tick of the countdown
            print('Time remaining: $remaining'); // Log the remaining time
            // You can update the UI or perform other actions here
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home screen as RealFlutter.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that builds the UI with a TimerCountdown widget.
// 4. The TimerCountdown widget is configured to count down from 1 hour.
// 5. The onEnd callback is triggered when the countdown reaches zero, logging a message.
// 6. The onTick callback is triggered every second, logging the remaining time.
// 7. The app displays the countdown timer in the center of the screen.
```
