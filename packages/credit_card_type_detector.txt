# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Credit Card Type Detector

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `credit_card_type_detector` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `credit_card_type_detector` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  credit_card_type_detector: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/credit_card_type_detector).

## Step 2: Install Packages

Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` file to include any necessary permissions, although this package does not require special permissions for basic functionality.

## Step 4: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:credit_card_type_detector/credit_card_type_detector.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package

You can now use the package to detect credit card types. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it in your application.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:credit_card_type_detector/credit_card_type_detector.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Credit Card Type Detector',
      home: CreditCardForm(),
    );
  }
}

class CreditCardForm extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CreditCardFormState createState() => _CreditCardFormState();
}

class _CreditCardFormState extends State<CreditCardForm> {
  final TextEditingController _cardNumberController = TextEditingController();
  String _cardType = '';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Credit Card Type Detector'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              controller: _cardNumberController,
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Enter Card Number',
                hintText: 'e.g. 4111 1111 1111 1111',
              ),
              keyboardType: TextInputType.number,
              onChanged: (value) {
                // Detect the card type whenever the input changes
                setState(() {
                  _cardType = detectCardType(value);
                });
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(
              'Detected Card Type: $_cardType',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  String detectCardType(String cardNumber) {
    // Use the credit_card_type_detector package to get the card type
    final cardType = detectCCType(cardNumber);
    return cardType.toString().split('.').last; // Get the card type name
  }
}
```

```dart
// The above code defines a simple Flutter application that detects the type of credit card based on user input.
// 
// 1. **Main Function**: The entry point of the application, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. **MyApp Widget**: A StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp and the home screen.
// 3. **CreditCardForm Widget**: A StatefulWidget that contains the form for entering the credit card number.
// 4. **TextEditingController**: Used to control the input field for the card number.
// 5. **TextField**: A text input field where users can enter their credit card number. The onChanged callback is used to detect the card type whenever the input changes.
// 6. **detectCardType Method**: This method uses the `credit_card_type_detector` package to determine the card type based on the input number.
// 7. **Displaying Card Type**: The detected card type is displayed below the input field, updating in real-time as the user types.
// 
// Overall, this application provides a user-friendly interface for detecting credit card types, enhancing the payment experience.
