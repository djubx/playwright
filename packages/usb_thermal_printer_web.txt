# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using usb_thermal_printer_web

## Installation
To get started with the `usb_thermal_printer_web` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  usb_thermal_printer_web: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/usb_thermal_printer_web).

## Platform-Specific Details
### Web Configuration
- Ensure that your web application has the necessary permissions to access USB devices. This typically involves configuring your web server to allow USB access.
- You may need to handle user permissions for USB access in your application.

### Example Usage
Hereâ€™s how to use the package in your Flutter web application:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:
   ```dart
   import 'package:usb_thermal_printer_web/usb_thermal_printer_web.dart';
   ```

2. Initialize the printer and set up the print job:
   ```dart
   void printReceipt() async {
     // Create an instance of the printer
     final printer = UsbThermalPrinter();

     // Request access to the printer
     await printer.connect();

     // Print a sample receipt
     await printer.printText("Hello, World!", styles: PosStyles(align: PosAlign.center));
     await printer.printNewLine();
     await printer.printText("Thank you for your purchase!", styles: PosStyles(align: PosAlign.center));
     
     // Disconnect from the printer
     await printer.disconnect();
   }
   ```

3. Call the `printReceipt` function when you want to print.

This setup allows you to print text directly to a connected USB thermal printer from your Flutter web application.

# Complete Example of Using usb_thermal_printer_web

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:usb_thermal_printer_web/usb_thermal_printer_web.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'USB Thermal Printer Example',
      home: PrinterHome(),
    );
  }
}

class PrinterHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PrinterHomeState createState() => _PrinterHomeState();
}

class _PrinterHomeState extends State<PrinterHome> {
  final UsbThermalPrinter printer = UsbThermalPrinter();

  // Function to print a receipt
  void printReceipt() async {
    // Request access to the printer
    await printer.connect();

    // Print a sample receipt
    await printer.printText("Hello, World!", styles: PosStyles(align: PosAlign.center));
    await printer.printNewLine();
    await printer.printText("Thank you for your purchase!", styles: PosStyles(align: PosAlign.center));
    
    // Disconnect from the printer
    await printer.disconnect();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('USB Thermal Printer Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: printReceipt, // Call the print function on button press
          child: Text('Print Receipt'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```
// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app and sets MyApp as the home widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets PrinterHome as the home screen.
// 3. PrinterHome is a StatefulWidget that manages the state of the printing process.
// 4. The printReceipt function is defined to handle the printing logic:
//    - It connects to the USB printer.
//    - It sends text to the printer, formatted with styles.
//    - Finally, it disconnects from the printer.
// 5. The UI consists of a button that, when pressed, triggers the printReceipt function, allowing users to print a receipt.
