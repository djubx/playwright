# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the otp_timer_button Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `otp_timer_button` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  otp_timer_button: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the OTP timer button, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:otp_timer_button/otp_timer_button.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Widget

You can now use the `OtpTimerButton` widget in your application. Below is an example of how to implement it in a simple Flutter app.

### Platform-Specific Details

- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid compatibility issues.
  
  ```gradle
  android {
      ...
      defaultConfig {
          ...
          minSdkVersion 21
          ...
      }
  }
  ```

- **iOS**: No specific configurations are required for iOS, but ensure that your deployment target is set appropriately in `ios/Podfile`.

## Step 4: Customizing the Button

You can customize the button's appearance and behavior using various properties such as `onPressed`, `duration`, and `textStyle`. 

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set up the button:

```dart
OtpTimerButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // Action to perform when the button is pressed
    print("OTP sent!");
  },
  duration: 30, // Duration in seconds
  textStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 16),
  buttonStyle: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(primary: Colors.blue),
)
```

This setup will create a button that, when pressed, will start a 30-second countdown.

# Complete Example of Using otp_timer_button

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:otp_timer_button/otp_timer_button.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'OTP Timer Button Example',
      home: OTPVerificationScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class OTPVerificationScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _OTPVerificationScreenState createState() => _OTPVerificationScreenState();
}

class _OTPVerificationScreenState extends State<OTPVerificationScreen> {
  // State variable to manage OTP input
  String otp = '';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('OTP Verification'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // TextField for OTP input
            Padding(
              padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
              child: TextField(
                onChanged: (value) {
                  otp = value; // Update OTP state on input change
                },
                decoration: InputDecoration(
                  border: OutlineInputBorder(),
                  labelText: 'Enter OTP',
                ),
                keyboardType: TextInputType.number,
              ),
            ),
            // OTP Timer Button
            OtpTimerButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action to perform when the button is pressed
                print("OTP sent!"); // Simulate sending OTP
              },
              duration: 30, // Duration in seconds
              textStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 16),
              buttonStyle: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(primary: Colors.blue),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to verify OTP
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Logic to verify the entered OTP
                if (otp == '123456') { // Simulated OTP check
                  print("OTP verified successfully!");
                } else {
                  print("Invalid OTP. Please try again.");
                }
              },
              child: Text('Verify OTP'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The OTPVerificationScreen is displayed, containing a TextField for OTP input.
// 3. The OtpTimerButton is displayed, which starts a countdown when pressed.
// 4. The user can enter the OTP and press the 'Verify OTP' button to check if the entered OTP is correct.
// 5. If the OTP matches the simulated value ('123456'), a success message is printed; otherwise, an error message is shown.
