The code flows as follows:

1. The user presses the "Show Overlay" button.
2. The `onPressed` callback is called, creating an instance of the `Overlay` class.
3. The `Overlay` instance is passed to the `OverlayKit.showOverlay` method, which displays the overlay on top of the main application UI.
4. The overlay is displayed until the user interacts with it or it is programmatically dismissed.
