### Tutorial

To get started with the `overlay_kit` package, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the `overlay_kit` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  overlay_kit: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/overlay_kit).

#### Step 2: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:overlay_kit/overlay_kit.dart';
```

#### Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

For both Android and iOS, no additional configurations are typically required for basic usage. However, ensure that your app has the necessary permissions if you plan to use overlays that require user interaction.

#### Step 4: Basic Usage

You can create an overlay by using the `OverlayKit` class. Here’s a simple example of how to display an overlay:

```dart
OverlayKit.showOverlay(
  context: context,
  builder: (context) => Positioned(
    top: 100,
    left: 50,
    child: Material(
      elevation: 4.0,
      child: Container(
        padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
        child: Text('Hello, Overlay!'),
      ),
    ),
  ),
);
```

This code snippet shows how to create a simple overlay positioned at the top left of the screen.

### Complete Example

Here’s a complete Flutter application demonstrating the use of the `overlay_kit` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:overlay_kit/overlay_kit.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Overlay Kit Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Overlay Kit Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Show overlay when button is pressed
              OverlayKit.showOverlay(
                context: context,
                builder: (context) => Positioned(
                  top: 100,
                  left: 50,
                  child: Material(
                    elevation: 4.0,
                    child: Container(
                      padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
                      child: Text('Hello, Overlay!'),
                    ),
                  ),
                ),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Show Overlay'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, there's an AppBar and a Center widget containing an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the onPressed callback is triggered.
// 5. The OverlayKit.showOverlay method is called, which displays an overlay at the specified position.
// 6. The overlay contains a Material widget with a Container that holds a Text widget saying "Hello, Overlay!".
// 7. The overlay will remain visible until dismissed or removed programmatically.
```
