# Overview of the `stats` Flutter Package

The `stats` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to simplify statistical calculations and data analysis within Flutter applications. It provides a comprehensive set of functions and utilities that allow developers to perform complex statistical operations with ease. This package is particularly useful in applications that require data analysis, such as finance, health, and scientific research apps.

## When to Use the `stats` Package

- **Data Analysis**: When your application needs to perform statistical analysis on datasets.
- **Real-time Calculations**: For apps that require real-time statistical computations, such as monitoring apps.
- **Educational Tools**: In educational apps that teach statistics or data science concepts.

## Key Features

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculate mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation.
- **Probability Distributions**: Work with various probability distributions like normal, binomial, and Poisson.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Perform t-tests, chi-square tests, and more.
- **Regression Analysis**: Conduct linear and multiple regression analysis.

The `stats` package is designed to be intuitive and easy to integrate, making it a go-to choice for developers looking to add statistical capabilities to their Flutter applications.

# Setting Up and Using the `stats` Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up the `stats` package in a Flutter project and demonstrate how to use its features effectively.

## Setup Process

1. **Add Dependency**: First, add the `stats` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     stats: ^1.0.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run the following command to install the new package.

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Import the Package**: Import the `stats` package in your Dart file where you intend to use it.

   ```dart
   import 'package:stats/stats.dart';
   ```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

- Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to support all features of the `stats` package.

  ```gradle
  android {
      defaultConfig {
          minSdkVersion 21
      }
  }
  ```

### iOS

- No specific configurations are required for iOS, but ensure your deployment target is set to iOS 10.0 or higher in your `ios/Podfile`.

  ```ruby
  platform :ios, '10.0'
  ```

## Using the Package

To use the `stats` package, create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class and call the desired statistical methods. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
void main() {
  final stats = RealFlutter([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
  print('Mean: ${stats.mean()}');
  print('Variance: ${stats.variance()}');
}
```

This example demonstrates how to calculate the mean and variance of a dataset using the `RealFlutter` class.

# Complete Example of Using the `stats` Package

Below is a complete Flutter application that demonstrates the key features of the `stats` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:stats/stats.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// Main application widget
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Stats Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: StatsDemoPage(),
    );
  }
}

// Home page of the application
class StatsDemoPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _StatsDemoPageState createState() => _StatsDemoPageState();
}

class _StatsDemoPageState extends State<StatsDemoPage> {
  final List<double> data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
  late RealFlutter stats;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the RealFlutter instance with data
    stats = RealFlutter(data);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Stats Package Demo'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Data: $data'),
            SizedBox(height: 10),
            Text('Mean: ${stats.mean()}'),
            Text('Median: ${stats.median()}'),
            Text('Variance: ${stats.variance()}'),
            Text('Standard Deviation: ${stats.standardDeviation()}'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// Explanation of the Application Flow
// 1. The `main` function initializes the Flutter app by running `MyApp`.
// 2. `MyApp` is a stateless widget that sets up the MaterialApp with a home page `StatsDemoPage`.
// 3. `StatsDemoPage` is a stateful widget that initializes a `RealFlutter` instance with a list of data in `initState`.
// 4. The `build` method of `_StatsDemoPageState` constructs the UI, displaying the data and calculated statistics.
// 5. The statistics displayed include mean, median, variance, and standard deviation, calculated using the `RealFlutter` instance.
