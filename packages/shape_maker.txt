# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `shape_maker`

## Installation
To get started with the `shape_maker` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  shape_maker: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package. After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
Once you have installed the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a custom shape using `shape_maker`.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:shape_maker/shape_maker.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Shape Maker Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ShapeMaker(
          shape: Shape.circle,
          size: 100,
          color: Colors.blue,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple circular shape in the center of the screen. You can customize the shape, size, and color as needed.

# Complete Example of `shape_maker`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:shape_maker/shape_maker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Shape Maker Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Shape Maker Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Creating a circular shape
              ShapeMaker(
                shape: Shape.circle,
                size: 100,
                color: Colors.blue,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between shapes
              // Creating a rectangular shape
              ShapeMaker(
                shape: Shape.rectangle,
                size: 100,
                color: Colors.red,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between shapes
              // Creating a triangle shape
              ShapeMaker(
                shape: Shape.triangle,
                size: 100,
                color: Colors.green,
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to a Scaffold widget.
// 4. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Shape Maker Example'.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold is centered using a Center widget.
// 6. Inside the Center widget, a Column widget is used to arrange shapes vertically.
// 7. Three ShapeMaker widgets are created for different shapes: circle, rectangle, and triangle.
// 8. Each shape has a specified size and color, and SizedBox is used to add space between them.
// 9. The app displays the shapes in the center of the screen, showcasing the capabilities of the shape_maker package.
