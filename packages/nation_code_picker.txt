# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using nation_code_picker

## Installation
To get started with the `nation_code_picker`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  nation_code_picker: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/nation_code_picker).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` file to include permissions for network access if your app requires it. However, the `nation_code_picker` does not require any specific permissions.

## Using the Package
To use the `nation_code_picker`, you can follow these steps in your Flutter widget:

1. Import the package:
   ```dart
   import 'package:nation_code_picker/nation_code_picker.dart';
   ```

2. Create a widget that utilizes the `NationCodePicker`:
   ```dart
   NationCodePicker(
     onChanged: (countryCode) {
       // Handle the selected country code
       print("Selected country code: ${countryCode.dialCode}");
     },
   )
   ```

3. You can customize the appearance and behavior of the picker as needed.

This setup will allow you to integrate the country code picker into your Flutter application seamlessly.

# Complete Example of nation_code_picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:nation_code_picker/nation_code_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Nation Code Picker Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Nation Code Picker Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: CountryCodePickerWidget(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class CountryCodePickerWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CountryCodePickerWidgetState createState() => _CountryCodePickerWidgetState();
}

class _CountryCodePickerWidgetState extends State<CountryCodePickerWidget> {
  String _selectedCode = '';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        // Display the selected country code
        Text(
          'Selected Country Code: $_selectedCode',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20),
        // NationCodePicker widget for selecting country code
        NationCodePicker(
          onChanged: (countryCode) {
            // Update the selected country code when the user selects one
            setState(() {
              _selectedCode = countryCode.dialCode; // Store the selected dial code
            });
          },
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds the CountryCodePickerWidget.
// 4. The CountryCodePickerWidget is a StatefulWidget that maintains the selected country code.
// 5. Inside the build method, it displays the currently selected country code and includes the NationCodePicker.
// 6. When a user selects a country code, the onChanged callback updates the state with the new dial code.
// 7. The UI reflects the selected country code dynamically as the user interacts with the picker.
