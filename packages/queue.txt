# Understanding the `queue` Flutter Package

The `queue` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to manage task execution in a sequential manner. It is particularly useful in scenarios where tasks need to be processed one at a time, ensuring that each task is completed before the next one begins. This package is ideal for managing network requests, file operations, or any other asynchronous tasks that require orderly execution.

## When to Use the `queue` Package

- **Network Requests**: When you have multiple network requests that need to be executed in a specific order.
- **File Operations**: When performing read/write operations on files where order and completion are crucial.
- **Task Management**: In applications where tasks need to be queued and processed sequentially to avoid race conditions.

## Key Features

- **Task Sequencing**: Ensures tasks are executed in the order they are added.
- **Concurrency Control**: Limits the number of tasks that can run simultaneously.
- **Error Handling**: Provides mechanisms to handle errors in task execution gracefully.
- **Task Prioritization**: Allows prioritization of tasks within the queue.

# Setting Up and Using the `queue` Package in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup and usage of the `queue` package in a Flutter application. We will cover platform-specific configurations for both Android and iOS.

## Setup Process

1. **Add Dependency**: First, add the `queue` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     queue: ^1.0.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run `flutter pub get` to install the new package.

3. **Platform-Specific Configurations**:
   - **Android**: Ensure your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21.
   - **iOS**: No specific configurations are required, but ensure your deployment target is set to iOS 9.0 or higher.

## Using the `queue` Package

To use the `queue` package, you need to create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class, which will manage your task queue. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to set it up:

```dart
import 'package:queue/queue.dart';

class RealFlutter {
  final Queue _queue = Queue();

  void addTask(Function task) {
    _queue.add(() async {
      await task();
    });
  }
}
```

- **Creating a Queue**: Instantiate the `Queue` class.
- **Adding Tasks**: Use the `addTask` method to add tasks to the queue. Each task is a function that returns a `Future`.

# Complete Example: Using the `queue` Package in a Flutter App

Below is a complete example of a Flutter application using the `queue` package to manage task execution.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:queue/queue.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Queue Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: TaskQueueScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class TaskQueueScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _TaskQueueScreenState createState() => _TaskQueueScreenState();
}

class _TaskQueueScreenState extends State<TaskQueueScreen> {
  final RealFlutter _realFlutter = RealFlutter();
  String _status = 'Idle';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Queue Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Task Status: $_status',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _startTasks,
              child: Text('Start Tasks'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void _startTasks() {
    setState(() {
      _status = 'Running';
    });

    // Add tasks to the queue
    _realFlutter.addTask(() async {
      await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));
      setState(() {
        _status = 'Task 1 Completed';
      });
    });

    _realFlutter.addTask(() async {
      await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));
      setState(() {
        _status = 'Task 2 Completed';
      });
    });

    _realFlutter.addTask(() async {
      await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));
      setState(() {
        _status = 'All Tasks Completed';
      });
    });
  }
}

class RealFlutter {
  final Queue _queue = Queue();

  void addTask(Function task) {
    _queue.add(() async {
      await task();
    });
  }
}
```

// The application starts by running the `MyApp` widget.
// `MyApp` sets up a basic Material app with a home screen `TaskQueueScreen`.
// `TaskQueueScreen` is a stateful widget that manages the task queue using the `RealFlutter` class.
// The `_startTasks` method adds three tasks to the queue, each simulating a delay to mimic task execution.
// As each task completes, the UI updates to reflect the current status of the task execution.
// The `RealFlutter` class encapsulates the `Queue` and provides a method to add tasks to it.
