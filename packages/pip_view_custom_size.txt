# Overview of the `pip_view_custom_size` Flutter Package

The `pip_view_custom_size` package is a versatile Flutter library designed to create customizable Picture-in-Picture (PiP) views. This package is particularly useful for applications that require video playback or any content that benefits from a floating window experience. With `pip_view_custom_size`, developers can easily implement PiP functionality, allowing users to interact with other app features while keeping the video or content in view.

## When to Use This Package
- **Video Streaming Apps**: Ideal for apps that stream video content, allowing users to watch while browsing.
- **Educational Apps**: Useful for tutorials or courses where video content is essential.
- **Multimedia Applications**: Any app that requires simultaneous interaction with video and other UI elements.

## Key Features
- **Customizable Size**: Adjust the size of the PiP window to fit your app's design.
- **Drag and Drop**: Users can move the PiP window around the screen.
- **Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Lifecycle Management**: Automatically handles the PiP lifecycle, ensuring a smooth user experience.

# Setting Up and Using `pip_view_custom_size`

## Installation
To add the `pip_view_custom_size` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  pip_view_custom_size: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/pip_view_custom_size).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW"/>
```

3. Ensure your app's minimum SDK version is set to at least 21 (Lollipop) in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to request permission for PiP:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the microphone for video calls.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `pip_view_custom_size` package, you can create a simple widget that initializes the PiP view. Below is a basic example of how to implement it in your Flutter application.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pip_view_custom_size/pip_view_custom_size.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Initialize the PiP controller
  late PipViewController _pipController;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _pipController = PipViewController();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('PiP View Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Start the PiP view
            _pipController.startPiP();
          },
          child: Text('Open PiP View'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple button that, when pressed, opens the PiP view.

# Complete Example of `pip_view_custom_size`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pip_view_custom_size/pip_view_custom_size.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Create a controller for the PiP view
  late PipViewController _pipController;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the PiP controller
    _pipController = PipViewController();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('PiP View Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Start the PiP view when the button is pressed
            _pipController.startPiP();
          },
          child: Text('Open PiP View'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The _RealFlutterState is created, initializing the PipViewController.
// 3. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is displayed.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the startPiP method of the PipViewController is called,
//    which opens the Picture-in-Picture view, allowing users to interact with the app while watching content.
```
