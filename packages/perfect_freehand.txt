# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Perfect Freehand Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the **perfect_freehand** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  perfect_freehand: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you plan to use features that require user permissions (like accessing the camera or storage).

## Step 4: Basic Usage
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a drawing canvas using the **perfect_freehand** package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:perfect_freehand/perfect_freehand.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  List<Offset?> points = [];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Perfect Freehand Example'),
      ),
      body: GestureDetector(
        onPanUpdate: (details) {
          setState(() {
            RenderBox renderBox = context.findRenderObject() as RenderBox;
            points.add(renderBox.globalToLocal(details.globalPosition));
          });
        },
        onPanEnd: (details) {
          points.add(null); // Add a null point to indicate the end of a stroke
        },
        child: CustomPaint(
          painter: FreehandPainter(points),
          child: Container(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class FreehandPainter extends CustomPainter {
  final List<Offset?> points;

  FreehandPainter(this.points);

  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    Paint paint = Paint()
      ..color = Colors.black
      ..strokeCap = StrokeCap.round
      ..strokeWidth = 5.0;

    for (int i = 0; i < points.length - 1; i++) {
      if (points[i] != null && points[i + 1] != null) {
        canvas.drawLine(points[i]!, points[i + 1]!, paint);
      }
    }
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(covariant CustomPainter oldDelegate) {
    return true;
  }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code
- **GestureDetector**: This widget detects gestures, allowing users to draw on the screen.
- **onPanUpdate**: This callback is triggered when the user drags their finger on the screen. It captures the position and adds it to the `points` list.
- **CustomPaint**: This widget is used to create a custom drawing area. The `FreehandPainter` class is responsible for rendering the lines based on the points collected.

With these steps, you can easily set up and start using the **perfect_freehand** package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using the Perfect Freehand Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:perfect_freehand/perfect_freehand.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Perfect Freehand Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // List to hold the points drawn by the user
  List<Offset?> points = [];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Perfect Freehand Example'),
      ),
      body: GestureDetector(
        // Detects the user's finger movement
        onPanUpdate: (details) {
          setState(() {
            // Get the position of the user's finger
            RenderBox renderBox = context.findRenderObject() as RenderBox;
            points.add(renderBox.globalToLocal(details.globalPosition));
          });
        },
        // Indicates the end of a stroke
        onPanEnd: (details) {
          points.add(null); // Add a null point to indicate the end of a stroke
        },
        child: CustomPaint(
          // Custom painter to draw the lines
          painter: FreehandPainter(points),
          child: Container(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Custom painter class to handle the drawing
class FreehandPainter extends CustomPainter {
  final List<Offset?> points;

  FreehandPainter(this.points);

  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    // Paint settings
    Paint paint = Paint()
      ..color = Colors.black // Color of the drawing
      ..strokeCap = StrokeCap.round // Round stroke cap for smooth edges
      ..strokeWidth = 5.0; // Width of the stroke

    // Draw lines between the points
    for (int i = 0; i < points.length - 1; i++) {
      if (points[i] != null && points[i + 1] != null) {
        canvas.drawLine(points[i]!, points[i + 1]!, paint);
      }
    }
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(covariant CustomPainter oldDelegate) {
    return true; // Repaint whenever the points change
  }
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The app starts with the `main` function, which runs the `MyApp` widget.
2. `MyApp` sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home screen as `RealFlutter`.
3. In `RealFlutter`, a `GestureDetector` captures user touch events.
4. When the user drags their finger, `onPanUpdate` is triggered, and the current position is added to the `points` list.
5. When the user lifts their finger, `onPanEnd` adds a null value to indicate the end of a stroke.
6. The `CustomPaint` widget uses `FreehandPainter` to draw lines based on the points collected.
7. The `FreehandPainter` class handles the actual drawing on the canvas, connecting the points with lines.
8. The app continuously updates the drawing as the user interacts with the screen.
