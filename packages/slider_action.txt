# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Slider Action

## Installation
To add the `slider_action` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  slider_action: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your slider interacts with device features (like volume control).

## Basic Usage
To use the `slider_action` package, you can create a simple slider in your Flutter widget tree. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:slider_action/slider_action.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Slider Action Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: SliderAction(
          min: 0,
          max: 100,
          onChanged: (value) {
            // Handle the value change
            print('Slider value: $value');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code creates a simple slider that prints the current value to the console whenever it changes. You can customize the slider further by adjusting its properties.

# Complete Example of Slider Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:slider_action/slider_action.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Slider Action Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Slider Action Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: SliderAction(
            min: 0, // Minimum value of the slider
            max: 100, // Maximum value of the slider
            initialValue: 50, // Starting value of the slider
            onChanged: (value) {
              // This function is called whenever the slider value changes
              print('Slider value: $value'); // Print the current value
            },
            onAction: () {
              // This function is called when the slider is released
              print('Slider action triggered!'); // Notify that action was triggered
            },
            activeColor: Colors.blue, // Color of the slider when active
            inactiveColor: Colors.grey, // Color of the slider when inactive
            thumbColor: Colors.red, // Color of the slider thumb
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds the SliderAction.
// 4. The SliderAction is configured with a range from 0 to 100, an initial value of 50, and custom colors.
// 5. The onChanged callback prints the current slider value to the console whenever the slider is moved.
// 6. The onAction callback is triggered when the user releases the slider, printing a notification to the console.
