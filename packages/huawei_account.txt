# Tutorial: Setting Up the Huawei Account Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `huawei_account` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `huawei_account` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  huawei_account: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update Android Manifest**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions and metadata:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>

   <application>
       ...
       <meta-data
           android:name="com.huawei.hms.client.appid"
           android:value="your_app_id"/>
   </application>
   ```

   Replace `your_app_id` with your actual Huawei App ID.

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure that your `android/build.gradle` file includes the necessary repositories:

   ```groovy
   allprojects {
       repositories {
           google()
           mavenCentral()
           maven { url 'https://developer.huawei.com/repo/maven/' }
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

   ```xml
   <key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
   <array>
       <dict>
           <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
           <array>
               <string>your_app_id</string>
           </array>
       </dict>
   </array>
   ```

   Replace `your_app_id` with your actual Huawei App ID.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to authenticate a user using their Huawei account.

# Complete Example: Huawei Account Authentication

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:huawei_account/huawei_account.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Huawei Account Example',
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomePageState createState() => _HomePageState();
}

class _HomePageState extends State<HomePage> {
  String _userInfo = "Not logged in";

  // Method to handle Huawei account sign-in
  Future<void> _signIn() async {
    try {
      // Create an instance of the HuaweiAccount
      final HuaweiAccount account = HuaweiAccount();

      // Start the sign-in process
      final result = await account.signIn();

      // If successful, update the user info
      setState(() {
        _userInfo = "Logged in as: ${result.displayName}";
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors during sign-in
      setState(() {
        _userInfo = "Sign-in failed: $e";
      });
    }
  }

  // Method to handle sign-out
  Future<void> _signOut() async {
    try {
      final HuaweiAccount account = HuaweiAccount();
      await account.signOut();
      setState(() {
        _userInfo = "Not logged in";
      });
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        _userInfo = "Sign-out failed: $e";
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Huawei Account Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(_userInfo), // Display user info
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _signIn, // Sign-in button
              child: Text('Sign In with Huawei'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _signOut, // Sign-out button
              child: Text('Sign Out'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a HomePage as its home.
// 3. The HomePage contains a stateful widget that manages user authentication.
// 4. When the user taps the "Sign In with Huawei" button, the _signIn method is called.
// 5. The _signIn method attempts to authenticate the user using the Huawei account service.
// 6. If successful, the user's display name is shown; if it fails, an error message is displayed.
// 7. The "Sign Out" button calls the _signOut method, which logs the user out and updates the UI accordingly.
```
