# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Package
=============================================

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

To use the `colorful_progress_indicators` package, you'll need to add it to your project's `pubspec.yaml` file. Simply add the following line to the `dependencies` section:
```yml
dependencies:
  colorful_progress_indicators: ^1.0.0
```
Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package using the following line:
```dart
import 'package:colorful_progress_indicators/colorful_progress_indicators.dart';
```
### Step 3: Use the Progress Indicators

The package provides two main widgets: `LinearProgressIndicator` and `CircularProgressIndicator`. You can use them in your code like this:
```dart
LinearProgressIndicator(
  colors: [Colors.blue, Colors.green, Colors.yellow],
  animationStyle: AnimationStyle.wave,
)

CircularProgressIndicator(
  colors: [Colors.red, Colors.orange, Colors.purple],
  animationStyle: AnimationStyle.spin,
)
```
You can customize the colors and animation styles to fit your needs.

### Platform-Specific Details

The package works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms. However, if you're using a specific platform, you may need to add some additional configurations or optimizations.

For example, on Android, you may need to add the following line to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file to ensure that the progress indicators are displayed correctly:
```xml
<application
  ...
  android:hardwareAccelerated="true"
  ...
>
```
On iOS, you may need to add the following line to your `Info.plist` file to ensure that the progress indicators are displayed correctly:
```xml
<key>UIRequiresFullScreen</key>
<true/>
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:colorful_progress_indicators/colorful_progress_indicators.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Colorful Progress Indicators Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Colorful Progress Indicators Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Linear Progress Indicator
            LinearProgressIndicator(
              colors: [Colors.blue, Colors.green, Colors.yellow],
              animationStyle: AnimationStyle.wave,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Circular Progress Indicator
            CircularProgressIndicator(
              colors: [Colors.red, Colors.orange, Colors.purple],
              animationStyle: AnimationStyle.spin,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app, and the `RealFlutter` widget is displayed.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` widget builds the `MaterialApp` widget, which is the root of the app.
// 3. The `MaterialApp` widget builds the `MyHomePage` widget, which is the home page of the app.
// 4. The `MyHomePage` widget builds the `Scaffold` widget, which provides the basic material design layout structure.
// 5. The `Scaffold` widget builds the `AppBar` widget, which displays the title of the app.
// 6. The `Scaffold` widget also builds the `Center` widget, which centers its child widget.
// 7. The `Center` widget builds the `Column` widget, which displays its children in a vertical column.
// 8. The `Column` widget builds two progress indicators: a linear progress indicator and a circular progress indicator.
// 9. The progress indicators are displayed with different colors and animation styles.
