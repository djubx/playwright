# HotReloader Flutter Package

The **HotReloader** package for Flutter is a powerful tool designed to enhance the development experience by allowing developers to see changes in real-time without needing to restart the application. This package is particularly useful during the development phase, where rapid iterations and testing are essential.

## When to Use HotReloader

- **Rapid Development**: When you are actively developing a Flutter application and need to see changes immediately.
- **UI Tweaks**: When making adjustments to the UI, such as layout changes, color adjustments, or widget modifications.
- **Debugging**: When debugging issues and needing to test changes without the overhead of a full application restart.

## Features

- **Instant Feedback**: See changes in the UI instantly as you modify the code.
- **State Preservation**: Retain the application state even after making changes, which is crucial for testing user interactions.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

The HotReloader package is an essential tool for Flutter developers looking to streamline their workflow and improve productivity.

# Tutorial: Setting Up HotReloader

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the HotReloader package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter projects.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the HotReloader package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  hotreloader: ^1.0.0  # Add this line
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Configuring for Android

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    buildTypes {
        debug {
            // Enable hot reload for debug builds
            ext.enableHotReload = true
        }
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Configuring for iOS

For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set correctly in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # Ensure this is set to at least 10.0
```

## Step 4: Using HotReloader in Your App

To utilize HotReloader, you need to wrap your main application widget with the `HotReloader` widget. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:hotreloader/hotreloader.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(HotReloader(child: RealFlutter()));
}
```

This setup allows you to take full advantage of the hot reloading capabilities provided by the package.

# Complete Example of HotReloader in Action

Below is a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the HotReloader package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:hotreloader/hotreloader.dart';

// Main entry point of the application
void main() {
  // Run the app with HotReloader enabled
  runApp(HotReloader(child: RealFlutter()));
}

// The main application widget
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'HotReloader Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

// Home screen widget
class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  // State variable to keep track of the counter
  int _counter = 0;

  // Method to increment the counter
  void _incrementCounter() {
    setState(() {
      _counter++; // Increment the counter
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('HotReloader Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'You have pushed the button this many times:',
            ),
            Text(
              '$_counter', // Display the counter value
              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline4,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: _incrementCounter, // Call increment method on press
        tooltip: 'Increment',
        child: Icon(Icons.add), // Button icon
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation

// The application starts with the main function, which runs the HotReloader widget wrapping the RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// The HomeScreen widget is the main screen of the app, which maintains a counter state.
// The counter is displayed in the center of the screen, and a FloatingActionButton is provided to increment the counter.
// When the button is pressed, the _incrementCounter method is called, which updates the state and triggers a rebuild of the UI.
// Thanks to HotReloader, any changes made to the UI or logic can be seen instantly without restarting the app, preserving the current state.
