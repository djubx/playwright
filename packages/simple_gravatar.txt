# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Simple Gravatar

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **simple_gravatar** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **simple_gravatar** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  simple_gravatar: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable the `NSAppTransportSecurity` settings in your `Info.plist` file to allow HTTP requests if you are not using HTTPS:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is an example of how to fetch and display a Gravatar image.

# Complete Example of Using Simple Gravatar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simple_gravatar/simple_gravatar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Simple Gravatar Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Gravatar Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: GravatarImage(
            email: 'user@example.com', // Replace with the user's email
            size: 100, // Size of the Gravatar image
            defaultImage: GravatarImage.defaultImageIdenticon, // Default image if Gravatar is not found
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The RealFlutter class is the main entry point of the application.
// It builds a MaterialApp with a simple Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// Inside the Center widget, we use the GravatarImage widget to display the user's Gravatar image.
// The email parameter is set to 'user@example.com', which should be replaced with the actual user's email.
// The size parameter controls the dimensions of the Gravatar image, set to 100 pixels.
// The defaultImage parameter specifies what to display if the Gravatar image is not available, using an identicon as the default.
// This setup allows for a straightforward display of user avatars in the application.
```
