# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `ffmpeg_kit_flutter`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `ffmpeg_kit_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ffmpeg_kit_flutter: ^x.x.x  # Replace with the latest version
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update Android Manifest**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Make sure your `android/app/build.gradle` file includes the following:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Add the following permissions to your `Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to select videos.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio recording.</string>
```

2. **CocoaPods**: Ensure you run `pod install` in the `ios` directory after adding the dependency.

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Hereâ€™s how to use the `ffmpeg_kit_flutter` package in your Flutter application:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ffmpeg_kit_flutter/ffmpeg_kit.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('FFmpeg Kit Flutter Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Example command to convert a video
              String command = '-i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 output.mp4';
              await FFmpegKit.execute(command).then((session) async {
                final returnCode = await session.getReturnCode();
                if (ReturnCode.isSuccess(returnCode)) {
                  print('Conversion successful!');
                } else {
                  print('Conversion failed with return code: $returnCode');
                }
              });
            },
            child: Text('Convert Video'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app with a button that triggers a video conversion command when pressed.

# Complete Example: A Functional Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ffmpeg_kit_flutter/ffmpeg_kit.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('FFmpeg Kit Flutter Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Define the FFmpeg command for video conversion
              String command = '-i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 output.mp4';
              
              // Execute the FFmpeg command
              await FFmpegKit.execute(command).then((session) async {
                // Get the return code of the command execution
                final returnCode = await session.getReturnCode();
                
                // Check if the command was successful
                if (ReturnCode.isSuccess(returnCode)) {
                  print('Conversion successful!'); // Notify success
                } else {
                  print('Conversion failed with return code: $returnCode'); // Notify failure
                }
              });
            },
            child: Text('Convert Video'), // Button text
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and displays a button labeled 'Convert Video'.
// 2. When the button is pressed, it triggers the FFmpeg command to convert 'input.mp4' to 'output.mp4'.
// 3. The command is executed asynchronously, allowing the UI to remain responsive.
// 4. After execution, the return code is checked to determine if the conversion was successful or not.
// 5. A message is printed to the console based on the success or failure of the operation.
```
