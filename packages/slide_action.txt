## When to Use

You might consider using the **slide_action** package in scenarios such as:
- Implementing swipe gestures for list items (e.g., to delete or edit).
- Creating custom interactive cards that reveal more options when swiped.
- Enhancing user experience by providing quick actions without navigating away from the current screen.

## Features

- **Customizable Actions**: You can define multiple actions that can be triggered by swiping.
- **Flexible Design**: The package allows for a high degree of customization in terms of appearance and behavior.
- **Easy Integration**: It can be easily integrated into existing Flutter applications with minimal setup.

Overall, the **slide_action** package enhances the interactivity of Flutter applications, making it easier for users to perform actions quickly and intuitively.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Slide Action

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **slide_action** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  slide_action: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the platform version in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:slide_action/slide_action.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using Slide Action

You can now use the `SlideAction` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
SlideAction(
  child: Container(
    color: Colors.blue,
    child: Center(child: Text('Swipe me')),
  ),
  action: SlideAction(
    child: Container(
      color: Colors.red,
      child: Center(child: Text('Action')),
    ),
    onTap: () {
      // Define what happens when the action is tapped
      print('Action tapped!');
    },
  ),
)
```

This code creates a swipeable widget that reveals an action when swiped.

# Complete Example of Slide Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:slide_action/slide_action.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Slide Action Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Slide Action Demo'),
        ),
        body: SlideActionDemo(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SlideActionDemo extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ListView.builder(
      itemCount: 10, // Number of items in the list
      itemBuilder: (context, index) {
        return SlideAction(
          // The main content of the list item
          child: Container(
            height: 100,
            color: Colors.blue,
            child: Center(child: Text('Item $index')),
          ),
          // The action that appears when swiped
          action: SlideAction(
            child: Container(
              color: Colors.red,
              child: Center(child: Text('Delete')),
            ),
            onTap: () {
              // Action to perform when the delete action is tapped
              print('Deleted Item $index');
            },
          ),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets up the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The SlideActionDemo widget is created, which contains a ListView.
// 4. The ListView.builder creates a list of SlideAction widgets.
// 5. Each SlideAction has a main content area (blue) and an action area (red).
// 6. When the user swipes the item, the red action area appears, allowing the user to delete the item.
// 7. Tapping the red area triggers the onTap function, which prints a message to the console.
