# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Simple_3D

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **simple_3d** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **simple_3d** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  simple_3d: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version required
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0' # Minimum iOS version required
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that the package is set up, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to create a 3D cube.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simple_3d/simple_3d.dart';
```

2. Create a new widget that utilizes the **simple_3d** package:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Simple 3D Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Simple3D(
          // Define your 3D object here
          object: Cube(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Finally, run your application to see the 3D cube rendered on the screen.

With these steps, you have successfully set up and used the **simple_3d** package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Simple_3D in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simple_3d/simple_3d.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Simple 3D Example',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Simple 3D Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Simple3D(
          // Create a 3D cube object
          object: Cube(
            color: Colors.blue, // Set the color of the cube
            size: 100.0, // Set the size of the cube
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to RealFlutter, which is the main screen of the app.
// 4. RealFlutter builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a centered Simple3D widget.
// 5. The Simple3D widget displays a Cube object with specified color and size.
// 6. When the app runs, the user sees a blue 3D cube rendered in the center of the screen.
```
