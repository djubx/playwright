# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using vector_map_tiles_pmtiles

## Installation
To get started with the `vector_map_tiles_pmtiles` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  vector_map_tiles_pmtiles: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/vector_map_tiles_pmtiles).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
```

3. If you are using offline maps, ensure you have the necessary storage permissions.

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following keys for location services:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show maps.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show maps.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
Hereâ€™s how to use the `vector_map_tiles_pmtiles` package in your Flutter application:

1. Import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:vector_map_tiles_pmtiles/vector_map_tiles_pmtiles.dart';
```

2. Create a simple Flutter app that displays a map:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Vector Map Tiles Example')),
        body: VectorMap(
          // Specify the source of your vector tiles
          tileProvider: NetworkTileProvider(
            urlTemplate: 'https://your-tile-server/{z}/{x}/{y}.pbf',
          ),
          // Set the initial camera position
          initialCameraPosition: CameraPosition(
            target: LatLng(37.7749, -122.4194), // San Francisco coordinates
            zoom: 12,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application that displays a vector map centered on San Francisco. The `VectorMap` widget is used to render the map, and you can customize the `urlTemplate` to point to your vector tile server.

# Complete Example of vector_map_tiles_pmtiles

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:vector_map_tiles_pmtiles/vector_map_tiles_pmtiles.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Vector Map Tiles Example')),
        body: VectorMap(
          // Specify the source of your vector tiles
          tileProvider: NetworkTileProvider(
            urlTemplate: 'https://your-tile-server/{z}/{x}/{y}.pbf',
          ),
          // Set the initial camera position
          initialCameraPosition: CameraPosition(
            target: LatLng(37.7749, -122.4194), // San Francisco coordinates
            zoom: 12,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the `RealFlutter` class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. Inside the `build` method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// 3. The AppBar displays the title "Vector Map Tiles Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a `VectorMap` widget.
// 5. The `VectorMap` widget uses a `NetworkTileProvider` to fetch vector tiles from a specified URL template.
// 6. The initial camera position is set to San Francisco's coordinates with a zoom level of 12.
// 7. When the app runs, it will display the vector map centered on the specified location, allowing users to interact with it.
