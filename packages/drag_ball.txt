# Drag Ball Flutter Package

The **drag_ball** Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to create draggable and interactive ball animations within your Flutter applications. This package is particularly useful for games, educational apps, or any application that requires user interaction through dragging gestures. 

## When to Use This Package
You might consider using the **drag_ball** package in scenarios such as:
- **Game Development**: Implementing draggable game elements like balls or characters.
- **Interactive Learning**: Creating educational tools where users can drag items to learn concepts.
- **UI Enhancements**: Adding engaging UI components that respond to user gestures.

## Features
- **Customizable Ball Properties**: You can easily customize the size, color, and behavior of the draggable ball.
- **Gesture Detection**: The package provides built-in gesture detection to handle drag events smoothly.
- **Animation Support**: It supports animations for a more dynamic user experience.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Drag Ball Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the **drag_ball** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  drag_ball: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file if your app requires them. However, for basic usage of the **drag_ball** package, no additional configurations are typically required.

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a draggable ball.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:drag_ball/drag_ball.dart'; // Import the drag_ball package

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Drag Ball Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: DraggableBall(
            // Customize the ball properties
            size: 100.0,
            color: Colors.blue,
            onDragEnd: (details) {
              // Handle the end of the drag
              print('Drag ended at: ${details.offset}');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with a draggable blue ball. The `DraggableBall` widget is used to create the ball, and you can customize its size and color. The `onDragEnd` callback allows you to handle the event when the dragging ends.

# Complete Example of Drag Ball Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:drag_ball/drag_ball.dart'; // Import the drag_ball package

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Drag Ball Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: DraggableBall(
            // Customize the ball properties
            size: 100.0, // Set the size of the ball
            color: Colors.blue, // Set the color of the ball
            onDragEnd: (details) {
              // Handle the end of the drag
              print('Drag ended at: ${details.offset}'); // Log the position where the drag ended
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the application
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, a DraggableBall is created with specified size and color.
// 4. The onDragEnd callback is defined to log the position where the ball was released after dragging.
// 5. When the user drags the ball and releases it, the position is printed to the console, demonstrating the drag functionality.
```

In summary, the **drag_ball** package provides an easy way to implement draggable elements in your Flutter applications. The example above demonstrates how to set up the package, create a draggable ball, and handle drag events effectively. By following the tutorial and understanding the complete example, you can enhance your applications with interactive features that engage users.
