# Setting Up and Using the Gemini Flutter Package

## Installation
To get started with the gemini_flutter package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  gemini_flutter: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file. Add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` to allow network requests. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the gemini_flutter package, you will typically start by initializing the API client and then making requests to fetch market data or execute trades. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initialize the client:

```dart
import 'package:gemini_flutter/gemini_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  final client = RealFlutter(apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY', apiSecret: 'YOUR_API_SECRET');
  // Now you can use the client to fetch data or execute trades
}
```

Make sure to replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` and `'YOUR_API_SECRET'` with your actual Gemini API credentials.

# Complete Example of Using the Gemini Flutter Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gemini_flutter/gemini_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Gemini Flutter Example',
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomePageState createState() => _HomePageState();
}

class _HomePageState extends State<HomePage> {
  late RealFlutter client; // Declare the client variable
  String marketData = ''; // Variable to hold market data

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the Gemini client with API credentials
    client = RealFlutter(apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY', apiSecret: 'YOUR_API_SECRET');
    fetchMarketData(); // Fetch market data when the app starts
  }

  // Function to fetch market data
  void fetchMarketData() async {
    try {
      // Fetch the latest market data
      final data = await client.getMarketData('BTCUSD');
      setState(() {
        marketData = data.toString(); // Update the state with fetched data
      });
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error fetching market data: $e'); // Handle errors
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Gemini Market Data'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(marketData.isNotEmpty ? marketData : 'Loading...'), // Display market data
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the `main` function, which runs the `MyApp` widget.
// 2. `MyApp` builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home page.
// 3. The `HomePage` widget initializes the `RealFlutter` client in its `initState` method.
// 4. It calls `fetchMarketData` to retrieve market data for the BTC/USD pair.
// 5. The fetched data is stored in the `marketData` variable and displayed in the center of the screen.
// 6. If the data is still loading, it shows 'Loading...' until the data is fetched.
