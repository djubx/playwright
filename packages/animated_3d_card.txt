# Complete Example of animated_3d_card

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_3d_card/animated_3d_card.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animated 3D Card Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('3D Card Animation'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Animated3DCard(
            // Setting the card's front and back widgets
            frontWidget: Card(
              color: Colors.blue,
              child: SizedBox(
                width: 200,
                height: 300,
                child: Center(
                  child: Text(
                    'Front',
                    style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24),
                  ),
                ),
              ),
            ),
            backWidget: Card(
              color: Colors.red,
              child: SizedBox(
                width: 200,
                height: 300,
                child: Center(
                  child: Text(
                    'Back',
                    style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24),
                  ),
                ),
              ),
            ),
            // Animation duration
            duration: Duration(milliseconds: 600),
            // Optional: Add shadow to the card
            elevation: 8.0,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Explanation of the application flow:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title '3D Card Animation'.
// 4. In the body of the Scaffold, we center the Animated3DCard widget.
// 5. The Animated3DCard widget takes two child widgets: frontWidget and backWidget, which are defined as Cards with different colors and text.
// 6. The duration of the animation is set to 600 milliseconds, and an elevation is added for a shadow effect.
// 7. When the user interacts with the card, it will animate between the front and back views, providing a smooth 3D effect.
