# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Rating Summary Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `rating_summary` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  rating_summary: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` file to include any necessary permissions or configurations, depending on your app's requirements. However, the `rating_summary` package does not require specific configurations for basic usage.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `rating_summary` widget.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:rating_summary/rating_summary.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Rating Summary Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Rating Summary Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: RatingSummary(
            rating: 4.5, // Average rating
            totalRatings: 150, // Total number of ratings
            starColor: Colors.amber, // Color of the stars
            starSize: 30.0, // Size of the stars
            showTotalRatings: true, // Show total ratings count
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that displays a rating summary in the center of the screen. The `RatingSummary` widget takes parameters such as `rating`, `totalRatings`, `starColor`, `starSize`, and `showTotalRatings` to customize its appearance.

# Complete Example of the Rating Summary Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:rating_summary/rating_summary.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Rating Summary Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Rating Summary Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: RatingSummary(
            rating: 4.5, // Average rating
            totalRatings: 150, // Total number of ratings
            starColor: Colors.amber, // Color of the stars
            starSize: 30.0, // Size of the stars
            showTotalRatings: true, // Show total ratings count
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The runApp function initializes the app and takes the RealFlutter widget as the root widget.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 4. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Rating Summary Example".
// 5. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains the RatingSummary widget.
// 6. The RatingSummary widget displays an average rating of 4.5, with a total of 150 ratings.
// 7. The stars are colored amber and have a size of 30.0.
// 8. The total ratings count is displayed below the stars, providing users with a clear understanding of the rating.
