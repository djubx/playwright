In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **flutter_boxicons** package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **flutter_boxicons** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

```

## Step 3: Using Boxicons in Your Widgets

You can now use Boxicons in your Flutter widgets. Here’s a simple example of how to use an icon:

```dart
Boxicon.bx_alarm, // This will display an alarm icon
```

### Platform-Specific Details

    }
}
```

# Complete Example of Using Flutter Boxicons

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_boxicons/flutter_boxicons.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Boxicons Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Boxicons Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying a Boxicon alarm icon
              Icon(
                Boxicon.bx_alarm,
                size: 50.0, // Setting the size of the icon
                color: Colors.red, // Setting the color of the icon
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              // Displaying a Boxicon user icon
              Icon(
                Boxicon.bx_user,
                size: 50.0, // Setting the size of the icon
                color: Colors.green, // Setting the color of the icon
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              // Displaying a Boxicon heart icon
              Icon(
                Boxicon.bx_heart,
                size: 50.0, // Setting the size of the icon
                color: Colors.pink, // Setting the color of the icon
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Flutter Boxicons Demo".
// In the body of the Scaffold, we have a Center widget that centers its child.
// The child is a Column widget that arranges its children vertically.
// Inside the Column, we display three Boxicons: an alarm icon, a user icon, and a heart icon.
// Each icon is wrapped in an Icon widget, where we set the size and color.
// SizedBox widgets are used to add space between the icons for better visual separation.
// This simple application demonstrates how to use the flutter_boxicons package effectively.
