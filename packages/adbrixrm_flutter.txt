# ADBrixRM Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the `adbrixrm_flutter` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  adbrixrm_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/adbrixrm_flutter).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

3. Add the ADBrix SDK initialization in your `MainActivity.java` or `MainActivity.kt`:

```java
import io.flutter.embedding.android.FlutterActivity;

public class MainActivity extends FlutterActivity {
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        // Initialize ADBrix SDK here
    }
}
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

3. Initialize the ADBrix SDK in your `AppDelegate.swift`:

```swift
import UIKit
import Flutter

@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: FlutterAppDelegate {
    override func application(
        _ application: UIApplication,
        didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?
    ) -> Bool {
        // Initialize ADBrix SDK here
        return super.application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: launchOptions)
    }
}
```

## Usage
Once you have installed and configured the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to track an event:

```dart
import 'package:adbrixrm_flutter/adbrixrm_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('ADBrixRM Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Track a button click event
            RealFlutter.trackEvent('button_click', {'button_name': 'example_button'});
          },
          child: Text('Click Me'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to track a button click event using the `adbrixrm_flutter` package. The `trackEvent` method sends the event data to ADBrix for analysis.

# ADBrixRM Flutter Package: Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:adbrixrm_flutter/adbrixrm_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'ADBrixRM Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('ADBrixRM Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Track a button click event
            RealFlutter.trackEvent('button_click', {'button_name': 'example_button'});
          },
          child: Text('Click Me'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp widget with a title and sets HomeScreen as the home widget.
// 3. HomeScreen builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget containing an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is clicked, the onPressed callback is triggered.
// 5. Inside the callback, the RealFlutter.trackEvent method is called to log the button click event.
// 6. The event data includes the event name 'button_click' and a map with the button's name.
// 7. This data is sent to ADBrix for tracking and analysis, allowing developers to monitor user interactions.
