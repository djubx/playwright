# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Appinio Video Player

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the Appinio Video Player package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the Appinio Video Player package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  appinio_video_player: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/appinio_video_player).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. Ensure that your deployment target is set to at least iOS 10.0 in `ios/Podfile`:

   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Appinio Video Player

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the Appinio Video Player.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:appinio_video_player/appinio_video_player.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Appinio Video Player Example',
      home: VideoPlayerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class VideoPlayerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _VideoPlayerScreenState createState() => _VideoPlayerScreenState();
}

class _VideoPlayerScreenState extends State<VideoPlayerScreen> {
  late AppinioVideoPlayerController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the video player controller with a video URL
    _controller = AppinioVideoPlayerController.network(
      'https://www.example.com/video.mp4',
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the controller when the widget is removed from the widget tree
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Appinio Video Player'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: AppinioVideoPlayer(
          controller: _controller,
          // Customize the player UI
          aspectRatio: 16 / 9,
          // Add event listeners for playback status
          onVideoEnd: () {
            // Action to take when the video ends
            print('Video has ended');
          },
          onError: (error) {
            // Handle any errors during playback
            print('Error: $error');
          },
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          // Play or pause the video based on its current state
          if (_controller.value.isPlaying) {
            _controller.pause();
          } else {
            _controller.play();
          }
        },
        child: Icon(
          _controller.value.isPlaying ? Icons.pause : Icons.play_arrow,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets RealFlutter as the root widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (VideoPlayerScreen).
// 3. VideoPlayerScreen initializes the AppinioVideoPlayerController with a video URL.
// 4. The video player is displayed in the center of the screen with a customizable aspect ratio.
// 5. A FloatingActionButton is provided to play or pause the video based on its current state.
// 6. Event listeners are set up to handle video end and error events, providing feedback in the console.
