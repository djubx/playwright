# Flutter Eco Mode Package: A Comprehensive Overview

The `flutter_eco_mode` package is designed to help Flutter developers implement eco-friendly features in their applications. This package allows developers to optimize their apps for energy efficiency, which is increasingly important in today's mobile landscape. By using this package, developers can create applications that not only perform well but also contribute to sustainability by reducing energy consumption.

## When to Use This Package
- **Sustainability-Focused Apps**: If your application targets environmentally conscious users or industries, this package can help you align with their values.
- **Battery-Intensive Applications**: For apps that require significant processing power or frequent updates, using eco mode can help extend battery life.
- **IoT Applications**: In Internet of Things (IoT) applications, where devices often run on limited power, this package can optimize energy usage.

## Key Features
- **Energy Consumption Monitoring**: Track the energy usage of your application in real-time.
- **Adaptive Performance**: Automatically adjust the app's performance based on the current battery level and user preferences.
- **User Notifications**: Inform users when the app is running in eco mode and how it affects performance.
- **Customizable Settings**: Allow users to customize their eco mode preferences for a personalized experience.

By integrating the `flutter_eco_mode` package, developers can create applications that are not only efficient but also promote a sustainable future.

# Setting Up and Using the Flutter Eco Mode Package

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_eco_mode` package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Installation

To add the `flutter_eco_mode` package to your Flutter project, follow these steps:

1. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file.
2. Add the package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     flutter_eco_mode: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
   ```

3. Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file. Add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BATTERY_STATS"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add specific configurations in your `Info.plist` file to handle battery usage notifications. Ensure you include:

```xml
<key>NSBatteryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app optimizes battery usage for eco-friendly performance.</string>
```

## Using the Package

To use the `flutter_eco_mode` package, you can follow these steps in your Flutter application:

1. Import the package:

   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter_eco_mode/flutter_eco_mode.dart';
   ```

2. Initialize the eco mode in your main application file:

   ```dart
   void main() {
     runApp(MyApp());
     EcoMode.initialize();
   }
   ```

3. Use the eco mode features in your app:

   ```dart
   EcoMode.setEcoMode(true); // Enable eco mode
   ```

4. Monitor energy consumption:

   ```dart
   EcoMode.onEnergyUsageChanged.listen((usage) {
     print("Current energy usage: $usage");
   });
   ```

By following these steps, you can effectively integrate the `flutter_eco_mode` package into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using the Flutter Eco Mode Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_eco_mode/flutter_eco_mode.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp()); // Start the Flutter application
  EcoMode.initialize(); // Initialize the eco mode package
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Eco Mode Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.green, // Use green theme to represent eco-friendliness
      ),
      home: EcoModeHome(), // Set the home widget
    );
  }
}

class EcoModeHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _EcoModeHomeState createState() => _EcoModeHomeState();
}

class _EcoModeHomeState extends State<EcoModeHome> {
  bool _isEcoModeEnabled = false; // Track eco mode status
  double _energyUsage = 0.0; // Track energy usage

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Listen for energy usage changes
    EcoMode.onEnergyUsageChanged.listen((usage) {
      setState(() {
        _energyUsage = usage; // Update energy usage state
      });
    });
  }

  void _toggleEcoMode() {
    setState(() {
      _isEcoModeEnabled = !_isEcoModeEnabled; // Toggle eco mode status
      EcoMode.setEcoMode(_isEcoModeEnabled); // Set eco mode
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Eco Mode Example'), // App title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Eco Mode is ${_isEcoModeEnabled ? "Enabled" : "Disabled"}', // Display eco mode status
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(
              'Current Energy Usage: ${_energyUsage.toStringAsFixed(2)} W', // Display current energy usage
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _toggleEcoMode, // Toggle eco mode on button press
              child: Text('Toggle Eco Mode'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application that utilizes the flutter_eco_mode package.
// 
// 1. The main function initializes the app and the EcoMode package.
// 2. MyApp is the root widget that sets up the MaterialApp with a green theme.
// 3. EcoModeHome is a stateful widget that manages the eco mode state and energy usage.
// 4. In the initState method, we listen for changes in energy usage and update the state accordingly.
// 5. The _toggleEcoMode method toggles the eco mode on and off, updating the UI.
// 6. The build method constructs the UI, displaying the current eco mode status and energy usage, along with a button to toggle eco mode.
// 
// This application flow allows users to see how enabling eco mode affects energy consumption, promoting awareness of energy efficiency.
