# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Swipeable Button View

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `swipeable_button_view` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  swipeable_button_view: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the platform version in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Swipeable Button View

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `SwipeableButtonView`.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:swipeable_button_view/swipeable_button_view.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Swipeable Button View Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: SwipeableButtonView(
            onChange: (position) {
              // This callback is triggered when the button is swiped
              if (position == SwipeableButtonPosition.end) {
                // Action to perform when swiped to the end
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Action Confirmed!')),
                );
              }
            },
            buttonText: 'Swipe to Confirm',
            buttonColor: Colors.blue,
            backgroundColor: Colors.grey[300],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple app with a swipeable button that confirms an action when swiped to the end.

# Complete Example of Swipeable Button View

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:swipeable_button_view/swipeable_button_view.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Swipeable Button View Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: SwipeableButtonView(
            onChange: (position) {
              // This callback is triggered when the button is swiped
              if (position == SwipeableButtonPosition.end) {
                // Action to perform when swiped to the end
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Action Confirmed!')),
                );
              }
            },
            buttonText: 'Swipe to Confirm',
            buttonColor: Colors.blue,
            backgroundColor: Colors.grey[300],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the `RealFlutter` class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The `MaterialApp` widget is created, providing the app structure.
// 3. A `Scaffold` widget is used to create the basic visual layout, including an AppBar and a body.
// 4. In the body, a `Center` widget is used to center the `SwipeableButtonView`.
// 5. The `SwipeableButtonView` is configured with a callback function that listens for swipe changes.
// 6. When the button is swiped to the end, a SnackBar is displayed to confirm the action.
// 7. The button's text, button color, and background color are customizable properties.
