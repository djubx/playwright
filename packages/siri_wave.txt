# Siri Wave Flutter Package

The **siri_wave** Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to create visually appealing wave animations that can be used in various applications, such as music players, meditation apps, or any app that requires a dynamic visual representation of sound or rhythm. This package leverages Flutter's capabilities to render smooth animations and provides developers with an easy way to integrate waveforms into their applications.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the **siri_wave** package in scenarios such as:
- **Music Applications**: To visualize audio playback with waveforms.
- **Meditation Apps**: To create calming visual effects that respond to sound.
- **Games**: To enhance the user experience with dynamic backgrounds that react to in-game audio.

## Features

- **Customizable Waveforms**: Adjust the amplitude, frequency, and color of the waves.
- **Responsive to Audio**: The waves can react to audio input, providing a real-time visual experience.
- **Smooth Animations**: Built with Flutter's animation capabilities, ensuring smooth transitions and interactions.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that allows for quick setup and customization.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Siri Wave

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **siri_wave** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **siri_wave** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  siri_wave: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/siri_wave).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you plan to use audio features. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio visualization.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the **siri_wave** package.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:siri_wave/siri_wave.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Siri Wave Example',
      home: WaveScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class WaveScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _WaveScreenState createState() => _WaveScreenState();
}

class _WaveScreenState extends State<WaveScreen> {
  // Initialize the SiriWave controller
  late SiriWaveController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Create a new SiriWave controller
    _controller = SiriWaveController();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the controller when the widget is removed from the widget tree
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Siri Wave Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        // Use the SiriWave widget to display the wave
        child: SiriWave(
          controller: _controller,
          // Customize the wave properties
          waveColor: Colors.blue,
          backgroundColor: Colors.black,
          amplitude: 0.5,
          frequency: 1.5,
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          // Start or stop the wave animation
          if (_controller.isPlaying) {
            _controller.stop();
          } else {
            _controller.start();
          }
        },
        child: Icon(_controller.isPlaying ? Icons.pause : Icons.play_arrow),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app and sets MyApp as the home widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (WaveScreen).
// 3. WaveScreen is a stateful widget that manages the SiriWaveController.
// 4. In initState, we create an instance of SiriWaveController to control the wave animation.
// 5. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget containing the SiriWave.
// 6. The SiriWave widget is configured with custom colors, amplitude, and frequency.
// 7. A FloatingActionButton is provided to start or stop the wave animation based on the controller's state.
// 8. When the button is pressed, it toggles the wave animation on or off.
```

## Summary

In this blog, we explored the **siri_wave** Flutter package, detailing its features and providing a step-by-step tutorial on how to set it up and use it in a Flutter application. The complete example demonstrated how to create a simple app that visualizes waveforms, allowing users to start and stop the animation with a button. This package is a great addition for developers looking to enhance their applications with dynamic audio visualizations.
