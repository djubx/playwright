# Tutorial

## Setup Process

To get started with the `scroll_to_id` package, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `scroll_to_id` package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     scroll_to_id: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
   ```

2. **Install the Package**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

     ```groovy
     android {
         ...
         defaultConfig {
             ...
             minSdkVersion 21
         }
     }
     ```

   - **iOS**: No additional configuration is required for iOS, but ensure your deployment target is set appropriately in `ios/Podfile`.

4. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the package:

   ```dart
   import 'package:scroll_to_id/scroll_to_id.dart';
   ```

## Using the Package

To use the `scroll_to_id` package, follow these steps:

1. **Wrap Your Widgets**: Use the `ScrollToId` widget to wrap the widgets you want to scroll to. Assign a unique ID to each widget.

   ```dart
   ScrollToId(
     id: 'my_widget_id',
     child: MyWidget(),
   )
   ```

2. **Scroll to the Widget**: Use the `ScrollToId.scrollTo` method to scroll to the widget when needed. This can be triggered by a button press or any other event.

   ```dart
   ScrollToId.scrollTo('my_widget_id');
   ```

3. **Customize Scrolling**: You can customize the scrolling duration and curve by passing additional parameters to the `scrollTo` method.

By following these steps, you can easily integrate and use the `scroll_to_id` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:scroll_to_id/scroll_to_id.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Scroll to ID Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Scroll to ID Example'),
        ),
        body: ScrollToIdExample(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class ScrollToIdExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return SingleChildScrollView(
      child: Column(
        children: [
          // Button to scroll to the first section
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              ScrollToId.scrollTo('section_1');
            },
            child: Text('Go to Section 1'),
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20),
          // First section
          ScrollToId(
            id: 'section_1',
            child: Container(
              height: 400,
              color: Colors.blue,
              child: Center(child: Text('Section 1', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.white))),
            ),
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20),
          // Button to scroll to the second section
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              ScrollToId.scrollTo('section_2');
            },
            child: Text('Go to Section 2'),
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20),
          // Second section
          ScrollToId(
            id: 'section_2',
            child: Container(
              height: 400,
              color: Colors.green,
              child: Center(child: Text('Section 2', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.white))),
            ),
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20),
          // Button to scroll to the third section
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              ScrollToId.scrollTo('section_3');
            },
            child: Text('Go to Section 3'),
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20),
          // Third section
          ScrollToId(
            id: 'section_3',
            child: Container(
              height: 400,
              color: Colors.red,
              child: Center(child: Text('Section 3', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.white))),
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and the ScrollToIdExample widget.
// 3. ScrollToIdExample contains a SingleChildScrollView that allows vertical scrolling of its children.
// 4. Each section is wrapped in a ScrollToId widget with a unique ID.
// 5. When a button is pressed, the ScrollToId.scrollTo method is called with the corresponding section ID, triggering a smooth scroll to that section.
// 6. The sections are visually distinct, making it easy to see the scrolling effect.
