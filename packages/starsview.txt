              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Display the current rating
              Text('Rating: $_rating'),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Button to change the rating
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  setState(() {
                    _rating = 3.5;
                  });
                },
                child: Text('Change Rating'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and sees the StarsView widget with an initial rating of 4.5.
// 2. The user clicks the "Change Rating" button, which updates the rating to 3.5.
// 3. The StarsView widget animates to reflect the new rating.
// 4. The current rating is displayed below the StarsView widget.
// This example demonstrates how to use the StarsView package to display a rating system and update the rating dynamically.

// Final summary: The code flows by first displaying the StarsView widget with an initial rating, then allowing the user to change the rating, and finally updating the widget to reflect the new rating.
