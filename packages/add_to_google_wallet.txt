# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the `add_to_google_wallet` Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `add_to_google_wallet` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  add_to_google_wallet: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/add_to_google_wallet).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

2. **Enable Google Wallet API**: Ensure that the Google Wallet API is enabled in your Google Cloud Console for your project.

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. **Enable Google Wallet API**: Similar to Android, ensure that the Google Wallet API is enabled in your Google Cloud Console.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have configured your project, you can start using the package in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to add a loyalty card to Google Wallet.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:add_to_google_wallet/add_to_google_wallet.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Add to Google Wallet Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Create a loyalty card object
              final loyaltyCard = LoyaltyCard(
                id: '123456',
                provider: 'Your Company',
                title: 'Your Loyalty Card',
                barcode: Barcode(
                  type: BarcodeType.qrCode,
                  value: 'https://yourcompany.com/loyalty/123456',
                ),
              );

              // Add the loyalty card to Google Wallet
              AddToGoogleWallet.addPass(loyaltyCard);
            },
            child: Text('Add Loyalty Card to Google Wallet'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app with a button that, when pressed, adds a loyalty card to Google Wallet.

# Complete Example of Using the `add_to_google_wallet` Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:add_to_google_wallet/add_to_google_wallet.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Add to Google Wallet Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Create a loyalty card object
              final loyaltyCard = LoyaltyCard(
                id: '123456', // Unique identifier for the loyalty card
                provider: 'Your Company', // Name of the provider
                title: 'Your Loyalty Card', // Title displayed on the card
                barcode: Barcode(
                  type: BarcodeType.qrCode, // Type of barcode
                  value: 'https://yourcompany.com/loyalty/123456', // URL for the barcode
                ),
              );

              // Add the loyalty card to Google Wallet
              AddToGoogleWallet.addPass(loyaltyCard);
            },
            child: Text('Add Loyalty Card to Google Wallet'), // Button text
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the `RealFlutter` class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The `MaterialApp` widget is created, providing the app structure.
// 3. A `Scaffold` widget is used to create the basic visual layout, including an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 5. When the button is pressed, a `LoyaltyCard` object is instantiated with necessary details like id, provider, title, and barcode.
// 6. The `AddToGoogleWallet.addPass()` method is called with the loyalty card object to add it to Google Wallet.
// 7. The user can now access their loyalty card directly from Google Wallet, enhancing convenience and user experience.
