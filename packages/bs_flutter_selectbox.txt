# Tutorial

## Setup Process

To get started with the `bs_flutter_selectbox` package, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     bs_flutter_selectbox: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
   ```

2. **Install the Package**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the correct minSdkVersion. For example:

     ```groovy
     android {
         ...
         defaultConfig {
             ...
             minSdkVersion 21 // or higher
         }
     }
     ```

   - **iOS**: Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and ensure you have the necessary permissions if your select box interacts with device features.

4. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the package:

   ```dart
   import 'package:bs_flutter_selectbox/bs_flutter_selectbox.dart';
   ```

## Using the Package

To use the `bs_flutter_selectbox`, you can create a simple dropdown in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bs_flutter_selectbox/bs_flutter_selectbox.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Select Box Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: SelectBox(
            items: ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3'],
            onChanged: (value) {
              // Handle the selected value
              print('Selected: $value');
            },
            hint: 'Select an option',
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple select box with three options. The `onChanged` callback is triggered when the user selects an option, allowing you to handle the selected value accordingly.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bs_flutter_selectbox/bs_flutter_selectbox.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to hold the selected value
  String? selectedValue;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Select Box Example')),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // SelectBox widget
              SelectBox(
                items: ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3'],
                onChanged: (value) {
                  // Update the selected value
                  setState(() {
                    selectedValue = value;
                  });
                  // Print the selected value
                  print('Selected: $value');
                },
                hint: 'Select an option',
                value: selectedValue, // Set the current selected value
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Display the selected value
              Text(
                selectedValue != null ? 'You selected: $selectedValue' : 'No option selected',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the selected value.
// 3. In the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body consists of a SelectBox widget and a Text widget to display the selected value.
// 5. When the user selects an option from the SelectBox, the onChanged callback is triggered.
// 6. The selected value is updated using setState, which rebuilds the widget with the new value.
// 7. The selected value is displayed below the SelectBox, providing immediate feedback to the user.
