# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Simple Rich Text

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **simple_rich_text** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  simple_rich_text: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the platform version in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simple_rich_text/simple_rich_text.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Simple Rich Text Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: SimpleRichText(
            text: 'Hello, this is a ',
            children: [
              TextSpan(text: 'bold', style: TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold)),
              TextSpan(text: ' and ', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.black)),
              TextSpan(text: 'italic', style: TextStyle(fontStyle: FontStyle.italic)),
              TextSpan(text: ' example.', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.blue)),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that uses the **simple_rich_text** package to display a sentence with different text styles.

# Complete Example of Simple Rich Text

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simple_rich_text/simple_rich_text.dart';

// Main class of the Flutter application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Simple Rich Text Example')), // App bar with title
        body: Center(
          child: SimpleRichText(
            text: 'Hello, this is a ', // Base text
            children: [
              // First child with bold style
              TextSpan(
                text: 'bold',
                style: TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
              ),
              // Second child with default style
              TextSpan(
                text: ' and ',
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.black),
              ),
              // Third child with italic style
              TextSpan(
                text: 'italic',
                style: TextStyle(fontStyle: FontStyle.italic),
              ),
              // Fourth child with blue color
              TextSpan(
                text: ' example.',
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.blue),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp, which provides the basic structure for the app.
3. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold widget is created, which includes an AppBar and a body.
4. The body contains a Center widget that centers its child, which is a SimpleRichText widget.
5. The SimpleRichText widget displays a base text "Hello, this is a " followed by several TextSpan children.
6. Each TextSpan applies different styles to parts of the text, demonstrating the rich text capabilities of the package.
7. The final output is a single line of text with mixed styles, enhancing the visual presentation of the text.
