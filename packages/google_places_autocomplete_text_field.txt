# Tutorial: Setting Up Google Places Autocomplete Text Field

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `google_places_autocomplete_text_field` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  google_places_autocomplete_text_field: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/google_places_autocomplete_text_field).

## Step 2: Obtain Google Places API Key

You need a Google Places API key to use this package. Follow these steps to obtain one:

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create a new project or select an existing one.
3. Navigate to the "APIs & Services" section.
4. Enable the "Places API" for your project.
5. Create credentials to obtain your API key.

## Step 3: Configure Android

For Android, you need to add your API key to the `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<manifest>
    <application>
        <!-- Other configurations -->
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
            android:value="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"/>
    </application>
</manifest>
```

## Step 4: Configure iOS

For iOS, you need to add your API key to the `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>GMSApiKey</key>
<string>YOUR_API_KEY_HERE</string>
```

## Step 5: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the `GooglePlacesAutocompleteTextField` widget.

# Complete Example of Google Places Autocomplete Text Field

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:google_places_autocomplete_text_field/google_places_autocomplete_text_field.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Google Places Autocomplete Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Google Places Autocomplete'),
        ),
        body: PlaceSearchWidget(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class PlaceSearchWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PlaceSearchWidgetState createState() => _PlaceSearchWidgetState();
}

class _PlaceSearchWidgetState extends State<PlaceSearchWidget> {
  // Create a controller for the text field
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
      child: GooglePlacesAutocompleteTextField(
        // Set the controller for the text field
        controller: _controller,
        // Provide your Google Places API key
        apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE',
        // Define the onChanged callback to handle user input
        onChanged: (value) {
          // Handle changes in the text field
          print('Input: $value');
        },
        // Define the onSuggestionSelected callback to handle selection
        onSuggestionSelected: (suggestion) {
          // Handle the selection of a suggestion
          print('Selected: ${suggestion.description}');
          // Optionally, you can clear the text field after selection
          _controller.clear();
        },
        // Customize the appearance of the text field
        decoration: InputDecoration(
          hintText: 'Search for a place',
          border: OutlineInputBorder(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets the home widget to RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and the PlaceSearchWidget.
// 3. PlaceSearchWidget is a StatefulWidget that manages the state of the Google Places Autocomplete Text Field.
// 4. The GooglePlacesAutocompleteTextField widget is created with a controller, API key, and callbacks for input changes and suggestion selection.
// 5. When the user types in the text field, the onChanged callback is triggered, printing the current input.
// 6. When a suggestion is selected, the onSuggestionSelected callback is triggered, printing the selected suggestion and clearing the text field.
```

// The above code demonstrates how to implement the Google Places Autocomplete Text Field in a Flutter application. The application consists of a main widget that initializes the app and a stateful widget that contains the autocomplete text field. The text field is configured with an API key and callbacks to handle user input and suggestion selection. The application flow is straightforward, allowing users to search for places and select suggestions seamlessly.
