# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Assistive Touch Package

## Installation
To use the `assistive_touch` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  assistive_touch: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/assistive_touch).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permission inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add specific configurations in your `Info.plist` file if you are using features that require permissions. However, the basic functionality should work without additional configurations.

## Using the Package
To use the `assistive_touch` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:assistive_touch/assistive_touch.dart';
```

You can then initialize the floating button in your main widget. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set it up:

```dart
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  AssistiveTouch.show(
    onTap: () {
      // Define what happens when the button is tapped
      print("Assistive Touch tapped!");
    },
  );
}
```

Make sure to call `AssistiveTouch.hide()` when you no longer need the button, such as when the widget is disposed.

# Complete Example of Assistive Touch

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:assistive_touch/assistive_touch.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Show the assistive touch button when the app starts
    AssistiveTouch.show(
      onTap: () {
        // Action to perform when the assistive touch button is tapped
        print("Assistive Touch tapped!");
      },
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Hide the assistive touch button when the widget is disposed
    AssistiveTouch.hide();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Assistive Touch Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Tap the floating button!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 3. In the initState method, the assistive touch button is shown.
// 4. When the button is tapped, a message is printed to the console.
// 5. The dispose method hides the assistive touch button when the widget is removed from the widget tree.
// 6. The build method returns a simple UI with an AppBar and a centered text message.
