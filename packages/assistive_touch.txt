// The app starts by running the `main` function, which creates a new instance of the `MyApp` widget.
// The `MyApp` widget builds a `MaterialApp` with a title and a theme.
// The `MaterialApp` has a home property set to `MyHomePage`, which is a stateful widget.
// The `MyHomePage` widget builds a `Scaffold` with an app bar and a body.
// The body of the `Scaffold` contains a `Center` widget with an `AssistiveTouch` widget as its child.
// The `AssistiveTouch` widget is customized with menu items, position, animation duration, haptic feedback, and sound effect.
// When a menu item is tapped, the corresponding callback function is called.
