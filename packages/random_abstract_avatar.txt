# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using random_abstract_avatar

## Installation
To use the `random_abstract_avatar` package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  random_abstract_avatar: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if you plan to use any features that require user permissions. However, for the basic usage of `random_abstract_avatar`, no special permissions are needed.

## Using the Package
To use the `random_abstract_avatar` package, you can import it into your Dart file as follows:

```dart
import 'package:random_abstract_avatar/random_abstract_avatar.dart';
```

You can then generate an avatar by calling the `RandomAbstractAvatar` class and passing the desired parameters.

### Example Usage
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to generate an avatar:

```dart
final avatar = RandomAbstractAvatar(
  size: 100, // Size of the avatar
  colors: [Colors.red, Colors.blue, Colors.green], // Custom colors
);
```

This will create a random abstract avatar with a size of 100 pixels and a color palette consisting of red, blue, and green.

With this setup, you are ready to start using the `random_abstract_avatar` package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of random_abstract_avatar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:random_abstract_avatar/random_abstract_avatar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Random Abstract Avatar Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Random Abstract Avatar Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Generate a random abstract avatar
              RandomAbstractAvatar(
                size: 100, // Set the size of the avatar
                colors: [Colors.red, Colors.blue, Colors.green], // Define a color palette
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Add some space
              Text('Your Random Avatar'), // Label for the avatar
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Random Abstract Avatar Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Column widget.
// 5. Inside the Column, a RandomAbstractAvatar widget is created with a size of 100 pixels and a custom color palette.
// 6. A SizedBox is used to add space between the avatar and the text below it.
// 7. Finally, a Text widget is displayed below the avatar, labeling it as "Your Random Avatar".
