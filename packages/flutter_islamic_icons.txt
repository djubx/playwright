              // Displaying a Quran icon
              Icon(
                FlutterIslamicIcons.quran,
                size: 100.0, // Set the size of the icon

              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Add space between icons
              // Displaying a prayer mat icon
              Icon(
                FlutterIslamicIcons.prayer_mat,
                size: 100.0, // Set the size of the icon
                color: Colors.red, // Set the color of the icon
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Islamic Icons Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Column widget.
// 5. Inside the Column, three Icon widgets are displayed: mosque, quran, and prayer mat.
// 6. Each icon is given a specific size and color, and SizedBox widgets are used to add space between them.
// 7. The app showcases how to use the Islamic icons in a simple layout.
