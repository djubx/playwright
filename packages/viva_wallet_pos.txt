// 2. An AppBar is created with the title 'Viva Wallet POS Example'.
// 3. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 4. An ElevatedButton is displayed with the text 'Pay Now'.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the onPressed callback is triggered.
// 6. Inside the callback, an instance of VivaWalletPos is created.
// 7. The startPayment method is called with the amount, currency, and description.
// 8. If the payment is successful, the result is printed to the console.
// 9. If an error occurs during the payment process, it is caught and printed.
