# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the `sign_in_button` Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up and using the `sign_in_button` package in a Flutter application. We will cover platform-specific configurations for both Android and iOS.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

First, add the `sign_in_button` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  sign_in_button: ^2.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Setup

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure you have the necessary permissions and configurations in your `Info.plist` file. Add any required keys for the social platforms you plan to use.

## Step 3: Implementing the Buttons

Now, let's implement the sign-in buttons in your Flutter app. You can customize the buttons to match your app's theme.

<-- MAIN -->

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sign_in_button/sign_in_button.dart';

void main() => runApp(RealFlutter());

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sign In Button Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: SignInDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class SignInDemo extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Sign In Button Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Google Sign-In Button
            SignInButton(
              Buttons.Google,
              onPressed: () {
                // Handle Google sign-in
                print('Google sign-in pressed');
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 10),
            // Facebook Sign-In Button
            SignInButton(
              Buttons.Facebook,
              onPressed: () {
                // Handle Facebook sign-in
                print('Facebook sign-in pressed');
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 10),
            // Twitter Sign-In Button
            SignInButton(
              Buttons.Twitter,
              onPressed: () {
                // Handle Twitter sign-in
                print('Twitter sign-in pressed');
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code sets up a simple Flutter application using the `sign_in_button` package.
// It creates a main widget `RealFlutter` that initializes the app with a Material theme.
// The `SignInDemo` widget is the home screen, displaying three social media sign-in buttons.
// Each button is linked to a print statement to simulate the sign-in process.
// The buttons are styled according to their respective platforms, providing a familiar look to users.

// Application Flow:
// 1. The `main` function runs the `RealFlutter` app.
// 2. `RealFlutter` sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home screen is set to `SignInDemo`, which is a stateless widget.
// 4. `SignInDemo` builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a centered Column.
// 5. The Column contains three `SignInButton` widgets for Google, Facebook, and Twitter.
// 6. Each button has an `onPressed` callback that currently prints a message to the console.
// 7. The app is ready to be extended with actual authentication logic.
