```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:chart_it/chart_it.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Chart It Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Chart It Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: LineChart(
            data: [
              ChartData(x: 1, y: 5),
              ChartData(x: 2, y: 10),
              ChartData(x: 3, y: 15),
              ChartData(x: 4, y: 20),
              ChartData(x: 5, y: 25),
            ],
            title: 'Sample Line Chart',
            xAxisLabel: 'X Axis',
            yAxisLabel: 'Y Axis',
            lineColor: Colors.blue,
            pointColor: Colors.red,
            showGrid: true,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The above code sets up a simple Flutter application that displays a line chart.
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Chart It Example'.
// 4. In the body of the Scaffold, a LineChart widget is created with sample data.
// 5. The LineChart takes a list of ChartData objects, each representing a point on the chart.
// 6. The chart is customized with titles for the axes, colors for the line and points, and an option to show grid lines.
// 7. When the app runs, it displays a line chart with the specified data and customization options.
```
