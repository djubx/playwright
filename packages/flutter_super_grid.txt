# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `flutter_super_grid`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with `flutter_super_grid`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_super_grid: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_super_grid).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration
For iOS, you may need to set the platform version in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_super_grid/flutter_super_grid.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the SuperGrid Widget

You can now use the `SuperGrid` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
SuperGrid(
  delegate: SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount(
    crossAxisCount: 2,
    childAspectRatio: 1,
  ),
  gridDelegate: SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount(
    crossAxisCount: 2,
    childAspectRatio: 1,
  ),
  items: items, // List of items to display
  itemBuilder: (context, item) {
    return Card(
      child: Center(child: Text(item.title)),
    );
  },
)
```

This code snippet creates a simple grid with two columns, displaying a list of items.

## Step 5: Customizing the Grid

You can customize the grid further by adjusting the `childAspectRatio`, adding headers, or implementing lazy loading. Refer to the package documentation for more advanced configurations.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the `flutter_super_grid` package in your Flutter application effectively.

# Complete Example of `flutter_super_grid`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_super_grid/flutter_super_grid.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Super Grid Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Super Grid Example'),
        ),
        body: SuperGrid(
          // Setting the grid delegate to define the layout
          gridDelegate: SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount(
            crossAxisCount: 2, // Number of columns
            childAspectRatio: 1, // Aspect ratio of each item
          ),
          items: _generateItems(20), // Generating a list of items
          itemBuilder: (context, item) {
            return Card(
              // Each item is wrapped in a Card widget
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  item.title, // Displaying the title of the item
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
                ),
              ),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to generate a list of items
  List<Item> _generateItems(int count) {
    return List.generate(count, (index) => Item('Item $index'));
  }
}

// Class representing an item in the grid
class Item {
  final String title;

  Item(this.title);
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body consists of a SuperGrid widget, which displays a grid of items.
// 5. The grid is configured with a fixed number of columns and an aspect ratio.
// 6. The _generateItems function creates a list of Item objects, each with a title.
// 7. Each item is displayed in a Card widget, centered with its title.
// 8. The app runs smoothly, displaying a grid of items that can be customized further.
