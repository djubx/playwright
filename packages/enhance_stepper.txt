# Enhance Stepper Flutter Package

The `enhance_stepper` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to provide developers with a customizable and feature-rich stepper widget. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to guide users through a sequence of steps, such as onboarding processes, multi-step forms, or any workflow that requires a clear progression path.

## Features
- **Customizable Steps**: Easily define the number of steps and customize each step's content and appearance.
- **Flexible Navigation**: Supports both linear and non-linear step navigation, allowing users to skip steps if necessary.
- **State Management**: Built-in state management to track the current step and handle step transitions.
- **Theming**: Offers extensive theming options to match your application's design.

## When to Use
- **Onboarding Flows**: Guide new users through a series of introductory screens.
- **Multi-step Forms**: Break down complex forms into manageable steps.
- **Tutorials**: Provide step-by-step instructions within your app.

The `enhance_stepper` package is ideal for any application that requires a structured, step-by-step user experience.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Enhance Stepper

In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of setting up and using the `enhance_stepper` package in a Flutter application. We'll cover platform-specific details for both Android and iOS, ensuring a smooth integration.

## Setup

1. **Add Dependency**
   Add the `enhance_stepper` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     enhance_stepper: ^1.0.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**
   Run the following command to install the new package:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**
   - **Android**: Ensure your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21.
   - **iOS**: No additional configuration is required for iOS.

## Usage

To use the `enhance_stepper` package, import it into your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:enhance_stepper/enhance_stepper.dart';
```

### Basic Implementation

Create a `RealFlutter` class that extends `StatefulWidget` and implement the `EnhanceStepper` widget within it. Customize the steps and handle navigation logic as needed.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:enhance_stepper/enhance_stepper.dart';

// Main entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// Root widget of the application
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Enhance Stepper Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

// Stateful widget to manage the stepper state
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  int _currentStep = 0; // Tracks the current step index

  // List of steps to display in the stepper
  List<EnhanceStep> _steps = [
    EnhanceStep(
      title: Text('Step 1'),
      content: Text('This is the first step.'),
    ),
    EnhanceStep(
      title: Text('Step 2'),
      content: Text('This is the second step.'),
    ),
    EnhanceStep(
      title: Text('Step 3'),
      content: Text('This is the third step.'),
    ),
  ];

  // Method to handle step tapping
  void _onStepTapped(int step) {
    setState(() {
      _currentStep = step;
    });
  }

  // Method to handle step continuation
  void _onStepContinue() {
    if (_currentStep < _steps.length - 1) {
      setState(() {
        _currentStep += 1;
      });
    }
  }

  // Method to handle step cancellation
  void _onStepCancel() {
    if (_currentStep > 0) {
      setState(() {
        _currentStep -= 1;
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Enhance Stepper Example'),
      ),
      body: EnhanceStepper(
        currentStep: _currentStep,
        steps: _steps,
        onStepTapped: _onStepTapped,
        onStepContinue: _onStepContinue,
        onStepCancel: _onStepCancel,
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow:
// 1. The application starts with the `MyApp` widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. `RealFlutter` is the home widget, managing the state of the stepper.
// 3. `_RealFlutterState` maintains the current step index and defines the steps.
// 4. The `EnhanceStepper` widget is used to display the steps and handle navigation.
// 5. Users can tap on steps to navigate directly, or use continue/cancel buttons to move sequentially.
