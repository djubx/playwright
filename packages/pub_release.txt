Here's a detailed technical blog on the "pub_release" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Description

The `pub_release` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to simplify the process of managing and releasing Flutter applications. It provides developers with a streamlined way to handle versioning, changelogs, and package publishing, making it easier to maintain and distribute Flutter apps.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `pub_release` package when:
- You are preparing to release a new version of your Flutter application.
- You want to automate the process of updating version numbers and generating changelogs.
- You need to ensure that your app adheres to best practices for versioning and release management.

## Features

- **Version Management**: Automatically increment version numbers based on semantic versioning.
- **Changelog Generation**: Create changelogs from commit messages, making it easier to track changes.
- **Publishing**: Simplify the process of publishing your Flutter package to the Dart package repository.

By leveraging these features, developers can save time and reduce errors during the release process.

# Tutorial

## Setup Process

To get started with the `pub_release` package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the `pub_release` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  pub_release: ^1.0.0
```

### Step 2: Install the Package

Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android Configuration

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

#### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `ios/Podfile`.
2. Uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

### Step 4: Basic Usage

To use the `pub_release` package, you can create a new Dart file (e.g., `release_manager.dart`) and import the package:

```dart
import 'package:pub_release/pub_release.dart';

void main() {
  final releaseManager = RealFlutter();
  releaseManager.release();
}
```

This code initializes the `RealFlutter` class and calls the `release` method to handle the release process.

## Additional Configurations

You may want to customize the behavior of the `pub_release` package by providing additional configurations, such as specifying the changelog format or customizing the versioning strategy. Refer to the package documentation for more details on these options.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pub_release/pub_release.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// MyApp is the main widget of the application
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Pub Release Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: ReleaseHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

// ReleaseHomePage is the home page of the application
class ReleaseHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ReleaseHomePageState createState() => _ReleaseHomePageState();
}

class _ReleaseHomePageState extends State<ReleaseHomePage> {
  String _releaseMessage = '';

  // This method is called when the user presses the release button
  void _releaseApp() {
    final releaseManager = RealFlutter();
    // Call the release method and capture the output
    _releaseMessage = releaseManager.release();
    // Update the UI to show the release message
    setState(() {});
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Pub Release Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Release Message:',
            ),
            Text(
              _releaseMessage,
              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline4,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: _releaseApp,
        tooltip: 'Release App',
        child: Icon(Icons.publish),
      ),
    );
  }
}

/*
The application flow is as follows:
1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp with MyApp.
2. MyApp builds the MaterialApp widget, setting the title and theme.
3. The home page is set to ReleaseHomePage, which is a stateful widget.
4. In ReleaseHomePage, the _releaseApp method is defined to handle the release process.
5. When the floating action button is pressed, _releaseApp is called.
6. Inside _releaseApp, an instance of RealFlutter is created, and the release method is called.
7. The release message is captured and displayed on the screen.
8. The UI updates to show the release message after the release process is complete.
