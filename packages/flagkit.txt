# Exploring the FlagKit Flutter Package

## Overview
The **FlagKit** package is a powerful Flutter library designed to provide developers with a comprehensive set of flag icons for various countries and regions. This package is particularly useful for applications that require country selection, localization, or any feature that benefits from visual representation of flags.

## When to Use FlagKit
- **International Applications**: If your app targets a global audience and requires country selection.
- **Localization**: When you want to enhance user experience by displaying flags alongside country names.
- **Educational Apps**: For apps that teach geography or cultural information.

## Key Features
- **Wide Range of Flags**: Includes flags for over 250 countries and regions.
- **Customizable**: You can easily adjust the size and color of the flags.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that allows for quick implementation in your Flutter projects.

FlagKit is an excellent choice for developers looking to add a visual element to their applications that enhances user interaction and understanding.

# FlagKit Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To add the FlagKit package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flagkit: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run the following command to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the following in your `Info.plist` file to allow for proper rendering of images:

```xml
<key>UIAppFonts</key>
<array>
    <string>FlagKit.ttf</string>
</array>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the FlagKit package, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flagkit/flagkit.dart';
```

You can then use the `Flag` widget to display flags in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
Flag(
  country: 'US', // Country code
  size: 50,      // Size of the flag
)
```

This will render the flag of the United States at a size of 50 pixels.

# Complete Example of Using FlagKit

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flagkit/flagkit.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'FlagKit Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('FlagKit Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying the flag of the United States
              Flag(
                country: 'US', // Country code for the USA
                size: 100,     // Size of the flag
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between flags
              // Displaying the flag of Canada
              Flag(
                country: 'CA', // Country code for Canada
                size: 100,     // Size of the flag
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between flags
              // Displaying the flag of Japan
              Flag(
                country: 'JP', // Country code for Japan
                size: 100,     // Size of the flag
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'FlagKit Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Column widget.
// 5. Inside the Column, we display three flags: the USA, Canada, and Japan.
// 6. Each Flag widget is given a country code and a size, rendering the respective flags.
// 7. SizedBox widgets are used to add spacing between the flags for better visual separation.
