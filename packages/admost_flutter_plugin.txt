# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Admost Flutter Plugin

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **admost_flutter_plugin** and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Installation

To add the **admost_flutter_plugin** to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  admost_flutter_plugin: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/admost_flutter_plugin).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the necessary permissions and metadata for AdMost:

```xml
<manifest>
    <application>
        <meta-data
            android:name="admost_app_id"
            android:value="YOUR_ADMOST_APP_ID" />
    </application>
</manifest>
```

Replace `YOUR_ADMOST_APP_ID` with your actual AdMost application ID.

### iOS Configuration
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys:

```xml
<key>AdMostAppId</key>
<string>YOUR_ADMOST_APP_ID</string>
```

Again, replace `YOUR_ADMOST_APP_ID` with your actual AdMost application ID.

## Step 3: Using the Plugin

Now that we have set up the plugin, we can start using it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to initialize and display a banner ad.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:admost_flutter_plugin/admost_flutter_plugin.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize AdMost SDK
    AdMost.initialize("YOUR_ADMOST_APP_ID");
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("AdMost Example")),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text("Welcome to AdMost Example"),
            // Displaying a banner ad
            AdMostBanner(
              adUnitId: "YOUR_BANNER_AD_UNIT_ID",
              listener: (AdMostBannerEvent event) {
                // Handle banner ad events
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize the AdMost SDK in the `initState` method and display a banner ad in the center of the screen.

# Complete Example: AdMost Flutter Plugin in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:admost_flutter_plugin/admost_flutter_plugin.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize AdMost SDK with your App ID
    AdMost.initialize("YOUR_ADMOST_APP_ID");
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("AdMost Example")),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text("Welcome to AdMost Example"),
            // Displaying a banner ad
            AdMostBanner(
              adUnitId: "YOUR_BANNER_AD_UNIT_ID", // Replace with your banner ad unit ID
              listener: (AdMostBannerEvent event) {
                // Handle banner ad events
                switch (event) {
                  case AdMostBannerEvent.loaded:
                    print("Banner loaded");
                    break;
                  case AdMostBannerEvent.failedToLoad:
                    print("Banner failed to load");
                    break;
                  // Handle other events as needed
                }
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the initState method, we initialize the AdMost SDK with our App ID.
// 3. The build method creates a simple UI with a welcome message and a banner ad.
// 4. The AdMostBanner widget is used to display the banner ad, and we provide an ad unit ID.
// 5. We set up a listener to handle ad events, such as when the ad is loaded or fails to load.
// 6. The app will display the banner ad in the center of the screen, allowing users to interact with it.
```
