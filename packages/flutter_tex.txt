# Flutter_tex: A Comprehensive Guide

## Overview
The `flutter_tex` package is a powerful tool for rendering LaTeX equations and mathematical expressions in Flutter applications. It allows developers to display complex mathematical notations seamlessly, making it an excellent choice for educational apps, scientific applications, or any app that requires mathematical representation.

### When to Use `flutter_tex`
- **Educational Apps**: Ideal for apps that teach mathematics or physics, where equations are frequently displayed.
- **Scientific Applications**: Useful in applications that require the display of scientific formulas or notations.
- **Dynamic Content**: When you need to render LaTeX content dynamically from user input or external sources.

### Features
- **Rich Text Rendering**: Supports a wide range of LaTeX commands and symbols.
- **Customizable**: Allows customization of text styles and sizes.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on both Android and iOS, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient rendering of LaTeX content, minimizing performance overhead.

## Example Use Cases
- Displaying mathematical equations in a tutoring app.
- Showing scientific formulas in a research application.
- Allowing users to input and render their own LaTeX equations in a note-taking app.

## Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `flutter_tex`

### Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `flutter_tex` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_tex: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_tex).

### Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android Configuration
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

#### iOS Configuration
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following permissions to allow the app to access the internet (if needed):

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

### Step 3: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_tex/flutter_tex.dart';
```

### Step 4: Using `flutter_tex` in Your Widget
You can now use the `TeXView` widget to render LaTeX content. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
TeXView(
  child: TeXViewDocument(r"""
    \text{This is a simple equation: } E = mc^2
  """),
)
```

### Step 5: Customizing the TeXView
You can customize the appearance of the rendered text by using properties like `style` and `textAlign`. For example:

```dart
TeXView(
  child: TeXViewDocument(r"""
    \text{This is a styled equation: } E = mc^2
  """),
  style: TeXViewStyle(
    textAlign: TeXViewTextAlign.center,
    fontSize: 20,
    color: Colors.blue,
  ),
)
```

### Conclusion
With these steps, you can easily integrate the `flutter_tex` package into your Flutter application and start rendering LaTeX equations.

## Complete Example: Flutter Application Using `flutter_tex`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart'; // Importing Flutter material package
import 'package:flutter_tex/flutter_tex.dart'; // Importing the flutter_tex package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the RealFlutter app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter TeX Example', // Title of the application
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter TeX Example'), // AppBar title
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: TeXView( // Using TeXView to render LaTeX content
            child: TeXViewDocument(r"""
              \text{Here is a famous equation: } E = mc^2
            """),
            style: TeXViewStyle(
              textAlign: TeXViewTextAlign.center, // Centering the text
              fontSize: 24, // Setting font size
              color: Colors.black, // Setting text color
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Flutter TeX Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers a TeXView widget.
// 5. The TeXView widget renders a LaTeX document displaying the equation E = mc^2.
// 6. The text is styled to be centered, with a font size of 24 and black color.
```
