Here's a detailed technical blog on the "sized_context" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Sized Context Flutter Package

The `sized_context` package in Flutter is a powerful tool that allows developers to obtain the size of the context in which a widget is rendered. This can be particularly useful when you need to make layout decisions based on the available space, such as when creating responsive designs or when you want to adapt your UI based on the screen size.

## When to Use `sized_context`

You might consider using the `sized_context` package in scenarios such as:

- **Responsive Design**: When building applications that need to adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.
- **Dynamic Layouts**: When the layout of your widgets depends on the size of their parent or surrounding widgets.
- **Custom Widgets**: When creating reusable widgets that need to know their size to render correctly.

## Features

- **Context Size Retrieval**: Easily retrieve the width and height of the current context.
- **Responsive Widgets**: Create widgets that can adjust their size and layout based on the available space.
- **Simplicity**: The API is straightforward and easy to integrate into existing Flutter applications.

Overall, the `sized_context` package enhances the flexibility of your Flutter applications by providing a simple way to access context sizes, making it easier to create responsive and adaptive UIs.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Sized Context

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `sized_context` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  sized_context: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the platform version in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using Sized Context

To use the `sized_context` package, you can wrap your widget with `SizedContext` and access the size using the provided methods. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sized_context/sized_context.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Sized Context Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: SizedBox(
            width: context.widthPct(0.5), // 50% of the available width
            height: context.heightPct(0.3), // 30% of the available height
            child: Container(
              color: Colors.blue,
              child: Center(child: Text('Hello, Sized Context!')),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we use `context.widthPct` and `context.heightPct` to set the size of a `Container` based on the available screen size.

# Complete Example of Sized Context

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sized_context/sized_context.dart';

// Main application class
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Sized Context Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Using SizedBox to control the size of the child widget
          child: SizedBox(
            // Setting width to 50% of the available width
            width: context.widthPct(0.5),
            // Setting height to 30% of the available height
            height: context.heightPct(0.3),
            child: Container(
              color: Colors.blue, // Background color of the container
              child: Center(
                // Centering the text inside the container
                child: Text(
                  'Hello, Sized Context!',
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
3. Inside the Center widget, a SizedBox is created, which uses the SizedContext package to set its width to 50% and height to 30% of the available screen size.
4. The SizedBox contains a Container with a blue background and centered text saying "Hello, Sized Context!".
5. The text is styled to be white and larger for better visibility.
6. The layout is responsive, adapting to different screen sizes based on the context size provided by the sized_context package.
