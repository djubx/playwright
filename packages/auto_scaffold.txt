# Overview of the auto_scaffold Flutter Package

The `auto_scaffold` package is a powerful tool designed to simplify the process of creating scaffolded Flutter applications. It provides a streamlined way to manage common UI elements such as app bars, bottom navigation bars, and floating action buttons, allowing developers to focus on building their app's core functionality without getting bogged down in repetitive UI code.

## When to Use `auto_scaffold`

You might consider using `auto_scaffold` in scenarios such as:
- When you want to quickly set up a new Flutter project with a consistent UI structure.
- If you are building applications that require multiple screens with similar layouts.
- When you want to reduce boilerplate code related to scaffolding in Flutter.

## Key Features
- **Automatic Scaffold Generation**: Automatically generates a scaffold for your application, including app bars and bottom navigation.
- **Customizable UI Elements**: Easily customize the appearance and behavior of the scaffolded components.
- **State Management Integration**: Works seamlessly with popular state management solutions like Provider and Riverpod.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes and orientations, ensuring a consistent user experience.

Overall, `auto_scaffold` is an excellent choice for developers looking to enhance productivity and maintain a clean codebase in their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using auto_scaffold

## Installation

To get started with `auto_scaffold`, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  auto_scaffold: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version of the package. After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using auto_scaffold

To use `auto_scaffold`, you can create a new class that extends `RealFlutter`, which is the main class provided by the package. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set it up:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:auto_scaffold/auto_scaffold.dart';

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return RealFlutter(
      title: 'My Auto Scaffold App',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Welcome to auto_scaffold!')),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          // Action for the button
        },
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple app with a home screen that includes an app bar and a floating action button. The `RealFlutter` class takes care of the scaffold setup, allowing you to focus on the content of your screens.

Now, you can run your application using:

```bash
flutter run
```

This will launch your app with the scaffolded layout provided by `auto_scaffold`.

# Complete Example of auto_scaffold in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:auto_scaffold/auto_scaffold.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // The main entry point of the application
    return RealFlutter(
      title: 'My Auto Scaffold App',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Building the home screen with a scaffold
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home'), // Title of the app bar
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Welcome to auto_scaffold!'), // Welcome message
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Spacing
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action for the button
                Navigator.push(
                  context,
                  MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => SecondScreen()),
                );
              },
              child: Text('Go to Second Screen'), // Button to navigate
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          // Action for the floating action button
        },
        child: Icon(Icons.add), // Icon for the button
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SecondScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Building the second screen
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Second Screen'), // Title of the second screen
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('This is the second screen!'), // Message for the second screen
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp class, which initializes the RealFlutter scaffold.
// 2. The HomeScreen is displayed, featuring an AppBar, a welcome message, and a button.
// 3. When the button is pressed, it navigates to the SecondScreen using the Navigator.
// 4. The SecondScreen has its own AppBar and displays a simple message.
