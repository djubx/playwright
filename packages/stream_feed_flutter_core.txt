# Stream Feed Flutter Core: A Comprehensive Overview

The `stream_feed_flutter_core` package is a powerful tool for integrating Stream's activity feed service into Flutter applications. It allows developers to build real-time feeds, notifications, and activity streams with ease. This package is particularly useful for applications that require social features, such as news feeds, notifications, or user activity tracking.

# Setting Up and Using Stream Feed Flutter Core

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `stream_feed_flutter_core` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Installation

To get started, add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  stream_feed_flutter_core: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/stream_feed_flutter_core).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions for network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage

1. **Initialize the Stream Client**: You need to create a Stream client using your API key and secret.
2. **Create a Feed**: Define the feed you want to display.
3. **Use the Feed Widget**: Utilize the provided widgets to display the feed in your application.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set up the Stream client and display a feed:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:stream_feed_flutter_core/stream_feed_flutter_core.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Stream Feed Example',
      home: FeedScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class FeedScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Initialize the Stream client with your API key
    final client = StreamFeedClient(apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY');

    // Create a feed for the user
    final feed = client.flatFeed('user', '1');

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Activity Feed')),
      body: FeedBuilder(
        feed: feed,
        builder: (context, feedState) {
          if (feedState.isLoading) {
            return Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
          }
          return ListView.builder(
            itemCount: feedState.articles.length,
            itemBuilder: (context, index) {
              final article = feedState.articles[index];
              return ListTile(
                title: Text(article.title),
                subtitle: Text(article.body),
              );
            },
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code initializes the Stream client, creates a user feed, and displays the articles in a list. 

Make sure to replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your actual Stream API key.

# Complete Example of Stream Feed Flutter Core

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:stream_feed_flutter_core/stream_feed_flutter_core.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Stream Feed Example',
      home: FeedScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class FeedScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Initialize the Stream client with your API key
    final client = StreamFeedClient(apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY');

    // Create a feed for the user
    final feed = client.flatFeed('user', '1');

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Activity Feed')),
      body: FeedBuilder(
        feed: feed,
        builder: (context, feedState) {
          // Check if the feed is loading
          if (feedState.isLoading) {
            return Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
          }
          // Display the list of articles
          return ListView.builder(
            itemCount: feedState.articles.length,
            itemBuilder: (context, index) {
              final article = feedState.articles[index];
              return ListTile(
                title: Text(article.title), // Display article title
                subtitle: Text(article.body), // Display article body
              );
            },
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home FeedScreen.
// 3. FeedScreen initializes the Stream client with the API key.
// 4. It creates a flat feed for a user with ID '1'.
// 5. The FeedBuilder widget listens to the feed and provides the current state.
// 6. If the feed is loading, a CircularProgressIndicator is shown.
// 7. Once loaded, it displays a ListView of articles from the feed.
// 8. Each article is represented by a ListTile showing its title and body.
