class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Lean File Picker Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {

  List<File> _selectedFiles = [];

  void _pickFiles() async {
    // Call the pickFiles method to display the file picker

    setState(() {

  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Lean File Picker Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _pickFiles,
              child: Text('Pick Files'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text('Selected Files:'),
            SizedBox(height: 10),
            _selectedFiles.isEmpty
                ? Text('No files selected')
                : Column(
                    children: _selectedFiles.map((file) {
                      return Text(file.path);
                    }).toList(),
                  ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user clicks the "Pick Files" button, which calls the _pickFiles method.
// 2. The _pickFiles method calls the pickFiles method of the LeanFilePicker instance.
// 3. The pickFiles method displays the file picker, allowing the user to select files.
// 4. Once the user selects files, the pickFiles method returns a list of File objects.
// 5. The _pickFiles method handles the selected files by updating the _selectedFiles state.
// 6. The UI is updated to display the selected files.

// This code demonstrates the basic usage of the lean_file_picker package.
// It allows the user to select files and displays the selected files in the UI.
