Here's a detailed technical blog on the "functional_status_codes" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Functional Status Codes Flutter Package

The **functional_status_codes** package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that provides a standardized way to handle various status codes in applications. This package is particularly useful when dealing with APIs, as it allows developers to manage responses effectively and implement error handling in a more structured manner.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the **functional_status_codes** package in scenarios such as:

- **API Integration**: When your Flutter application interacts with RESTful APIs, this package helps in managing the different HTTP status codes returned by the server.
- **Error Handling**: It simplifies the process of handling errors by providing a clear mapping of status codes to user-friendly messages or actions.
- **State Management**: If your application requires different states based on the status of operations (like loading, success, or error), this package can streamline that process.

## Features

- **Standardized Status Codes**: Provides a set of common status codes that can be easily referenced.
- **Custom Error Handling**: Allows developers to define custom messages or actions for specific status codes.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate into existing Flutter applications with minimal setup.

By leveraging the **functional_status_codes** package, developers can enhance the robustness and maintainability of their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Functional Status Codes Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **functional_status_codes** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  functional_status_codes: ^1.0.0
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` file to include any necessary permissions or configurations based on your app's requirements.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have the package installed, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:functional_status_codes/functional_status_codes.dart';
```

2. Use the `RealFlutter` class to handle status codes:

```dart
class RealFlutter {
  void handleResponse(int statusCode) {
    switch (statusCode) {
      case StatusCodes.ok:
        print("Request was successful!");
        break;
      case StatusCodes.notFound:
        print("Resource not found.");
        break;
      case StatusCodes.internalServerError:
        print("Server error occurred.");
        break;
      default:
        print("Unhandled status code: $statusCode");
    }
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to handle different HTTP status codes using the **functional_status_codes** package.

# Complete Example of Using Functional Status Codes

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:functional_status_codes/functional_status_codes.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Functional Status Codes Demo',
      home: StatusCodeDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class StatusCodeDemo extends StatelessWidget {
  // Instance of RealFlutter to handle status codes
  final RealFlutter realFlutter = RealFlutter();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Status Code Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Simulating an API call with a status code
            int simulatedStatusCode = StatusCodes.ok; // Change this to test different codes
            realFlutter.handleResponse(simulatedStatusCode);
          },
          child: Text('Simulate API Call'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter {
  // Method to handle different status codes
  void handleResponse(int statusCode) {
    switch (statusCode) {
      case StatusCodes.ok:
        print("Request was successful!"); // Handle success
        break;
      case StatusCodes.notFound:
        print("Resource not found."); // Handle not found
        break;
      case StatusCodes.internalServerError:
        print("Server error occurred."); // Handle server error
        break;
      default:
        print("Unhandled status code: $statusCode"); // Handle unknown status codes
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget, StatusCodeDemo.
// 3. StatusCodeDemo contains a button that simulates an API call when pressed.
// 4. Upon pressing the button, a simulated status code is passed to the handleResponse method of the RealFlutter class.
// 5. The handleResponse method checks the status code and prints the corresponding message to the console.
```
