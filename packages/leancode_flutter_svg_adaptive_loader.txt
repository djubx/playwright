# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using leancode_flutter_svg_adaptive_loader

## Installation
To get started with the `leancode_flutter_svg_adaptive_loader` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  leancode_flutter_svg_adaptive_loader: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/leancode_flutter_svg_adaptive_loader).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable the use of SVG images in your project. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>fetch</string>
</array>
```

## Using the Package
Once the package is installed and configured, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to load an SVG image adaptively.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:leancode_flutter_svg_adaptive_loader/leancode_flutter_svg_adaptive_loader.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('SVG Adaptive Loader Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: AdaptiveSvgLoader(
            assetPath: 'assets/images/example.svg', // Path to your SVG file
            width: 200, // Desired width
            height: 200, // Desired height
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that uses the `AdaptiveSvgLoader` widget to load an SVG image. The `assetPath` parameter specifies the location of the SVG file, while `width` and `height` define the dimensions of the image.

# Complete Example of leancode_flutter_svg_adaptive_loader

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:leancode_flutter_svg_adaptive_loader/leancode_flutter_svg_adaptive_loader.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('SVG Adaptive Loader Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Using AdaptiveSvgLoader to load an SVG image
          child: AdaptiveSvgLoader(
            assetPath: 'assets/images/example.svg', // Path to your SVG file
            width: 200, // Desired width
            height: 200, // Desired height
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the main UI.
// 3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// 4. The AppBar displays the title of the application.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 6. The AdaptiveSvgLoader widget is used to load an SVG image from the specified asset path.
// 7. The width and height parameters define the size of the SVG image.
// 8. When the app runs, it will display the SVG image adaptively based on the device's screen size.
