# Setting Up and Using the toss_payment Package

## Installation
To get started with the `toss_payment` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  toss_payment: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/toss_payment).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Add the necessary permissions and metadata in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<manifest>
    <application>
        <meta-data
            android:name="toss_payment_key"
            android:value="YOUR_TOSS_PAYMENT_KEY" />
    </application>
</manifest>
```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure your `build.gradle` file includes the required dependencies.

### iOS
1. **Update Info.plist**: Add the Toss payment key in your `Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>toss_payment_key</key>
<string>YOUR_TOSS_PAYMENT_KEY</string>
```

2. **CocoaPods**: Make sure to run `pod install` in the `ios` directory after adding the package.

## Basic Usage
Once the package is installed and configured, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initiate a payment:

```dart
import 'package:toss_payment/toss_payment.dart';

void initiatePayment() {
  final tossPayment = TossPayment();
  tossPayment.requestPayment(
    amount: 10000, // Amount in the smallest currency unit (e.g., cents)
    orderId: 'order_12345',
    successUrl: 'https://yourapp.com/success',
    failUrl: 'https://yourapp.com/fail',
  );
}
```

This function initiates a payment request with the specified amount and order ID, along with success and failure URLs.

# Complete Example of Using toss_payment

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:toss_payment/toss_payment.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Toss Payment Example',
      home: PaymentScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PaymentScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  // Create an instance of TossPayment
  final TossPayment tossPayment = TossPayment();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Toss Payment Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Initiate the payment process when the button is pressed
            initiatePayment();
          },
          child: Text('Pay Now'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void initiatePayment() {
    // Request payment with the TossPayment instance
    tossPayment.requestPayment(
      amount: 10000, // Amount in the smallest currency unit (e.g., cents)
      orderId: 'order_12345',
      successUrl: 'https://yourapp.com/success',
      failUrl: 'https://yourapp.com/fail',
    ).then((result) {
      // Handle the payment result
      if (result.isSuccess) {
        // Payment was successful
        print('Payment Successful: ${result.transactionId}');
      } else {
        // Payment failed
        print('Payment Failed: ${result.errorMessage}');
      }
    });
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and displays a button labeled "Pay Now".
// 2. When the button is pressed, the initiatePayment function is called.
// 3. This function requests a payment through the TossPayment instance.
// 4. The payment request includes the amount, order ID, and URLs for success and failure.
// 5. The result of the payment request is handled in a callback.
// 6. If the payment is successful, the transaction ID is printed; otherwise, the error message is displayed.
