# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Smooth Highlight Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **smooth_highlight** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  smooth_highlight: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the smooth highlight effect on a button.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:smooth_highlight/smooth_highlight.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Smooth Highlight Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: SmoothHighlight(
            onTap: () {
              // Action on tap
              print('Button tapped!');
            },
            highlightColor: Colors.blue.withOpacity(0.5),
            child: Container(
              padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
              decoration: BoxDecoration(
                color: Colors.blue,
                borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(10),
              ),
              child: Text(
                'Tap Me!',
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app with a button that uses the **smooth_highlight** package to provide a highlight effect when tapped.

# Complete Example of Smooth Highlight in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:smooth_highlight/smooth_highlight.dart';

// Main class of the application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Smooth Highlight Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: SmoothHighlight(
            onTap: () {
              // Action on tap
              print('Button tapped!'); // Log the tap action
            },
            highlightColor: Colors.blue.withOpacity(0.5), // Set highlight color
            child: Container(
              padding: EdgeInsets.all(20), // Padding around the text
              decoration: BoxDecoration(
                color: Colors.blue, // Background color of the button
                borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(10), // Rounded corners
              ),
              child: Text(
                'Tap Me!', // Text displayed on the button
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20), // Text style
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
3. Inside the Center widget, a SmoothHighlight widget wraps a Container that acts as a button.
4. The SmoothHighlight widget listens for tap events and triggers the onTap callback when the button is tapped.
5. The highlightColor property defines the color of the highlight effect, which appears when the button is pressed.
6. The Container has padding, a background color, and rounded corners, making it visually appealing.
7. When the button is tapped, a message is printed to the console, demonstrating the interaction.
