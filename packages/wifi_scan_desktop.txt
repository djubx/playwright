# Overview of the wifi_scan_desktop Flutter Package

The `wifi_scan_desktop` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to integrate Wi-Fi scanning capabilities into their desktop applications. This package allows you to scan for available Wi-Fi networks, providing essential information such as SSID, signal strength, and security type. 

## When to Use This Package
You might consider using `wifi_scan_desktop` in scenarios such as:
- Building a network management tool that requires users to view available Wi-Fi networks.
- Creating a Wi-Fi connection manager that helps users connect to different networks.
- Developing applications that need to display network information for troubleshooting purposes.

## Key Features
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Real-Time Scanning**: Provides real-time updates of available Wi-Fi networks.
- **Detailed Network Information**: Retrieves SSID, BSSID, signal strength, and security type for each network.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that allows for quick implementation in your Flutter applications.

With these features, `wifi_scan_desktop` is an excellent choice for developers looking to enhance their desktop applications with Wi-Fi scanning capabilities.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using wifi_scan_desktop

## Installation
To get started with the `wifi_scan_desktop` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  wifi_scan_desktop: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/wifi_scan_desktop).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### For Windows
1. Ensure that your Flutter environment is set up for Windows development.
2. You may need to enable the necessary permissions in your app's manifest file to allow network scanning.

### For macOS
1. Open your `macos/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following key to request permission for network access:
   ```xml
   <key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
   <string>This app requires access to Wi-Fi networks.</string>
   ```

### For Linux
1. Ensure that your application has the necessary permissions to access network information.
2. You may need to install additional libraries depending on your Linux distribution.

## Using the Package
Once you have installed the package and configured your platform, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to scan for Wi-Fi networks:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:wifi_scan_desktop/wifi_scan_desktop.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  List<WifiNetwork> networks = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _scanWifiNetworks();
  }

  Future<void> _scanWifiNetworks() async {
    List<WifiNetwork> scannedNetworks = await WifiScanDesktop.scan();
    setState(() {
      networks = scannedNetworks;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Wi-Fi Scanner')),
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: networks.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return ListTile(
            title: Text(networks[index].ssid),
            subtitle: Text('Signal Strength: ${networks[index].signalStrength} dBm'),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code initializes the Wi-Fi scanning process when the app starts and displays the available networks in a list.

# Complete Example of Using wifi_scan_desktop

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:wifi_scan_desktop/wifi_scan_desktop.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // List to hold the scanned Wi-Fi networks
  List<WifiNetwork> networks = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Start scanning for Wi-Fi networks when the app initializes
    _scanWifiNetworks();
  }

  // Function to scan for Wi-Fi networks
  Future<void> _scanWifiNetworks() async {
    // Call the scan method from the wifi_scan_desktop package
    List<WifiNetwork> scannedNetworks = await WifiScanDesktop.scan();
    // Update the state with the scanned networks
    setState(() {
      networks = scannedNetworks;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Wi-Fi Scanner')),
      body: ListView.builder(
        // Build a list view to display the scanned networks
        itemCount: networks.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return ListTile(
            // Display the SSID of the network
            title: Text(networks[index].ssid),
            // Display the signal strength of the network
            subtitle: Text('Signal Strength: ${networks[index].signalStrength} dBm'),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and the RealFlutter widget is created.
// 2. In the initState method, the _scanWifiNetworks function is called to initiate the scanning process.
// 3. The _scanWifiNetworks function uses the WifiScanDesktop.scan() method to retrieve a list of available Wi-Fi networks.
// 4. The state is updated with the scanned networks, triggering a rebuild of the widget.
// 5. The build method constructs a ListView that displays each network's SSID and signal strength.
// 6. As the user interacts with the app, they can see the available Wi-Fi networks in real-time.
