# Complete Example of Animated Music Indicator

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_music_indicator/animated_music_indicator.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animated Music Indicator Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MusicIndicatorScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class MusicIndicatorScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MusicIndicatorScreenState createState() => _MusicIndicatorScreenState();
}

class _MusicIndicatorScreenState extends State<MusicIndicatorScreen> {
  // This variable will control the playback state
  bool isPlaying = false;

  // This method simulates audio playback
  void togglePlayback() {
    setState(() {
      isPlaying = !isPlaying; // Toggle the playback state
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Animated Music Indicator'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Animated Music Indicator widget
            AnimatedMusicIndicator(
              isPlaying: isPlaying, // Pass the playback state
              height: 200, // Set the height of the indicator
              width: 200, // Set the width of the indicator
              color: Colors.blue, // Set the color of the indicator
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: togglePlayback, // Toggle playback on button press
              child: Text(isPlaying ? 'Pause' : 'Play'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application using the Animated Music Indicator package.
// 
// 1. **Main Function**: The `main` function initializes the app by running the `RealFlutter` widget.
// 2. **RealFlutter Class**: This is the main widget of the application, setting up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. **MusicIndicatorScreen Class**: This stateful widget manages the playback state and UI.
// 4. **State Management**: The `isPlaying` boolean variable tracks whether the music is playing or paused.
// 5. **togglePlayback Method**: This method toggles the `isPlaying` state when the button is pressed.
// 6. **UI Layout**: The UI consists of an `AnimatedMusicIndicator` that visually represents the playback state and a button to control playback.
// 7. **AnimatedMusicIndicator**: This widget takes the `isPlaying` state and displays an animated indicator accordingly.
// 8. **Button**: The button text changes based on the playback state, allowing users to play or pause the music.

// In summary, this application demonstrates how to integrate the `animated_music_indicator` package into a Flutter app, providing a visual representation of audio playback. The user can toggle playback using a button, which updates the animated indicator in real-time.
