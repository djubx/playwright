# Lazy Load ScrollView Flutter Package

The `lazy_load_scrollview` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to implement lazy loading in their applications. Lazy loading is a design pattern that postpones the loading of resources until they are needed, which can significantly improve performance and user experience, especially in applications that display large lists of data.

## When to Use

You should consider using the `lazy_load_scrollview` package when:
- You have a long list of items that need to be displayed, such as in a feed or a gallery.
- You want to improve the performance of your app by loading data incrementally rather than all at once.
- You need to implement infinite scrolling, where more data is fetched as the user scrolls down.

## Features

- **Infinite Scrolling**: Automatically loads more items as the user scrolls down.
- **Customizable**: Allows for customization of loading indicators and other UI elements.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate with existing Flutter applications.

The package is particularly useful for applications that require dynamic data loading, such as social media feeds, product listings, or any scenario where data is fetched from a remote source.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Lazy Load ScrollView

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `lazy_load_scrollview` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  lazy_load_scrollview: ^2.0.0
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have the package installed, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement lazy loading with a list of items.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:lazy_load_scrollview/lazy_load_scrollview.dart';
```

2. Create a stateful widget that will use the `LazyLoadScrollView`:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  List<int> items = List.generate(20, (index) => index); // Initial items
  int page = 0; // Current page

  void loadMore() {
    // Simulate a network call
    Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2), () {
      setState(() {
        items.addAll(List.generate(20, (index) => index + items.length)); // Load more items
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Lazy Load ScrollView Example')),
      body: LazyLoadScrollView(
        onEndOfPage: loadMore, // Load more items when reaching the end
        child: ListView.builder(
          itemCount: items.length,
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            return ListTile(title: Text('Item ${items[index]}'));
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Run your application to see the lazy loading in action!

# Complete Example of Lazy Load ScrollView

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:lazy_load_scrollview/lazy_load_scrollview.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Lazy Load ScrollView Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  List<int> items = List.generate(20, (index) => index); // Initial items
  int page = 0; // Current page

  void loadMore() {
    // Simulate a network call
    Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2), () {
      setState(() {
        items.addAll(List.generate(20, (index) => index + items.length)); // Load more items
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Lazy Load ScrollView Example')),
      body: LazyLoadScrollView(
        onEndOfPage: loadMore, // Load more items when reaching the end
        child: ListView.builder(
          itemCount: items.length,
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            return ListTile(title: Text('Item ${items[index]}')); // Display each item
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp and points to the RealFlutter widget as the home.
// 3. RealFlutter is a stateful widget that initializes a list of items and a page counter.
// 4. The loadMore function simulates a network call to fetch more items when the user scrolls to the end of the list.
// 5. The LazyLoadScrollView widget wraps a ListView.builder, which displays the items.
// 6. When the user scrolls to the bottom, the onEndOfPage callback triggers loadMore, adding more items to the list.
// 7. The UI updates automatically as new items are added, providing a seamless lazy loading experience.
