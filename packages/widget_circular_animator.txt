## Setup Process

To get started with the `widget_circular_animator` package, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     widget_circular_animator: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
   ```

2. **Install the Package**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

     ```groovy
     android {
         ...
         defaultConfig {
             ...
             minSdkVersion 21
         }
     }
     ```

   - **iOS**: Open `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode and ensure that your deployment target is set to at least iOS 10.0.

4. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the package:

   ```dart
   import 'package:widget_circular_animator/widget_circular_animator.dart';
   ```

## Using the Package

To use the `widget_circular_animator`, you can create a simple circular animation widget as follows:

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return CircularAnimator(
    duration: Duration(seconds: 2),
    color: Colors.blue,
    size: 100.0,
    child: Icon(Icons.refresh, color: Colors.white),
  );
}
```

### Key Parameters:
- `duration`: The duration of the animation.
- `color`: The color of the circular animation.
- `size`: The size of the circular widget.
- `child`: The widget to display inside the circular animator.

This setup will create a circular animation that lasts for 2 seconds, with a blue color and an icon in the center.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:widget_circular_animator/widget_circular_animator.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Circular Animator Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Circular Animator Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          // Centering the Circular Animator in the middle of the screen
          child: CircularAnimator(
            duration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Animation duration
            color: Colors.blue, // Color of the circular animation
            size: 100.0, // Size of the circular widget
            child: Icon(Icons.refresh, color: Colors.white), // Child widget
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Circular Animator Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers a CircularAnimator widget.
// 5. The CircularAnimator is configured with a 2-second duration, blue color, and a size of 100.0.
// 6. Inside the CircularAnimator, an Icon widget is displayed, which will be animated within the circular area.
```
