# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Direct Select Flutter

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started with `direct_select_flutter`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  direct_select_flutter: ^0.3.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:direct_select_flutter/direct_select_flutter.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Direct Select Widget
You can now use the `DirectSelect` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
DirectSelect(
  itemExtent: 50.0,
  selectedItemBuilder: (context, value) {
    return Text(
      value,
      style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
    );
  },
  items: [
    DirectSelectItem<String>(
      item: 'Option 1',
      value: 'Option 1',
    ),
    DirectSelectItem<String>(
      item: 'Option 2',
      value: 'Option 2',
    ),
    DirectSelectItem<String>(
      item: 'Option 3',
      value: 'Option 3',
    ),
  ],
  onSelectedItemChanged: (value) {
    print('Selected: $value');
  },
)
```

This code snippet creates a simple direct selection interface with three options. The selected item is printed to the console when changed.

# Complete Example of Direct Select Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:direct_select_flutter/direct_select_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Direct Select Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Direct Select Flutter Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: DirectSelectExample(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DirectSelectExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DirectSelectExampleState createState() => _DirectSelectExampleState();
}

class _DirectSelectExampleState extends State<DirectSelectExample> {
  // Variable to hold the selected item
  String selectedItem = 'Option 1';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        // Display the currently selected item
        Text(
          'Selected: $selectedItem',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20),
        // DirectSelect widget for item selection
        DirectSelect<String>(
          itemExtent: 50.0,
          selectedItemBuilder: (context, value) {
            return Text(
              value,
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
            );
          },
          items: [
            DirectSelectItem<String>(
              item: 'Option 1',
              value: 'Option 1',
            ),
            DirectSelectItem<String>(
              item: 'Option 2',
              value: 'Option 2',
            ),
            DirectSelectItem<String>(
              item: 'Option 3',
              value: 'Option 3',
            ),
          ],
          onSelectedItemChanged: (value) {
            // Update the selected item and refresh the UI
            setState(() {
              selectedItem = value;
            });
            print('Selected: $value'); // Log the selected value
          },
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets MyApp as the home widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and the DirectSelectExample widget.
// 3. DirectSelectExample is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the selected item.
// 4. The build method displays the currently selected item and the DirectSelect widget.
// 5. When an item is selected, the onSelectedItemChanged callback updates the selectedItem state and refreshes the UI.
