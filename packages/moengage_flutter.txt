# Tutorial: Setting Up MoEngage in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **moengage_flutter** package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the **moengage_flutter** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  moengage_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions and services:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED"/>

<application>
    ...
    <meta-data
        android:name="moengage_app_id"
        android:value="YOUR_MOENGAGE_APP_ID"/>
    <service android:name="com.moengage.push.PushNotificationService" android:exported="true"/>
    <receiver android:name="com.moengage.push.PushNotificationReceiver" android:exported="true"/>
</application>
```

2. **Add MoEngage SDK**: Ensure you have the MoEngage SDK integrated into your project. Follow the official MoEngage documentation for detailed steps.

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
<key>moengage_app_id</key>
<string>YOUR_MOENGAGE_APP_ID</string>
```

2. **Enable Push Notifications**: In Xcode, enable push notifications for your app under the Capabilities tab.

## Step 3: Initialize MoEngage

In your main Dart file, initialize MoEngage in the `main()` function:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:moengage_flutter/moengage_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  MoEngageFlutter.initialize("YOUR_MOENGAGE_APP_ID");
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 4: Using MoEngage Features

You can now use various features of MoEngage in your app. For example, to track an event:

```dart
MoEngageFlutter.trackEvent("Event_Name", {"key": "value"});
```

This will help you track user interactions and gather analytics.

# Complete Example of MoEngage in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:moengage_flutter/moengage_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  // Ensure Flutter bindings are initialized
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  
  // Initialize MoEngage with your app ID
  MoEngageFlutter.initialize("YOUR_MOENGAGE_APP_ID");
  
  // Run the Flutter application
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'MoEngage Flutter Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('MoEngage Flutter Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Track a custom event when the button is pressed
            MoEngageFlutter.trackEvent("Button_Clicked", {"button": "Demo Button"});
            // Show a snackbar to confirm the event tracking
            ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
              SnackBar(content: Text('Event Tracked!')),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Track Event'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app and MoEngage with the provided app ID.
// 2. The MyApp class sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The HomeScreen class builds the main UI with an AppBar and a button.
// 4. When the button is pressed, it tracks a custom event using MoEngage and shows a snackbar to confirm the action.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we have created a simple Flutter application that integrates the MoEngage package. The application initializes MoEngage, sets up a basic UI with a button, and tracks an event when the button is pressed. 

### Summary of Application Flow
- The application starts by initializing the MoEngage SDK with the app ID.
- The main UI consists of a button that, when clicked, triggers an event tracking call to MoEngage.
- A snackbar is displayed to inform the user that the event has been successfully tracked.
