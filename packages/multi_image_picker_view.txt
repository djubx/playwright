# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Multi Image Picker View

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `multi_image_picker_view` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `multi_image_picker_view` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  multi_image_picker_view: ^<latest_version>
```

Make sure to replace `<latest_version>` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/multi_image_picker_view).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    compileSdkVersion 31 // or latest version
    ...
}

dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'com.android.support:multidex:1.0.3' // Add this line
}
```

2. In `AndroidManifest.xml`, add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to select images.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to take photos.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the multi-image picker.

# Complete Example of Multi Image Picker View

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:multi_image_picker_view/multi_image_picker_view.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Multi Image Picker Example',
      home: ImagePickerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ImagePickerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ImagePickerScreenState createState() => _ImagePickerScreenState();
}

class _ImagePickerScreenState extends State<ImagePickerScreen> {
  List<Asset> images = []; // List to hold selected images

  // Function to pick images
  Future<void> pickImages() async {
    try {
      // Use the multi_image_picker_view to pick images
      final List<Asset> resultList = await MultiImagePicker.pickImages(
        maxImages: 5, // Limit the number of images to select
        enableCamera: true, // Allow camera access
        selectedAssets: images, // Pre-select previously selected images
      );

      // Update the state with the selected images
      setState(() {
        images = resultList;
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during image selection
      print("Error picking images: $e");
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Multi Image Picker Example'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Display selected images
          Expanded(
            child: GridView.builder(
              gridDelegate: SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount(
                crossAxisCount: 3, // Number of columns in the grid
              ),
              itemCount: images.length,
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                return AssetThumb(
                  asset: images[index],
                  width: 300, // Width of the thumbnail
                  height: 300, // Height of the thumbnail
                );
              },
            ),
          ),
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: pickImages, // Call pickImages function on button press
            child: Text('Pick Images'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp and the home screen.
// 3. ImagePickerScreen is a StatefulWidget that manages the state of selected images.
// 4. The pickImages function is called when the user presses the "Pick Images" button.
// 5. The MultiImagePicker.pickImages method opens the image picker interface.
// 6. The selected images are stored in the 'images' list and displayed in a grid view.
// 7. The user can select up to 5 images and also has the option to take a new photo using the camera.
