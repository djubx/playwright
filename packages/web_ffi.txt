# Web FFI Package Overview
================================

The `web_ffi` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers, allowing them to call native C code from their Dart applications. This package provides a foreign function interface (FFI) for the web platform, enabling developers to leverage the performance and functionality of native code in their web-based Flutter apps.

## When to Use Web FFI
------------------------

You should consider using the `web_ffi` package in the following scenarios:

*   When you need to perform computationally intensive tasks, such as image processing, data compression, or scientific simulations.
*   When you want to reuse existing C code or libraries in your Flutter web app.
*   When you require direct access to hardware resources, such as the camera or microphone.

## Key Features
----------------

The `web_ffi` package offers the following key features:

*   Support for calling native C code from Dart.
*   Compatibility with the web platform.
*   Ability to load and use dynamic libraries.

# Setting Up Web FFI
=====================

To use the `web_ffi` package in your Flutter project, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add the Package Dependency

Add the `web_ffi` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  web_ffi: ^0.1.0
```

### Step 2: Import the Package

Import the `web_ffi` package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:web_ffi/web_ffi.dart';
```

### Step 3: Load the Dynamic Library

Load the dynamic library that contains the native C code:

```dart
final lib = WebFFI.loadLibrary('my_library');
```

### Step 4: Call the Native Function

Call the native function using the `lib` object:

```dart
final result = lib.myFunction();
```

### Platform-Specific Details

*   **Android:** To use the `web_ffi` package on Android, you need to add the following configuration to your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

    ```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        ndk {
            abiFilters 'armeabi-v7l', 'arm64-v8a', 'x86', 'x86_64'
        }
    }
}
```

*   **iOS:** To use the `web_ffi` package on iOS, you need to add the following configuration to your `ios/Podfile` file:

    ```ruby
target 'Runner' do
  ...
  pod 'web_ffi', :path => '../.symlinks/plugins/web_ffi/ios'
end
```

```dart
// Import the web_ffi package
import 'package:web_ffi/web_ffi.dart';

// Define the RealFlutter class
class RealFlutter {
  // Load the dynamic library
  final lib = WebFFI.loadLibrary('my_library');

  // Define the myFunction method
  int myFunction() {
    // Call the native function
    final result = lib.myFunction();
    return result;
  }
}

// Create an instance of the RealFlutter class
void main() {
  final realFlutter = RealFlutter();

  // Call the myFunction method
  final result = realFlutter.myFunction();

  // Print the result
  print('Result: $result');
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The RealFlutter class is defined, which loads the dynamic library and defines the myFunction method.
// 2. An instance of the RealFlutter class is created in the main function.
// 3. The myFunction method is called on the realFlutter instance.
// 4. The myFunction method calls the native function using the lib object.
// 5. The result of the native function is returned and printed to the console.

// Summary: The code flows by creating an instance of the RealFlutter class, calling the myFunction method, and printing the result of the native function.
