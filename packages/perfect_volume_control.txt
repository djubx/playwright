# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Perfect Volume Control Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **perfect_volume_control** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  perfect_volume_control: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Then, run the following command to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions to modify audio settings. Add the following line within the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to ensure that your app has the appropriate permissions to access audio settings. Open your `Info.plist` file and add the following key:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio playback.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement volume control in your app.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:perfect_volume_control/perfect_volume_control.dart';
```

2. Initialize the volume control in your main widget:

```dart
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  PerfectVolumeControl.init();
}
```

3. Use the provided methods to get and set the volume:

```dart
double currentVolume = await PerfectVolumeControl.getVolume();
await PerfectVolumeControl.setVolume(newVolume);
```

With these steps, you can easily integrate volume control into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using Perfect Volume Control

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:perfect_volume_control/perfect_volume_control.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Volume Control Example',
      home: VolumeControlScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class VolumeControlScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _VolumeControlScreenState createState() => _VolumeControlScreenState();
}

class _VolumeControlScreenState extends State<VolumeControlScreen> {
  double currentVolume = 0.5; // Default volume level

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the volume control
    PerfectVolumeControl.init();
    // Get the current volume level
    _getCurrentVolume();
  }

  // Method to get the current volume level
  Future<void> _getCurrentVolume() async {
    double volume = await PerfectVolumeControl.getVolume();
    setState(() {
      currentVolume = volume; // Update the state with the current volume
    });
  }

  // Method to set the volume level
  Future<void> _setVolume(double volume) async {
    await PerfectVolumeControl.setVolume(volume); // Set the new volume
    _getCurrentVolume(); // Refresh the current volume level
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Volume Control Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Current Volume: ${currentVolume.toStringAsFixed(2)}'),
            Slider(
              value: currentVolume,
              onChanged: (newVolume) {
                setState(() {
                  currentVolume = newVolume; // Update the slider value
                });
                _setVolume(newVolume); // Set the new volume
              },
              min: 0.0,
              max: 1.0,
              divisions: 10,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```
// This Flutter application demonstrates the use of the perfect_volume_control package.
// The app consists of a simple UI with a slider to control the device's volume.
// 
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets the home screen to VolumeControlScreen.
// 2. In the VolumeControlScreen state, we initialize the volume control and fetch the current volume level in initState.
// 3. The _getCurrentVolume method retrieves the current volume and updates the state.
// 4. The _setVolume method sets the new volume level based on the slider's value.
// 5. The build method creates a UI with a text display for the current volume and a slider for volume adjustment.
// 6. When the slider is moved, it updates the current volume and calls _setVolume to apply the change.
