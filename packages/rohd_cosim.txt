# Overview of the "rohd_cosim" Flutter Package

The `rohd_cosim` package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who need to integrate hardware description languages (HDLs) with their Flutter applications. This package allows for co-simulation of hardware and software, making it particularly useful for developers working on projects that involve FPGA or ASIC designs. 

## When to Use `rohd_cosim`
- **Embedded Systems**: When developing applications that require real-time interaction with hardware components.
- **Simulation**: For projects that need to simulate hardware behavior alongside software logic.
- **Testing**: When you want to test hardware designs in conjunction with Flutter UI.

## Key Features
- **Seamless Integration**: Easily integrates with existing Flutter applications.
- **Real-time Simulation**: Provides real-time feedback from hardware simulations.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Extensive Documentation**: Well-documented with examples to help developers get started quickly.

Overall, `rohd_cosim` is an essential package for developers looking to bridge the gap between software and hardware in their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `rohd_cosim`

## Installation
To get started with `rohd_cosim`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  rohd_cosim: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/rohd_cosim).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // or higher
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Podfile`.
2. Ensure that you have the following configurations:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0' # or higher
```

## Using the Package
Once you have installed the package and configured your project, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set up a basic co-simulation environment.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:rohd_cosim/rohd_cosim.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Rohd Cosim Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Rohd Cosim Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Start the co-simulation
              startCoSimulation();
            },
            child: Text('Start Co-Simulation'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void startCoSimulation() {
    // Initialize the co-simulation environment
    final cosim = RohdCosim();
    cosim.start();
    // Add your simulation logic here
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with a button that starts the co-simulation when pressed. The `RohdCosim` class is used to manage the simulation environment.

# Complete Example of `rohd_cosim`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:rohd_cosim/rohd_cosim.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Rohd Cosim Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Rohd Cosim Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Start the co-simulation
              startCoSimulation();
            },
            child: Text('Start Co-Simulation'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void startCoSimulation() {
    // Initialize the co-simulation environment
    final cosim = RohdCosim();
    cosim.start(); // Start the co-simulation process

    // Example of adding a simulation task
    cosim.addTask(() {
      // Simulate some hardware logic
      print('Simulating hardware logic...');
    });

    // Stop the co-simulation after a delay
    Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 5), () {
      cosim.stop(); // Stop the co-simulation process
      print('Co-simulation stopped.');
    });
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts and displays a button labeled 'Start Co-Simulation'.
// 2. When the button is pressed, the `startCoSimulation` method is called.
// 3. Inside this method, a new instance of `RohdCosim` is created and the co-simulation is started.
// 4. A simulation task is added, which prints a message to the console.
// 5. After a delay of 5 seconds, the co-simulation is stopped, and a message indicating that the co-simulation has stopped is printed to the console.
