# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Hideable Widget

## Installation
To use the hideable_widget package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  hideable_widget: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Then, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Usage
### Basic Example
To use the hideable_widget, you can wrap any widget with the `HideableWidget` class. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:hideable_widget/hideable_widget.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  bool _isVisible = false; // State variable to control visibility

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Hideable Widget Example')),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              setState(() {
                _isVisible = !_isVisible; // Toggle visibility
              });
            },
            child: Text(_isVisible ? 'Hide' : 'Show'),
          ),
          HideableWidget(
            isVisible: _isVisible, // Control visibility
            child: Container(
              padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
              color: Colors.blue,
              child: Text('This is a hideable widget!'),
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Platform-Specific Details
- **Android**: No additional configuration is required.
- **iOS**: Ensure that your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`.

### Optimizations
- Use the `HideableWidget` in conjunction with other state management solutions (like Provider or Riverpod) for better performance in larger applications.

With this setup, you can easily manage the visibility of widgets in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Hideable Widget

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:hideable_widget/hideable_widget.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Hideable Widget Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  bool _isVisible = false; // State variable to control visibility

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Hideable Widget Example')),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              setState(() {
                _isVisible = !_isVisible; // Toggle visibility
              });
            },
            child: Text(_isVisible ? 'Hide' : 'Show'), // Button text changes based on visibility
          ),
          HideableWidget(
            isVisible: _isVisible, // Control visibility
            child: Container(
              padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
              color: Colors.blue,
              child: Text('This is a hideable widget!'), // Content to show/hide
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which contains a stateful widget.
// 3. A boolean variable _isVisible is initialized to control the visibility of the hideable widget.
// 4. The build method constructs the UI, including an ElevatedButton and a HideableWidget.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the _isVisible state toggles between true and false.
// 6. The HideableWidget uses the _isVisible state to determine whether to show or hide its child widget.
// 7. The child widget is a Container with some text, which will appear or disappear based on the button press.
