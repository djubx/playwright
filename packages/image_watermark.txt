# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Image Watermark Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the `image_watermark` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  image_watermark: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/image_watermark).

## Step 2: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:image_watermark/image_watermark.dart';
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you are accessing the device's photo library. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to add watermarks to your images.</string>
```

## Step 4: Using the Package
You can now use the package to add watermarks to images. Below is a simple example of how to use the `image_watermark` package to add a text watermark to an image.

```dart
// Create a function to watermark an image
Future<void> watermarkImage() async {
  // Load your image
  final image = await loadImage('path_to_your_image.jpg');

  // Create a watermark
  final watermark = Watermark.text(
    text: 'Your Watermark',
    fontSize: 30,
    color: Colors.white,
    opacity: 0.5,
  );

  // Apply the watermark
  final watermarkedImage = await ImageWatermark.addWatermark(image, watermark);

  // Save or display the watermarked image
  await saveImage(watermarkedImage);
}
```

This function loads an image, creates a text watermark, applies it, and then saves the watermarked image.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the `image_watermark` package in your Flutter application effectively.

# Complete Example of Using the Image Watermark Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:image_watermark/image_watermark.dart';
import 'dart:io';
import 'package:image_picker/image_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Image Watermark Example',
      home: WatermarkHome(),
    );
  }
}

class WatermarkHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _WatermarkHomeState createState() => _WatermarkHomeState();
}

class _WatermarkHomeState extends State<WatermarkHome> {
  File? _image;

  // Function to pick an image from the gallery
  Future<void> _pickImage() async {
    final picker = ImagePicker();
    final pickedFile = await picker.getImage(source: ImageSource.gallery);

    if (pickedFile != null) {
      setState(() {
        _image = File(pickedFile.path);
      });
    }
  }

  // Function to add watermark to the selected image
  Future<void> _addWatermark() async {
    if (_image == null) return;

    // Load the image
    final image = await decodeImage(_image!.readAsBytesSync());

    // Create a text watermark
    final watermark = Watermark.text(
      text: 'Your Watermark',
      fontSize: 30,
      color: Colors.white,
      opacity: 0.5,
    );

    // Apply the watermark
    final watermarkedImage = await ImageWatermark.addWatermark(image, watermark);

    // Save or display the watermarked image
    // Here you can save it or display it in your app
    // For demonstration, we will just show a snackbar
    ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
      SnackBar(content: Text('Watermark added!')),
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Image Watermark Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            _image == null
                ? Text('No image selected.')
                : Image.file(_image!),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _pickImage,
              child: Text('Pick Image'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _addWatermark,
              child: Text('Add Watermark'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget (WatermarkHome).
// 3. The WatermarkHome widget maintains the state of the selected image.
// 4. The user can pick an image from the gallery using the _pickImage function.
// 5. Once an image is selected, it is displayed on the screen.
// 6. The user can then click the "Add Watermark" button, which triggers the _addWatermark function.
// 7. The _addWatermark function loads the selected image, creates a text watermark, and applies it.
// 8. Finally, a snackbar is shown to indicate that the watermark has been added.
