# Smoothie Flutter Package: A Comprehensive Overview

The "smoothie" Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to enhance the animation capabilities of your Flutter applications. It provides a seamless way to create smooth, high-performance animations with minimal effort. This package is particularly useful when you need to implement complex animations that require precise control over timing and transitions.

## When to Use the Smoothie Package

- **Complex Animations**: When your application requires intricate animations that involve multiple elements moving in sync.
- **Performance Optimization**: To ensure animations run smoothly without dropping frames, especially on lower-end devices.
- **Custom Animation Curves**: When you need to define custom animation curves for unique transition effects.

## Key Features

- **High Performance**: Optimized for smooth animations even on devices with limited resources.
- **Ease of Use**: Simple API that integrates seamlessly with existing Flutter widgets.
- **Customizability**: Offers a wide range of customization options for animation curves and timing.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works consistently across both Android and iOS platforms.

# Setting Up and Using the Smoothie Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up the "smoothie" package in a Flutter project and demonstrate how to use it to create smooth animations.

## Setup Process

### Step 1: Add Dependency

First, add the "smoothie" package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  smoothie: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:smoothie/smoothie.dart';
```

### Step 3: Platform-Specific Configurations

#### Android

Ensure your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

#### iOS

No specific configurations are required for iOS, but ensure your deployment target is set to iOS 9.0 or higher in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
```

## Using the Smoothie Package

To use the package, wrap your widget with the `RealFlutter` class provided by the package. This class allows you to define animations with custom curves and durations.

```dart
RealFlutter(
  duration: Duration(seconds: 2),
  curve: Curves.easeInOut,
  child: YourWidget(),
)
```

# Complete Example: Flutter Main File with Smoothie Package

Below is a complete example of a Flutter application using the "smoothie" package to create a smooth animation.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:smoothie/smoothie.dart'; // Import the smoothie package

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// Main application widget
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Smoothie Animation Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: AnimationDemoPage(),
    );
  }
}

// Page demonstrating the animation
class AnimationDemoPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _AnimationDemoPageState createState() => _AnimationDemoPageState();
}

class _AnimationDemoPageState extends State<AnimationDemoPage> {
  bool _isExpanded = false; // State to track the expansion of the widget

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Smoothie Animation Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: GestureDetector(
          onTap: () {
            setState(() {
              _isExpanded = !_isExpanded; // Toggle the expansion state
            });
          },
          child: RealFlutter(
            duration: Duration(seconds: 1), // Set animation duration
            curve: Curves.easeInOut, // Set animation curve
            child: AnimatedContainer(
              width: _isExpanded ? 200.0 : 100.0, // Change width based on state
              height: _isExpanded ? 200.0 : 100.0, // Change height based on state
              color: _isExpanded ? Colors.blue : Colors.red, // Change color based on state
              alignment: Alignment.center,
              duration: Duration(seconds: 1), // Duration for AnimatedContainer
              child: Text(
                'Tap Me!',
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// Application Flow Explanation
// 1. The `MyApp` class sets up the main application with a Material theme and a home page.
// 2. `AnimationDemoPage` is a stateful widget that manages the animation state.
// 3. The `_isExpanded` boolean tracks whether the widget is expanded or not.
// 4. A `GestureDetector` is used to toggle the `_isExpanded` state when the widget is tapped.
// 5. The `RealFlutter` widget wraps an `AnimatedContainer`, providing smooth animations.
// 6. The `AnimatedContainer` changes its size and color based on the `_isExpanded` state.
// 7. The animation duration and curve are defined in the `RealFlutter` widget for smooth transitions.
