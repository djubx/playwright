# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_moving_background

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_moving_background` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_moving_background` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_moving_background: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_moving_background/flutter_moving_background.dart';
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` if your background requires specific capabilities. For example:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to display backgrounds.</string>
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the `MovingBackground` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_moving_background/flutter_moving_background.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: MovingBackground(
        speed: 1.0, // Set the speed of the background movement
        direction: Direction.right, // Set the direction of movement
        child: Center(
          child: Text(
            'Welcome to RealFlutter!',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.white),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple `Scaffold` with a `MovingBackground` widget that moves to the right at a speed of 1.0. The text "Welcome to RealFlutter!" is displayed in the center.

## Step 5: Optimizations

To ensure smooth performance, consider the following optimizations:

- Use lower resolution images for backgrounds to reduce memory usage.
- Test on multiple devices to ensure consistent performance.

By following these steps, you can successfully integrate the `flutter_moving_background` package into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of flutter_moving_background

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_moving_background/flutter_moving_background.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Moving Background Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        body: MovingBackground(
          speed: 1.0, // Set the speed of the background movement
          direction: Direction.right, // Set the direction of movement
          child: Center(
            child: Text(
              'Welcome to RealFlutter!',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.white),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a title and a home property, which is a Scaffold.
// 4. The Scaffold's body is a MovingBackground widget that animates the background.
// 5. The MovingBackground widget has a speed of 1.0 and moves to the right.
// 6. In the center of the screen, a Text widget displays "Welcome to RealFlutter!".
// 7. The application runs smoothly, showcasing the moving background effect.
```
