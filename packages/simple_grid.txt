# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Simple Grid

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the **simple_grid** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  simple_grid: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your `ios/Podfile` has the platform version set to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:simple_grid/simple_grid.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using Simple Grid

You can now use the `SimpleGrid` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to implement it:

```dart
SimpleGrid(
  items: [
    // Your grid items here
  ],
  columns: 2, // Number of columns
  spacing: 10, // Space between items
)
```

This will create a simple grid layout with two columns and a spacing of 10 pixels between items.

# Complete Example of Simple Grid

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simple_grid/simple_grid.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Simple Grid Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Simple Grid Example'),
        ),
        body: SimpleGrid(
          items: List.generate(20, (index) {
            // Generate a list of items for the grid
            return Card(
              color: Colors.blueAccent,
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'Item $index',
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
                ),
              ),
            );
          }),
          columns: 2, // Set the number of columns in the grid
          spacing: 10, // Set the spacing between grid items
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Simple Grid Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold uses the SimpleGrid widget to display a grid of items.
// 5. The SimpleGrid generates 20 items using List.generate, each represented by a Card widget.
// 6. Each Card displays the item index and is styled with a blue background and white text.
// 7. The grid is configured to have 2 columns and 10 pixels of spacing between items.
```
