# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Line Chart Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To use the `line_chart` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  line_chart: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install the Package
Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Import the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:line_chart/line_chart.dart';
```

## Step 5: Basic Usage
You can now use the `LineChart` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a line chart:

```dart
LineChart(
  data: [
    LineChartData(
      x: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
      y: [2, 3, 5, 1, 4],
      color: Colors.blue,
    ),
  ],
)
```

This will create a basic line chart with one series of data points.

## Step 6: Customization
You can customize the chart by modifying properties such as `lineColor`, `pointColor`, and `lineWidth`. Refer to the package documentation for more options.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the `line_chart` package in your Flutter application effectively.

# Complete Example of Using the Line Chart Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:line_chart/line_chart.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Line Chart Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Line Chart Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: LineChart(
            data: [
              // Define the first line chart data
              LineChartData(
                x: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], // X-axis values
                y: [2, 3, 5, 1, 4], // Y-axis values
                color: Colors.blue, // Line color
              ),
              // Define the second line chart data
              LineChartData(
                x: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], // X-axis values
                y: [3, 2, 4, 5, 2], // Y-axis values
                color: Colors.red, // Line color
              ),
            ],
            // Additional chart properties can be set here
            lineWidth: 2.0, // Width of the line
            pointColor: Colors.black, // Color of the points
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Line Chart Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers a LineChart widget.
// 5. The LineChart widget takes a list of LineChartData objects, each representing a line.
// 6. The first LineChartData object defines the first line with blue color and specific x and y values.
// 7. The second LineChartData object defines another line with red color and its own x and y values.
// 8. The chart is displayed in the center of the screen with specified line width and point color.
```
