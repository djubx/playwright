# Tutorial: Setting Up at_onboarding_flutter

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `at_onboarding_flutter` package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `at_onboarding_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  at_onboarding_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/at_onboarding_flutter).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions added:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // or higher
    }
}
```

3. Add the necessary dependencies in the `dependencies` section:

```groovy
dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-auth:19.2.0' // or latest version
}
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera for onboarding.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library for onboarding.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the onboarding process.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:at_onboarding_flutter/at_onboarding_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Onboarding Example',
      home: OnboardingScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class OnboardingScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Onboarding')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Start the onboarding process
            AtOnboarding.startOnboarding();
          },
          child: Text('Start Onboarding'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app with a button that starts the onboarding process when pressed. The `AtOnboarding.startOnboarding()` method is called to initiate the onboarding flow.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the `at_onboarding_flutter` package into your Flutter application successfully.

# Complete Example of at_onboarding_flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:at_onboarding_flutter/at_onboarding_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Onboarding Example',
      home: OnboardingScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class OnboardingScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Onboarding')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Start the onboarding process
            AtOnboarding.startOnboarding();
          },
          child: Text('Start Onboarding'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp has a title and sets OnboardingScreen as the home widget.
// 4. OnboardingScreen is a StatelessWidget that builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. The Center widget contains an ElevatedButton.
// 6. When the button is pressed, it calls AtOnboarding.startOnboarding() to initiate the onboarding process.
// 7. The onboarding process will handle user authentication and onboarding steps as defined in the package.
