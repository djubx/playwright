Here's a detailed technical blog on the "display_metrics" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Display Metrics Flutter Package

The **display_metrics** Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to help developers access and utilize device display metrics in their Flutter applications. This package provides a simple and efficient way to retrieve information about the device's screen size, pixel density, and other relevant metrics, which can be crucial for creating responsive and adaptive user interfaces.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the **display_metrics** package in scenarios such as:

- **Responsive Design**: When you need to adjust your UI based on the device's screen size and resolution.
- **Adaptive Layouts**: To create layouts that adapt to different screen orientations and sizes.
- **Performance Optimization**: To optimize graphics and layout rendering based on the device's capabilities.

## Features

- **Screen Size**: Retrieve the width and height of the device's screen in pixels.
- **Pixel Density**: Access the device's pixel density (DPI), which helps in scaling UI elements appropriately.
- **Orientation**: Determine the current orientation of the device (portrait or landscape).
- **Aspect Ratio**: Get the aspect ratio of the device's screen, which is useful for media and layout adjustments.

By leveraging these features, developers can ensure that their applications provide a consistent and user-friendly experience across a wide range of devices.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Display Metrics Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **display_metrics** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  display_metrics: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you typically do not need to add any special permissions for this package. However, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least iOS 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`.

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:display_metrics/display_metrics.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package

You can now use the package to access display metrics. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to retrieve and display the screen size and pixel density:

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized(); // Ensure Flutter is initialized
  final metrics = await DisplayMetrics.getMetrics(); // Get display metrics
  print('Screen Size: ${metrics.size}'); // Print screen size
  print('Pixel Density: ${metrics.density}'); // Print pixel density
}
```

This code initializes the Flutter framework, retrieves the display metrics, and prints the screen size and pixel density to the console.

# Complete Example of Using the Display Metrics Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:display_metrics/display_metrics.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized(); // Ensure Flutter is initialized
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the main application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Display Metrics Example',
      home: DisplayMetricsScreen(), // Set the home screen
    );
  }
}

class DisplayMetricsScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DisplayMetricsScreenState createState() => _DisplayMetricsScreenState();
}

class _DisplayMetricsScreenState extends State<DisplayMetricsScreen> {
  Size? screenSize; // Variable to hold screen size
  double? pixelDensity; // Variable to hold pixel density

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _getDisplayMetrics(); // Call method to get display metrics
  }

  // Method to retrieve display metrics
  Future<void> _getDisplayMetrics() async {
    final metrics = await DisplayMetrics.getMetrics(); // Get metrics
    setState(() {
      screenSize = metrics.size; // Set screen size
      pixelDensity = metrics.density; // Set pixel density
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Display Metrics Example'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: screenSize != null && pixelDensity != null
            ? Column(
                mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
                children: [
                  Text('Screen Size: ${screenSize!.width} x ${screenSize!.height}'), // Display screen size
                  Text('Pixel Density: $pixelDensity'), // Display pixel density
                ],
              )
            : CircularProgressIndicator(), // Show loading indicator while fetching metrics
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```
// The application starts by initializing Flutter and running the RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget sets up a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// The DisplayMetricsScreen is a stateful widget that retrieves and displays the device's display metrics.
// In the initState method, _getDisplayMetrics is called to fetch the screen size and pixel density.
// The metrics are retrieved asynchronously, and once available, the state is updated.
// The build method displays the screen size and pixel density in a column.
// If the metrics are not yet available, a CircularProgressIndicator is shown to indicate loading.
```
