## Using the Package
To use the `search_map_place_updated` package, you can create a simple search interface. Below is a basic example of how to implement it in your Flutter app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:search_map_place_updated/search_map_place_updated.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Search Map Place Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Search Map Place'),
        ),
        body: SearchPlaceWidget(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SearchPlaceWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SearchPlaceWidgetState createState() => _SearchPlaceWidgetState();
}

class _SearchPlaceWidgetState extends State<SearchPlaceWidget> {
  String? _place;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        SearchMapPlaceWidget(
          apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY", // Replace with your Google API key
          onSelected: (place) {
            setState(() {
              _place = place.description; // Store the selected place description
            });
          },
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20),
        Text(_place ?? 'No place selected'), // Display selected place
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of `search_map_place_updated`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:search_map_place_updated/search_map_place_updated.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Search Map Place Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Search Map Place'),
        ),
        body: SearchPlaceWidget(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SearchPlaceWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SearchPlaceWidgetState createState() => _SearchPlaceWidgetState();
}

class _SearchPlaceWidgetState extends State<SearchPlaceWidget> {
  String? _place; // Variable to hold the selected place

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        // SearchMapPlaceWidget is the main widget for searching places
        SearchMapPlaceWidget(
          apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY", // Replace with your Google API key
          onSelected: (place) {
            setState(() {
              _place = place.description; // Update the state with the selected place
            });
          },
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20), // Add some spacing
        Text(_place ?? 'No place selected'), // Display the selected place or a default message
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The home of the app is a Scaffold containing an AppBar and the SearchPlaceWidget.
// 3. The SearchPlaceWidget is a stateful widget that manages the selected place.
// 4. Inside the SearchPlaceWidget, the SearchMapPlaceWidget is used to provide the search functionality.
// 5. When a user selects a place, the onSelected callback is triggered, updating the _place variable.
// 6. The selected place is displayed below the search widget, or a default message if no place is selected.
