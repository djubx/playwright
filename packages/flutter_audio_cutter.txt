# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_audio_cutter

## Installation
To get started with the `flutter_audio_cutter` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_audio_cutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_audio_cutter).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following keys to request permission for accessing the microphone and media library:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio cutting.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save audio files.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
Once you have installed the package and configured your project, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to cut an audio file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_audio_cutter/flutter_audio_cutter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Audio Cutter Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Define the path of the audio file to be cut
              String audioPath = 'path/to/your/audio/file.mp3';
              // Define the start and end points for cutting
              Duration start = Duration(seconds: 10);
              Duration end = Duration(seconds: 30);
              
              // Call the cutAudio method
              String? result = await FlutterAudioCutter.cutAudio(
                audioPath: audioPath,
                start: start,
                end: end,
              );

              // Check the result
              if (result != null) {
                print('Audio cut successfully: $result');
              } else {
                print('Error cutting audio');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Cut Audio'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a simple Flutter application with a button that, when pressed, cuts an audio file from 10 to 30 seconds.

# Complete Example of flutter_audio_cutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_audio_cutter/flutter_audio_cutter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Audio Cutter Example')),

              // Define the path of the audio file to be cut
              String audioPath = 'path/to/your/audio/file.mp3';
              // Define the start and end points for cutting
              Duration start = Duration(seconds: 10);
              Duration end = Duration(seconds: 30);
              
              // Call the cutAudio method
              String? result = await FlutterAudioCutter.cutAudio(
                audioPath: audioPath,
                start: start,
                end: end,
              );

              // Check the result
              if (result != null) {
                print('Audio cut successfully: $result');
              } else {
                print('Error cutting audio');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Cut Audio'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with a MaterialApp widget that contains a Scaffold.
// 2. An AppBar is created with the title 'Audio Cutter Example'.
// 3. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 4. An ElevatedButton is displayed, which triggers the audio cutting process when pressed.
// 5. Inside the onPressed callback, the path of the audio file is defined.
// 6. The start and end durations for cutting the audio are specified.
// 7. The cutAudio method from the flutter_audio_cutter package is called with the audio path and duration.
// 8. The result of the cutting process is checked, and a success or error message is printed to the console.
