# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Flutter Voice Processor Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_voice_processor` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_voice_processor` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_voice_processor: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_voice_processor).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

3. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request microphone access:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to the microphone for voice processing.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to initialize the voice processor and start processing audio.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_voice_processor/flutter_voice_processor.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late VoiceProcessor _voiceProcessor;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _initializeVoiceProcessor();
  }

  void _initializeVoiceProcessor() async {
    _voiceProcessor = VoiceProcessor();
    await _voiceProcessor.initialize();
    // Additional setup can be done here
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _voiceProcessor.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Voice Processor Example')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Voice Processor Initialized')),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize the `VoiceProcessor` in the `initState` method and dispose of it in the `dispose` method to free up resources.

# Complete Example of Using the Flutter Voice Processor Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_voice_processor/flutter_voice_processor.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late VoiceProcessor _voiceProcessor; // Declare the voice processor
  bool _isProcessing = false; // Flag to check if processing is active

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _initializeVoiceProcessor(); // Initialize the voice processor
  }

  // Method to initialize the voice processor
  void _initializeVoiceProcessor() async {
    _voiceProcessor = VoiceProcessor(); // Create an instance of VoiceProcessor
    await _voiceProcessor.initialize(); // Initialize the processor
    // Additional setup can be done here if needed
  }

  // Method to start processing audio
  void _startProcessing() async {
    setState(() {
      _isProcessing = true; // Set processing flag to true
    });
    await _voiceProcessor.start(); // Start the voice processing
  }

  // Method to stop processing audio
  void _stopProcessing() async {
    await _voiceProcessor.stop(); // Stop the voice processing
    setState(() {
      _isProcessing = false; // Set processing flag to false
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _voiceProcessor.dispose(); // Dispose of the voice processor
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Voice Processor Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text(_isProcessing ? 'Processing...' : 'Ready to Process'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _isProcessing ? _stopProcessing : _startProcessing,
              child: Text(_isProcessing ? 'Stop' : 'Start'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and the RealFlutter widget is created.
// 2. In the initState method, the voice processor is initialized.
// 3. The user sees a button to start processing audio.
// 4. When the button is pressed, it toggles between starting and stopping the audio processing.
// 5. The UI updates to reflect the current state (processing or ready).
// 6. When the app is disposed, the voice processor is cleaned up to free resources.
```
<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this complete example, we have created a simple Flutter application that initializes the `VoiceProcessor`, allows the user to start and stop audio processing, and updates the UI accordingly. The comments within the code explain each part of the application flow, making it easy to understand how the `flutter_voice_processor` package can be utilized effectively. 

### Summary of Application Flow
// The application initializes the voice processor when it starts. 
// The user can start or stop audio processing using a button, 
// and the UI updates to reflect the current state of processing. 
// Finally, resources are cleaned up when the application is disposed.
