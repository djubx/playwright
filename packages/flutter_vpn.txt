# Setting Up and Using the `flutter_vpn` Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_vpn` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_vpn` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_vpn: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_vpn).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.VPN"/>
   ```

2. **Service Declaration**: Also, declare the VPN service in the same file:

   ```xml
   <service android:name="com.example.flutter_vpn.VpnService" android:permission="android.permission.BIND_VPN_SERVICE"/>
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Capabilities**: Open your Xcode project, navigate to the "Signing & Capabilities" tab, and enable the "Personal VPN" capability.

2. **Info.plist**: Add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your Flutter application.

1. **Import the Package**:

   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter_vpn/flutter_vpn.dart';
   ```

2. **Initialize the VPN**:

   You can create a class to manage your VPN connections. Here’s a simple example:

   ```dart
   class RealFlutter {
     // Method to start the VPN
     Future<void> startVPN(String serverAddress, String username, String password) async {
       // Create a VPN configuration
       final config = VpnConfig(
         server: serverAddress,
         username: username,
         password: password,
       );

       // Start the VPN connection
       await FlutterVpn.connect(config);
     }

     // Method to stop the VPN
     Future<void> stopVPN() async {
       await FlutterVpn.disconnect();
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Listening to Connection Status**:

   You can listen to the VPN connection status using:

   ```dart
   FlutterVpn.onConnectionStatusChanged.listen((status) {
     print("VPN Status: $status");
   });
   ```

With these steps, you can successfully integrate the `flutter_vpn` package into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using `flutter_vpn`

Here’s a complete example of a Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the `flutter_vpn` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_vpn/flutter_vpn.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter VPN Example',
      home: VpnHome(),
    );
  }
}

class VpnHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _VpnHomeState createState() => _VpnHomeState();
}

class _VpnHomeState extends State<VpnHome> {
  final RealFlutter vpnManager = RealFlutter();
  String vpnStatus = "Disconnected";

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Listen for VPN connection status changes
    FlutterVpn.onConnectionStatusChanged.listen((status) {
      setState(() {
        vpnStatus = status.toString();
      });
    });
  }

  // Method to connect to the VPN
  void _connectVPN() async {
    await vpnManager.startVPN("vpn.server.com", "username", "password");
  }

  // Method to disconnect from the VPN
  void _disconnectVPN() async {
    await vpnManager.stopVPN();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter VPN Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('VPN Status: $vpnStatus'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _connectVPN,
              child: Text('Connect VPN'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _disconnectVPN,
              child: Text('Disconnect VPN'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The VpnHome widget is created, which manages the VPN connection state.
// 3. In the initState method, we listen for changes in the VPN connection status and update the UI accordingly.
// 4. The _connectVPN method is called when the user presses the "Connect VPN" button, initiating the VPN connection.
// 5. The _disconnectVPN method is called when the user presses the "Disconnect VPN" button, terminating the VPN connection.
// 6. The current VPN status is displayed on the screen, updating in real-time as the connection status changes.
```
