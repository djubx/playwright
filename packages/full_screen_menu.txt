# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Full Screen Menu Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the **full_screen_menu** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  full_screen_menu: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:full_screen_menu/full_screen_menu.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Setup
To use the **full_screen_menu**, you need to create a `RealFlutter` class that extends `StatelessWidget` or `StatefulWidget`. Hereâ€™s a basic setup:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: FullScreenMenu(
        items: [
          MenuItem(title: 'Home', icon: Icons.home),
          MenuItem(title: 'Settings', icon: Icons.settings),
          MenuItem(title: 'Profile', icon: Icons.person),
        ],
        onItemSelected: (item) {
          // Handle item selection
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
Ensure that your Android project is set up to support the latest Flutter features. Update your `android/app/build.gradle` file to use the latest SDK versions.

### iOS
For iOS, make sure to set the minimum deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Optimizations
- **Performance**: Use the `const` keyword for widgets that do not change to improve performance.
- **Testing**: Implement unit tests for your menu logic to ensure reliability.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the **full_screen_menu** package in your Flutter application effectively.

# Complete Example of Full Screen Menu

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:full_screen_menu/full_screen_menu.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Full Screen Menu Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Trigger the full-screen menu when the button is pressed
              showFullScreenMenu(context);
            },
            child: Text('Open Full Screen Menu'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void showFullScreenMenu(BuildContext context) {
    // Display the full-screen menu
    showDialog(
      context: context,
      builder: (context) {
        return FullScreenMenu(
          items: [
            MenuItem(title: 'Home', icon: Icons.home),
            MenuItem(title: 'Settings', icon: Icons.settings),
            MenuItem(title: 'Profile', icon: Icons.person),
          ],
          onItemSelected: (item) {
            // Handle the selected menu item
            Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the menu
            // Navigate to the selected item's corresponding screen
            // For example, you can use Navigator.push to navigate to a new screen
            print('Selected: ${item.title}');
          },
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which builds a MaterialApp.
// 2. Inside the MaterialApp, a button is displayed in the center of the screen.
// 3. When the button is pressed, the showFullScreenMenu method is called.
// 4. This method opens a dialog that contains the full-screen menu.
// 5. The menu displays three items: Home, Settings, and Profile.
// 6. When a menu item is selected, the onItemSelected callback is triggered.
// 7. The selected item is printed to the console, and the menu is closed.
```
