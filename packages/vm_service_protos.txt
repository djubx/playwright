# vm_service_protos Flutter Package

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
## Description

The `vm_service_protos` package is a Dart library that provides protocol buffers for the Dart VM service. This package is essential for developers who want to interact with the Dart VM service, enabling them to perform operations such as debugging, profiling, and inspecting running Dart applications. It is particularly useful for tools that need to communicate with the Dart VM, such as IDEs and performance monitoring tools.

### When to Use

You should consider using the `vm_service_protos` package when:
- You are developing a tool that needs to communicate with the Dart VM service.
- You want to build a custom debugging or profiling tool for Dart applications.
- You need to access VM service features programmatically.

### Features

- **Protocol Buffers**: Provides a set of protocol buffer definitions for the Dart VM service.
- **Interoperability**: Facilitates communication between Dart applications and external tools.
- **Extensive API**: Supports a wide range of VM service APIs, allowing for detailed inspection and manipulation of Dart applications.

## Tutorial

### Setup Process

To use the `vm_service_protos` package in your Flutter project, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `vm_service_protos` package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     vm_service_protos: ^latest_version
   ```

   Replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/vm_service_protos).

2. **Install Packages**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21.
   - **iOS**: No specific configurations are required, but ensure you have the latest Xcode version for compatibility.

### Using the Package

To use the `vm_service_protos` package, you will typically need to create a connection to the Dart VM service. Here’s a basic example of how to set up a connection:

```dart
import 'package:vm_service_protos/vm_service_protos.dart';

void main() {
  // Create a VM service client
  final client = VmServiceClient();

  // Connect to the Dart VM service
  client.connect('ws://127.0.0.1:8181/ws').then((_) {
    print('Connected to the Dart VM service');
  }).catchError((error) {
    print('Failed to connect: $error');
  });
}
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to establish a connection to the Dart VM service using WebSocket. Make sure to replace the WebSocket URL with the appropriate address for your Dart application.

## Complete Example

Here’s a complete Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the `vm_service_protos` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:vm_service_protos/vm_service_protos.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _connectionStatus = 'Disconnected';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _connectToVmService();
  }

  // Function to connect to the Dart VM service
  void _connectToVmService() async {
    final client = VmServiceClient();

    // Attempt to connect to the Dart VM service
    try {
      await client.connect('ws://127.0.0.1:8181/ws');
      setState(() {
        _connectionStatus = 'Connected to the Dart VM service';
      });
    } catch (error) {
      setState(() {
        _connectionStatus = 'Failed to connect: $error';
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('VM Service Protos Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(_connectionStatus), // Display connection status
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatefulWidget that manages its state through _RealFlutterState.
// 3. In the initState() method, the _connectToVmService() function is called to initiate a connection to the Dart VM service.
// 4. The _connectToVmService() function creates an instance of VmServiceClient and attempts to connect to the service.
// 5. If the connection is successful, the connection status is updated to 'Connected to the Dart VM service'.
// 6. If the connection fails, the error message is displayed.
// 7. The build() method returns a MaterialApp with a simple UI that shows the current connection status.
```
