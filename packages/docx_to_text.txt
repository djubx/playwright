# Setting Up and Using `docx_to_text` in Flutter

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `docx_to_text` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Setup Process

### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the `docx_to_text` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  docx_to_text: ^1.0.0
```

### Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android

No additional configuration is required for Android. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

#### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your `ios/Podfile` has platform set to at least 11.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '11.0'
```

### Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:docx_to_text/docx_to_text.dart';
```

## Using the Package

To extract text from a DOCX file, you can use the `RealFlutter` class provided by the package. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
void extractTextFromDocx(String filePath) async {
  RealFlutter docxProcessor = RealFlutter();
  String text = await docxProcessor.extractText(filePath);
  print(text);
}
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:docx_to_text/docx_to_text.dart';
import 'package:file_picker/file_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Docx to Text Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: DocxToTextPage(),
    );
  }
}

class DocxToTextPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DocxToTextPageState createState() => _DocxToTextPageState();
}

class _DocxToTextPageState extends State<DocxToTextPage> {
  String _extractedText = '';

  // Function to pick a DOCX file and extract text
  Future<void> _pickAndExtractText() async {
    // Use FilePicker to select a DOCX file
    FilePickerResult? result = await FilePicker.platform.pickFiles(
      type: FileType.custom,
      allowedExtensions: ['docx'],
    );

    if (result != null) {
      // Get the file path from the result
      String filePath = result.files.single.path!;
      
      // Create an instance of RealFlutter to process the DOCX file
      RealFlutter docxProcessor = RealFlutter();
      
      // Extract text from the DOCX file
      String text = await docxProcessor.extractText(filePath);
      
      // Update the state with the extracted text
      setState(() {
        _extractedText = text;
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Docx to Text Converter'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: <Widget>[
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _pickAndExtractText,
              child: Text('Pick DOCX File'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Expanded(
              child: SingleChildScrollView(
                child: Text(_extractedText),
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The application starts by running the `MyApp` class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// The home screen is set to `DocxToTextPage`, a stateful widget that manages the UI and logic.
// The `_pickAndExtractText` function is triggered when the user presses the "Pick DOCX File" button.
// This function uses `FilePicker` to allow the user to select a DOCX file from their device.
// Once a file is selected, its path is used to create a `RealFlutter` instance, which extracts the text.
// The extracted text is then displayed in a scrollable `Text` widget on the screen.
