# Setting Up and Using flutter_automation

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_automation` package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter applications.

### Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_automation` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_automation: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android Configuration

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        testInstrumentationRunner "androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner"
    }
}
```

3. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml` if your automation scripts require them.

#### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add any required permissions or configurations specific to your automation needs.

### Step 3: Writing Your First Automation Script

Create a new Dart file, e.g., `automation_script.dart`, and import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_automation/flutter_automation.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the automation framework
  final automation = RealFlutter();

  // Define your automation tasks
  automation.run(() {
    // Example task: Click a button
    automation.click('button_id');
    
    // Example task: Enter text in a text field
    automation.enterText('text_field_id', 'Hello, Flutter Automation!');
    
    // Example task: Verify the text
    automation.verifyText('text_field_id', 'Hello, Flutter Automation!');
  });
}
```

### Step 4: Running Your Automation Script

To run your automation script, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
flutter test automation_script.dart
```

This command will execute your automation tasks and provide feedback on their success or failure.

### Conclusion

With the `flutter_automation` package, you can easily set up and run automation scripts for your Flutter applications. The package's cross-platform support and customizable features make it an excellent choice for developers looking to enhance their testing processes.

## Part 3: Complete Example

<!-- START_MAIN -->
# Complete Example of flutter_automation

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_automation/flutter_automation.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// Main application widget
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Automation Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

// Home screen widget
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Automation Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Button to trigger automation
            ElevatedButton(
              key: Key('button_id'), // Key for automation
              onPressed: () {
                // Action when button is pressed
                print('Button Pressed!');
              },
              child: Text('Press Me'),
            ),
            // Text field for user input
            TextField(
              key: Key('text_field_id'), // Key for automation
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter Text'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Automation script to demonstrate package usage
void runAutomation() {
  final automation = RealFlutter();

  // Define automation tasks
  automation.run(() {
    // Click the button
    automation.click('button_id');
    
    // Enter text in the text field
    automation.enterText('text_field_id', 'Hello, Flutter Automation!');
    
    // Verify the entered text
    automation.verifyText('text_field_id', 'Hello, Flutter Automation!');
  });
}

// Application flow explanation
// The application starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// The HomeScreen widget contains a button and a text field.
// When the button is pressed, it prints a message to the console.
// The runAutomation function demonstrates how to use the flutter_automation package
// to automate interactions with the UI elements defined in the HomeScreen.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

### Summary of Application Flow

// The application begins with the `MyApp` widget, which initializes the Flutter app.
// The `HomeScreen` widget is displayed, containing a button and a text field.
// The button has a key assigned for automation purposes, allowing the `flutter_automation`
// package to interact with it. When the button is pressed, it triggers a print statement.
// The `runAutomation` function demonstrates how to use the `flutter_automation` package
// to automate tasks such as clicking the button, entering text in the text field, and
// verifying the entered text. This showcases the package's capabilities in a real-world scenario.
