# Overview of the dash_flags Flutter Package

The `dash_flags` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that allows for the easy management of feature flags within applications. Feature flags are a crucial part of modern software development, enabling teams to toggle features on and off without deploying new code. This can be particularly useful for A/B testing, gradual rollouts, or simply managing features that are still in development.

## When to Use `dash_flags`

- **Feature Management**: When you want to enable or disable features dynamically based on user roles, environments, or other conditions.
- **A/B Testing**: To test different versions of a feature with different user segments.
- **Gradual Rollouts**: To release features to a small percentage of users before a full rollout.
- **Configuration Management**: To manage application settings that may change frequently without requiring a new deployment.

## Key Features

- **Simple API**: The package provides a straightforward API for defining and checking flags.
- **Environment Support**: Easily manage flags for different environments (development, staging, production).
- **Dynamic Updates**: Flags can be updated at runtime, allowing for real-time feature management.
- **Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing Flutter applications.

By leveraging the `dash_flags` package, developers can enhance their applications' flexibility and responsiveness to user needs and business requirements.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using dash_flags

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `dash_flags` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `dash_flags` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dash_flags: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Basic Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # Ensure this is set to at least 10.0
```

## Step 3: Using dash_flags in Your Application

### Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:dash_flags/dash_flags.dart';
```

### Defining Feature Flags

You can define feature flags in your application as follows:

```dart
final flags = DashFlags({
  'new_feature': true,  // Enable the new feature
  'beta_feature': false, // Disable the beta feature
});
```

### Checking Feature Flags

To check if a feature is enabled, use:

```dart
if (flags['new_feature']) {
  // Execute code for the new feature
}
```

### Dynamic Updates

You can also update flags dynamically:

```dart
flags['new_feature'] = false; // Disable the new feature at runtime
```

## Conclusion

With these steps, you can effectively manage feature flags in your Flutter application using the `dash_flags` package. This allows for greater flexibility and control over your application's features.

# Complete Example of Using dash_flags

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dash_flags/dash_flags.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  // Define feature flags
  final flags = DashFlags({
    'new_feature': true,  // Feature flag for a new feature
    'beta_feature': false, // Feature flag for a beta feature
  });

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dash Flags Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Dash Flags Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text('Feature Flags Example'),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Check if the new feature is enabled
              if (flags['new_feature']) 
                Text('New Feature is Enabled!'),
              // Check if the beta feature is enabled
              if (flags['beta_feature']) 
                Text('Beta Feature is Enabled!'),
              // Button to toggle the new feature
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Toggle the new feature flag
                  flags['new_feature'] = !flags['new_feature'];
                },
                child: Text('Toggle New Feature'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget, we define our feature flags using DashFlags.
// 3. The build method constructs the UI, displaying whether the new feature and beta feature are enabled.
// 4. If the new feature is enabled, a message is displayed.
// 5. A button allows users to toggle the new feature on and off dynamically.
// 6. When the button is pressed, the state of the new feature flag is toggled, and the UI updates accordingly.
