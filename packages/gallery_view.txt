# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Gallery View Package

## Installation
To get started with the `gallery_view` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  gallery_view: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/gallery_view).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add permissions for accessing the photo library in your `Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to display images.</string>
```

## Using the Package
Once you have installed the package and configured your project, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `gallery_view` package in your app.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gallery_view/gallery_view.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Gallery View Example',
      home: GalleryScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class GalleryScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  // Sample list of image URLs
  final List<String> imageUrls = [
    'https://example.com/image1.jpg',
    'https://example.com/image2.jpg',
    'https://example.com/image3.jpg',
    // Add more image URLs as needed
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Image Gallery'),
      ),
      body: GalleryView.builder(
        itemCount: imageUrls.length, // Total number of images
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return Image.network(
            imageUrls[index], // Load image from URL
            fit: BoxFit.cover, // Cover the entire space
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The home screen is GalleryScreen, which contains a list of image URLs.
// 4. The GalleryScreen builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body that uses GalleryView.builder.
// 5. GalleryView.builder creates a scrollable gallery of images, where each image is loaded from the provided URLs.
// 6. The images are displayed using Image.network, which fetches images from the internet and fits them to cover the available space.
```
