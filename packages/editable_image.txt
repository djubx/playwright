# Complete Example of Editable Image Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:editable_image/editable_image.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Editable Image Example',
      home: EditableImageScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class EditableImageScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _EditableImageScreenState createState() => _EditableImageScreenState();
}

class _EditableImageScreenState extends State<EditableImageScreen> {
  // Variable to hold the image
  EditableImageController? _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the controller with a sample image
    _controller = EditableImageController(
      image: AssetImage('assets/sample_image.jpg'), // Load your image here
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Editable Image Example'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Display the editable image
          Expanded(
            child: EditableImage(
              controller: _controller!,
              // Optional: Add additional configurations here
            ),
          ),
          // Button to save the edited image
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Save the edited image
              final editedImage = await _controller!.getImage();
              // Handle the edited image (e.g., save to gallery)
            },
            child: Text('Save Image'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application using the editable_image package.
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 2. The EditableImageScreen widget is created to manage the image editing.
// 3. An EditableImageController is initialized with a sample image.
// 4. The EditableImage widget displays the image and allows for editing.
// 5. An ElevatedButton is provided to save the edited image, which can be handled as needed.

// This application flow allows users to load an image, edit it, and save the changes, showcasing the core functionalities of the editable_image package.
