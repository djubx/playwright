# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Implicitly Animated Reorderable List 2

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `implicitly_animated_reorderable_list_2` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  implicitly_animated_reorderable_list_2: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/implicitly_animated_reorderable_list_2).

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure your `ios/Podfile` has the platform version set to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that the package is set up, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement an implicitly animated reorderable list.

# Complete Example: Implementing Implicitly Animated Reorderable List 2

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:implicitly_animated_reorderable_list/implicitly_animated_reorderable_list.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Reorderable List Example',
      home: ReorderableListScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ReorderableListScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ReorderableListScreenState createState() => _ReorderableListScreenState();
}

class _ReorderableListScreenState extends State<ReorderableListScreen> {
  // List of items to display
  final List<String> _items = List.generate(10, (index) => 'Item $index');

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Implicitly Animated Reorderable List'),
      ),
      body: ImplicitlyAnimatedReorderableList<String>(
        items: _items,
        // This builder creates the UI for each item
        itemBuilder: (context, item, animation, index) {
          return SizeFadeTransition(
            sizeFactor: animation,
            child: ListTile(
              key: ValueKey(item), // Unique key for each item
              title: Text(item),
              tileColor: Colors.blueAccent,
              // Enable dragging
              onLongPress: () {
                // Start dragging the item
                setState(() {
                  _items.removeAt(index);
                });
              },
            ),
          );
        },
        // Called when an item is reordered
        onReorder: (oldIndex, newIndex) {
          setState(() {
            // Adjust the index if the item is moved down
            if (newIndex > oldIndex) newIndex--;
            // Move the item in the list
            final item = _items.removeAt(oldIndex);
            _items.insert(newIndex, item);
          });
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets RealFlutter as the root widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The ReorderableListScreen stateful widget maintains a list of items.
// 4. The ImplicitlyAnimatedReorderableList widget is used to create the reorderable list.
// 5. Each item is displayed using a ListTile, which can be dragged to reorder.
// 6. The onReorder callback updates the list when an item is moved, ensuring the UI reflects the changes.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the `implicitly_animated_reorderable_list_2` package. The application allows users to reorder a list of items by dragging and dropping them. 

### Summary of Application Flow

- The app starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` widget.
- The `RealFlutter` widget sets up a `MaterialApp` with a title and a home screen.
- The `ReorderableListScreen` widget maintains a list of items and displays them using the `ImplicitlyAnimatedReorderableList`.
- Each item can be reordered by dragging, and the list updates dynamically to reflect the changes.

This structure provides a clear understanding of how to implement and utilize the `implicitly_animated_reorderable_list_2` package in a Flutter application.
