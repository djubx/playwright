# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Sticky Footer ScrollView Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `sticky_footer_scrollview` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  sticky_footer_scrollview: ^0.4.0
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the platform version in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have added the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `StickyFooterScrollView`.

### Basic Usage

You can create a simple scrollable view with a sticky footer as follows:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sticky_footer_scrollview/sticky_footer_scrollview.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Sticky Footer ScrollView Example')),
      body: StickyFooterScrollView(
        footer: Container(
          color: Colors.blue,
          height: 60.0,
          child: Center(child: Text('Sticky Footer', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white))),
        ),
        content: ListView.builder(
          itemCount: 50,
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            return ListTile(title: Text('Item $index'));
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a `StickyFooterScrollView` that contains a footer and a list of items. The footer remains visible at the bottom of the screen while the user scrolls through the list.

# Complete Example of Sticky Footer ScrollView

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sticky_footer_scrollview/sticky_footer_scrollview.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Sticky Footer ScrollView Example')),
      body: StickyFooterScrollView(
        // The footer widget that will stick to the bottom of the screen
        footer: Container(
          color: Colors.blue, // Background color of the footer
          height: 60.0, // Height of the footer
          child: Center(
            child: Text(
              'Sticky Footer', // Text displayed in the footer
              style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white), // Text color
            ),
          ),
        ),
        // The main content of the scroll view
        content: ListView.builder(
          itemCount: 50, // Number of items in the list
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            return ListTile(
              title: Text('Item $index'), // Displaying item number
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget being built.
// 2. A Scaffold widget is created, which provides the basic material design visual layout structure.
// 3. An AppBar is added to the Scaffold with the title 'Sticky Footer ScrollView Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a StickyFooterScrollView widget.
// 5. The footer of the StickyFooterScrollView is defined as a Container with a blue background and a height of 60.0.
// 6. Inside the footer, a Center widget is used to align the text 'Sticky Footer' in the middle.
// 7. The content of the scroll view is a ListView.builder that generates 50 list items.
// 8. Each list item is represented by a ListTile displaying 'Item X', where X is the index of the item.
// 9. As the user scrolls through the list, the footer remains fixed at the bottom of the screen, enhancing usability.
