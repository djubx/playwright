import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ticket_clippers/ticket_clippers.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Ticket Clippers Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Ticket Clippers Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: TicketClipper(
            child: Container(
              width: 200,
              height: 100,
              color: Colors.blue,
