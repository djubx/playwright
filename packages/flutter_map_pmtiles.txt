# flutter_map_pmtiles: A Comprehensive Overview

The `flutter_map_pmtiles` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to integrate PMTiles (a format for storing map tiles) into their applications. This package is particularly useful for applications that require offline map capabilities, as it allows developers to load map tiles from local storage efficiently.

## When to Use This Package
- **Offline Mapping**: Ideal for applications that need to function without an internet connection.
- **Custom Map Styles**: When you want to use custom map styles that are stored in PMTiles format.
- **Performance**: For applications that require fast loading of map tiles without relying on external servers.

## Features
- **Offline Tile Loading**: Load map tiles from local PMTiles files.
- **Integration with Flutter Map**: Seamlessly integrates with the popular `flutter_map` package.
- **Customizable**: Offers options to customize the appearance and behavior of the map.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS, making it versatile for mobile app development.

Overall, `flutter_map_pmtiles` is an excellent choice for developers looking to enhance their Flutter applications with robust offline mapping capabilities.

# flutter_map_pmtiles: Setup and Usage Tutorial

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_map_pmtiles` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Installation

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_map_pmtiles` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_map: ^0.14.0
  flutter_map_pmtiles: ^0.1.0
```

After adding the dependencies, run `flutter pub get` to install the packages.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to load map tiles.</string>
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show maps.</string>
```

## Basic Usage

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in a Flutter application.

1. Import the necessary packages:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_map/flutter_map.dart';
import 'package:flutter_map_pmtiles/flutter_map_pmtiles.dart';
```

2. Create a simple Flutter app that displays a map using PMTiles:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('PMTiles Map Example')),
        body: FlutterMap(
          options: MapOptions(
            center: LatLng(51.5, -0.09), // Set the initial center of the map
            zoom: 13.0, // Set the initial zoom level
          ),
          layers: [
            TileLayerOptions(
              tiles: [
                // Load tiles from a local PMTiles file
                PMTileProvider('assets/your_pmtiles_file.pmtiles'),
              ],
              // Set the maximum zoom level
              maxZoom: 18,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays a map centered at a specific latitude and longitude. The map tiles are loaded from a local PMTiles file.

# Complete Example of flutter_map_pmtiles

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_map/flutter_map.dart';
import 'package:flutter_map_pmtiles/flutter_map_pmtiles.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('PMTiles Map Example')),
        body: FlutterMap(
          options: MapOptions(
            center: LatLng(51.5, -0.09), // Center the map at London
            zoom: 13.0, // Set the initial zoom level
          ),
          layers: [
            TileLayerOptions(
              tiles: [
                // Load tiles from a local PMTiles file
                PMTileProvider('assets/your_pmtiles_file.pmtiles'),
              ],
              maxZoom: 18, // Set the maximum zoom level
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body consists of a FlutterMap widget, which is configured with MapOptions.
// 5. The map is centered at the coordinates (51.5, -0.09) with an initial zoom level of 13.0.
// 6. The TileLayerOptions specify the tiles to be loaded from a local PMTiles file.
// 7. The map is displayed with the specified settings, allowing users to interact with it.
