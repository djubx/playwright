Here's a detailed technical blog on the `gits_cached_network_image` Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# gits_cached_network_image Flutter Package

The `gits_cached_network_image` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to efficiently load and cache images from the network. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where images are frequently accessed, as it minimizes network calls and enhances the user experience by providing faster image loading times.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using `gits_cached_network_image` in the following scenarios:

- **Image-heavy Applications**: If your app displays a lot of images, such as in galleries or social media feeds, caching can significantly improve performance.
- **Limited Network Connectivity**: In situations where users may have intermittent internet access, caching ensures that previously loaded images are still available.
- **Dynamic Content**: For applications that frequently update images from a server, caching can help reduce the load on your backend and improve responsiveness.

## Features

- **Automatic Caching**: The package automatically caches images, reducing the need for repeated network requests.
- **Placeholder Support**: You can specify placeholder images while the actual images are being loaded.
- **Error Handling**: The package provides built-in error handling for failed image loads.
- **Customizable**: You can customize the cache behavior and image loading options to suit your needs.

Overall, `gits_cached_network_image` is an essential package for any Flutter developer looking to optimize image loading in their applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up gits_cached_network_image

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `gits_cached_network_image` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  gits_cached_network_image: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to access the internet. Add the following line inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `Info.plist` to allow network requests:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:gits_cached_network_image/gits_cached_network_image.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the `CachedNetworkImage` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
CachedNetworkImage(
  imageUrl: "https://example.com/image.jpg",
  placeholder: (context, url) => CircularProgressIndicator(),
  errorWidget: (context, url, error) => Icon(Icons.error),
)
```

This widget will display a loading indicator while the image is being fetched and an error icon if the image fails to load.

## Step 5: Customizing Cache Behavior

You can customize the cache behavior by using the `CacheManager` class provided by the package. For example:

```dart
final customCacheManager = CacheManager(
  Config(
    'customCacheKey',
    stalePeriod: const Duration(days: 7), // Cache for 7 days
    maxNrOfCacheObjects: 100, // Maximum number of cached objects
  ),
);
```

You can then use this custom cache manager in your `CachedNetworkImage` widget.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the `gits_cached_network_image` package effectively in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of gits_cached_network_image

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gits_cached_network_image/gits_cached_network_image.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Cached Network Image Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('gits_cached_network_image Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: CachedNetworkImage(
            imageUrl: "https://example.com/image.jpg",
            placeholder: (context, url) => CircularProgressIndicator(), // Show loading indicator
            errorWidget: (context, url, error) => Icon(Icons.error), // Show error icon
            // Custom cache manager can be used here if needed
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'gits_cached_network_image Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a CachedNetworkImage widget.
// 5. The CachedNetworkImage widget attempts to load an image from the specified URL.
// 6. While the image is loading, a CircularProgressIndicator is displayed.
// 7. If the image fails to load, an error icon is shown instead.
// 8. This setup allows for efficient image loading and caching, enhancing the user experience.
