# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Vertical Page Stepper

## Installation
To use the `vertical_page_stepper` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  vertical_page_stepper: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your steps involve accessing device features (like camera or location).

## Basic Usage
To implement the vertical stepper, you can use the `VerticalPageStepper` widget provided by the package. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set it up:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:vertical_page_stepper/vertical_page_stepper.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Vertical Page Stepper Example')),
        body: VerticalPageStepper(
          steps: [
            Step(
              title: Text('Step 1'),
              content: Text('This is the content for step 1.'),
            ),
            Step(
              title: Text('Step 2'),
              content: Text('This is the content for step 2.'),
            ),
            Step(
              title: Text('Step 3'),
              content: Text('This is the content for step 3.'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic vertical stepper with three steps. Each step has a title and content, which can be customized further.

                ],
              ),
            ),
            Step(
              title: Text('Step 3'),
              content: Column(
                children: [
                  Text('This is the content for step 3.'),
                  TextField(decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter your password')),
                ],
              ),
            ),
          ],
          onStepContinue: () {
            // Logic to handle when the user continues to the next step
          },
          onStepCancel: () {
            // Logic to handle when the user cancels the step
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which builds a MaterialApp.
// 2. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a body.
// 3. The body contains a VerticalPageStepper widget, which takes a list of steps.
// 4. Each step has a title and content. The content can include various widgets, such as TextFields for user input.
// 5. The onStepContinue and onStepCancel callbacks can be used to define actions when the user navigates through the steps.
// 6. The user can fill in their name, email, and password in the respective steps, making it suitable for a multi-step form.
