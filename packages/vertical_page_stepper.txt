// The app starts by running the `main` function, which creates a `MaterialApp` widget.
// The `MaterialApp` widget is the root of the app, and it contains a `MyHomePage` widget.
// The `MyHomePage` widget is a stateless widget that contains a `Scaffold` widget.
// The `Scaffold` widget is a basic material design layout structure, and it contains an `AppBar` widget and a `VerticalPageStepper` widget.
// The `VerticalPageStepper` widget is the main content of the app, and it contains a list of `Page` widgets.
// Each `Page` widget contains a `Text` widget with a different text.
// The `pageIndicator` property is used to customize the page indicators, and the `validate` property is used to add page validation.

// When the user navigates through the pages, the `VerticalPageStepper` widget will animate the page transitions and update the page indicators.
// If the user tries to navigate to an invalid page, the `validate` function will return `false`, and the app will prevent the navigation.

// Overall, this app demonstrates the basic usage of the `vertical_page_stepper` package, including page navigation, page indicators, and page validation.
