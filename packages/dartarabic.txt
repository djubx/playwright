# Setting Up and Using the dartarabic Package

### Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `dartarabic` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and include the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dartarabic: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

### Step 2: Installing the Package

Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        // Ensure you have the correct minSdkVersion
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

#### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the `Info.plist` file to support Arabic localization. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>CFBundleLocalizations</key>
<array>
    <string>ar</string>
</array>
```

### Step 4: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Here’s a simple example of how to use the `dartarabic` package to display Arabic text correctly.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dartarabic/dartarabic.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Arabic Text Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(
            ArabicText('مرحبا بك في تطبيقنا'), // Arabic for "Welcome to our app"
            textDirection: TextDirection.rtl, // Set text direction to RTL
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

# Complete Example of Using dartarabic in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dartarabic/dartarabic.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dart Arabic Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Arabic Text Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Displaying Arabic text
              Text(
                ArabicText('مرحبا بك في تطبيقنا'), // Arabic for "Welcome to our app"
                textDirection: TextDirection.rtl, // Set text direction to RTL
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Formatting and displaying Arabic numbers
              Text(
                ArabicText.formatNumber(12345), // Formats number to Arabic
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Formatting and displaying Arabic date
              Text(
                ArabicText.formatDate(DateTime.now()), // Formats current date to Arabic
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange multiple Text widgets vertically.
// 5. The first Text widget displays a welcome message in Arabic, ensuring the text direction is set to RTL.
// 6. The second Text widget formats and displays a number in Arabic format.
// 7. The third Text widget formats and displays the current date in Arabic format.
// 8. The application provides a simple interface to demonstrate the capabilities of the dartarabic package.
```
