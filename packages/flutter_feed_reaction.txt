# Tutorial: Setting Up flutter_feed_reaction

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_feed_reaction` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_feed_reaction` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_feed_reaction: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file, depending on your app's requirements. However, for basic usage of `flutter_feed_reaction`, no specific configurations are required.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple widget that utilizes the `flutter_feed_reaction` package.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_feed_reaction/flutter_feed_reaction.dart';
```

2. Create a widget that uses the `FeedReaction` class:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Feed Reaction Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: FeedReaction(
          reactions: [
            FeedReactionType.love,
            FeedReactionType.haha,
            FeedReactionType.sad,
            FeedReactionType.angry,
          ],
          onReactionChanged: (reaction) {
            // Handle the reaction change
            print('User reacted with: $reaction');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple `Scaffold` with a `FeedReaction` widget that allows users to select from four different reactions. The `onReactionChanged` callback is triggered whenever a user selects a reaction.

With these steps, you have successfully set up and used the `flutter_feed_reaction` package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of flutter_feed_reaction

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_feed_reaction/flutter_feed_reaction.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Feed Reaction Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to hold the current reaction
  FeedReactionType _currentReaction = FeedReactionType.none;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Feed Reaction Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the current reaction
            Text(
              'Current Reaction: $_currentReaction',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // FeedReaction widget for user interaction
            FeedReaction(
              reactions: [
                FeedReactionType.love,
                FeedReactionType.haha,
                FeedReactionType.sad,
                FeedReactionType.angry,
              ],
              onReactionChanged: (reaction) {
                // Update the current reaction state
                setState(() {
                  _currentReaction = reaction;
                });
                // Print the selected reaction to the console
                print('User reacted with: $reaction');
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme, and specifies RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains the current reaction state.
// 4. In the build method, we display the current reaction and a FeedReaction widget.
// 5. When a user selects a reaction, the onReactionChanged callback updates the state and prints the reaction to the console.
```
<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this complete example, we have created a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the `flutter_feed_reaction` package. The application allows users to select a reaction, which updates the displayed text and logs the reaction to the console. The comments within the code provide a step-by-step explanation of the application flow, making it easy to understand how the package works in practice.
