- Displaying a success message after a user action, like saving data.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Toasty Box

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the Toasty Box package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  toasty_box: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the Toasty Box package:

```dart
import 'package:toasty_box/toasty_box.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using Toasty Box

### Basic Usage

To display a toast, you can use the `ToastyBox.showToast` method. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

  context: context,
  message: "This is a toast message!",
  duration: Duration(seconds: 2),
);
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions if you plan to use features that require them. However, for basic toast functionality, no additional permissions are needed.

#### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your app's deployment target is set to at least iOS 9.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
```

## Step 5: Customizing the Toast

You can customize the appearance of the toast by providing additional parameters:

```dart
ToastyBox.showToast(
  context: context,
  message: "Custom Toast!",
  backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
  textColor: Colors.white,
  duration: Duration(seconds: 3),
);
```

### Additional Options

- **Position**: You can specify the position of the toast (top, center, bottom).
- **Animation**: Control the animation style for showing and hiding the toast.

With these steps, you can easily integrate and customize the Toasty Box package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Toasty Box

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:toasty_box/toasty_box.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Toasty Box Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Toasty Box Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Show a toast message when the button is pressed
            ToastyBox.showToast(
              context: context,
              message: "Button Pressed!",
              backgroundColor: Colors.green,
              textColor: Colors.white,
              duration: Duration(seconds: 2),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Press Me'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
