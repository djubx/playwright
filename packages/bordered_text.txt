# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Bordered Text

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the **bordered_text** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  bordered_text: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:bordered_text/bordered_text.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using Bordered Text

You can now use the `BorderedText` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use it:

```dart
BorderedText(
  strokeWidth: 6.0, // Width of the border
  strokeColor: Colors.black, // Color of the border
  child: Text(
    'Hello, Bordered Text!',
    style: TextStyle(
      fontSize: 40.0,
      color: Colors.white, // Text color
    ),
  ),
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details

- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid compatibility issues.
  
  ```groovy
  android {
      ...
      defaultConfig {
          ...
          minSdkVersion 21
      }
  }
  ```

- **iOS**: No specific configurations are required for iOS, but ensure you have the latest version of Xcode installed.

### Optimizations

- For better performance, consider using the `const` constructor for `BorderedText` when the text and styles are static.
- Use `TextStyle` to define text styles separately for better readability and maintainability.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the **bordered_text** package in your Flutter applications effectively.

# Complete Example of Bordered Text

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bordered_text/bordered_text.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Bordered Text Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Bordered Text Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: BorderedText(
            strokeWidth: 4.0, // Set the border width
            strokeColor: Colors.blue, // Set the border color
            child: Text(
              'Welcome to Flutter!',
              style: TextStyle(
                fontSize: 50.0, // Set the font size
                color: Colors.white, // Set the text color
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with MyApp().
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. The Center widget contains the BorderedText widget.
// 5. BorderedText is configured with a blue border and a stroke width of 4.0.
// 6. Inside BorderedText, a Text widget displays "Welcome to Flutter!" with a font size of 50.0 and white color.
// 7. The result is a centered text with a blue border, creating a visually appealing effect.
```

// The application starts with the main function, which initializes the Flutter app. The MyApp class builds the main structure of the app, including an AppBar and a centered BorderedText widget. The BorderedText widget is configured with a blue border and a specified stroke width, while the inner Text widget displays a welcoming message in white. This creates a visually striking effect, demonstrating the capabilities of the bordered_text package effectively.
