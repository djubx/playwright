```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  marque_widget: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash

```

## Usage
### Basic Setup
To use the `marque_widget`, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```

### Platform-Specific Details
- **Android**: No additional configuration is required for Android.
- **iOS**: Ensure that your iOS deployment target is set to at least 9.0 in your `ios/Podfile`.

### Example Usage
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the `marque_widget` in your Flutter application:

```dart
MarqueWidget(
  text: 'Welcome to our Flutter App! Enjoy scrolling text effects.',
  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, color: Colors.blue),
  scrollAxis: Axis.horizontal, // Choose horizontal or vertical scrolling
  speed: 50, // Adjust the speed of scrolling
),
```

# Complete Example of Marque Widget in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:marque_widget/marque_widget.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Marque Widget Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Marque Widget Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: MarqueWidget(
            text: 'Welcome to our Flutter App! Enjoy scrolling text effects.',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, color: Colors.blue),
            scrollAxis: Axis.horizontal, // Set the scrolling direction
            speed: 50, // Set the speed of the scrolling text
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The main function initializes the Flutter app.
// The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the app's UI.
// Inside the build method, we create a MaterialApp with a title.
// The home property is set to a Scaffold, which provides the basic structure.
// An AppBar is added with the title 'Marque Widget Demo'.
// The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget to center the marquee.
// The MarqueWidget is instantiated with text, style, scrollAxis, and speed.
// The text will scroll horizontally at a speed of 50, styled in blue color.
```
<!-- END_MAIN -->
```

### Summary of Application Flow
The application starts by initializing the Flutter framework and running the `RealFlutter` widget. The `RealFlutter` widget builds a simple UI with a Material design. It contains an AppBar at the top and a centered marquee text in the body. The `MarqueWidget` is configured to scroll horizontally with a specified speed and text style, providing a dynamic and engaging user experience.
