# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Styled Text

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **styled_text** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  styled_text: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:styled_text/styled_text.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using Styled Text

You can now use the `StyledText` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use it:

```dart
StyledText(
  text: 'Hello, [bold]World![/bold] This is a [color=blue]styled text[/color].',
  styles: {
    'bold': TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
    'color': TextStyle(color: Colors.blue),
  },
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details

- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid compatibility issues.
  
```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

- **iOS**: No specific configurations are required, but ensure your deployment target is set to at least iOS 9.0 in your `ios/Podfile`.

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
```

## Step 5: Optimizations

For better performance, especially with large texts, consider using the `RichText` widget for static texts or caching styles if they are reused frequently.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate and use the **styled_text** package in your Flutter application effectively.

# Complete Example of Styled Text in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:styled_text/styled_text.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Styled Text Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Styled Text Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: StyledText(
            text: 'Welcome to [bold]Flutter[/bold]! Enjoy [color=green]styling[/color] your text.',
            styles: {
              'bold': TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold, fontSize: 24),
              'color': TextStyle(color: Colors.green, fontSize: 24),
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the Flutter application by calling runApp() with MyApp().
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a title and a home widget, which is a Scaffold.
// 4. The Scaffold has an AppBar with a title and a body that centers the StyledText widget.
// 5. The StyledText widget displays a welcome message with bold and colored text.
// 6. The styles are defined in a map, where 'bold' applies bold styling and 'color' applies green color to the text.
