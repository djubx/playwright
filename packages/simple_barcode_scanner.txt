# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Simple Barcode Scanner

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `simple_barcode_scanner` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `simple_barcode_scanner` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  simple_barcode_scanner: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/simple_barcode_scanner).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request camera access:

   ```xml
   <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to the camera to scan barcodes.</string>
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement barcode scanning.

# Complete Example of Using Simple Barcode Scanner

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simple_barcode_scanner/simple_barcode_scanner.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Simple Barcode Scanner',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: BarcodeScannerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class BarcodeScannerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _BarcodeScannerScreenState createState() => _BarcodeScannerScreenState();
}

class _BarcodeScannerScreenState extends State<BarcodeScannerScreen> {
  String scannedBarcode = "Scan a barcode";

  // Function to initiate the barcode scanning process
  void startBarcodeScan() async {
    // Start the scanner and wait for the result
    String result = await SimpleBarcodeScanner.scanBarcode();
    
    // Update the scannedBarcode state with the result
    setState(() {
      scannedBarcode = result;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Barcode Scanner'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              scannedBarcode,
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: startBarcodeScan, // Trigger the scan on button press
              child: Text('Start Scanning'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home screen is set to BarcodeScannerScreen, which is a stateful widget.
// 4. In BarcodeScannerScreen, we define a state variable 'scannedBarcode' to hold the result of the scan.
// 5. The 'startBarcodeScan' function is called when the button is pressed, which invokes the scanner.
// 6. The result of the scan is awaited and then displayed on the screen.
// 7. The UI updates to show the scanned barcode when the scan is complete.
```
