Here's a detailed technical blog on the "flavor_getter" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Flavor Getter Flutter Package

The **flavor_getter** package is a powerful tool for managing different flavors of your Flutter application. Flavors allow developers to create multiple versions of an app from a single codebase, which is particularly useful for managing different environments (like development, staging, and production) or branding variations (like white-label apps).

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the **flavor_getter** package when:
- You need to manage multiple configurations for your app (e.g., different API endpoints, themes, or feature sets).
- You want to streamline the process of building and deploying different versions of your app.
- You are working on a white-label solution where the same codebase serves multiple clients with different branding.

## Features

- **Easy Configuration**: Simplifies the setup of different flavors in your Flutter app.
- **Environment-Specific Variables**: Allows you to define environment-specific variables that can be accessed throughout your app.
- **Seamless Integration**: Works well with existing Flutter projects without requiring significant changes to your codebase.

By leveraging the **flavor_getter** package, you can enhance your development workflow and ensure that your app behaves correctly across different environments.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Flavor Getter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **flavor_getter** package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

First, add the **flavor_getter** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flavor_getter: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Configure Flavors

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Define your product flavors inside the `android` block:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    flavorDimensions "version"
    productFlavors {
        dev {
            applicationId "com.example.app.dev"
            versionName "1.0-dev"
        }
        prod {
            applicationId "com.example.app"
            versionName "1.0"
        }
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode.
2. Create new schemes for each flavor:
   - Go to `Product` > `Scheme` > `Manage Schemes`.
   - Duplicate the existing scheme and rename it to match your flavor (e.g., `Dev`, `Prod`).
3. Set the build configuration for each scheme to match the corresponding flavor.

## Step 3: Using Flavor Getter in Your Code

Now that you have configured your flavors, you can use the **flavor_getter** package in your Flutter code.

### Example Usage

In your main Dart file, you can access the current flavor and use it to configure your app:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flavor_getter/flavor_getter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Get the current flavor
    final flavor = FlavorGetter.getFlavor();

    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flavor Getter Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: flavor == 'dev' ? Colors.blue : Colors.green,
      ),
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Current Flavor: $flavor'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Welcome to the $flavor version of the app!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we use the `FlavorGetter.getFlavor()` method to retrieve the current flavor and adjust the app's theme and content accordingly.

# Complete Example of Flavor Getter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flavor_getter/flavor_getter.dart';

void main() {
  // Start the app by running the RealFlutter widget
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Get the current flavor of the app
    final flavor = FlavorGetter.getFlavor();

    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flavor Getter Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        // Change the primary color based on the flavor
        primarySwatch: flavor == 'dev' ? Colors.blue : Colors.green,
      ),
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Current Flavor: $flavor'), // Display the current flavor in the app bar
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Welcome to the $flavor version of the app!'), // Show a welcome message based on the flavor
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget, we retrieve the current flavor using FlavorGetter.getFlavor().
// 3. Based on the flavor, we set the primary color of the app's theme.
// 4. The app displays a simple UI with an AppBar showing the current flavor and a centered text message.
// 5. This allows developers to easily see which flavor they are running and customize the app's behavior accordingly.
