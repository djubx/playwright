# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:speech_to_text_google_dialog/speech_to_text_google_dialog.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Create an instance of the speech recognizer
  final SpeechToTextGoogleDialog _speechToText = SpeechToTextGoogleDialog();
  String _recognizedText = ""; // Variable to hold recognized text

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the speech recognizer
    _speechToText.initialize();
  }

  // Function to start listening for speech
  void _startListening() async {
    // Start the speech recognition dialog
    String result = await _speechToText.startListening();
    setState(() {
      _recognizedText = result; // Update the recognized text
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Speech to Text Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text(
                'Recognized Text:',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              Text(
                _recognizedText, // Display the recognized text
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _startListening, // Start listening on button press
                child: Text('Start Listening'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget, we create an instance of SpeechToTextGoogleDialog.
// 3. The initState method initializes the speech recognizer when the widget is created.
// 4. The _startListening method is called when the user presses the "Start Listening" button.
// 5. This method starts the speech recognition dialog and updates the recognized text.
// 6. The recognized text is displayed on the screen in real-time as the user speaks.
```
