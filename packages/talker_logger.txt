# Talker Logger Flutter Package

The **talker_logger** package is a powerful logging tool designed for Flutter applications. It provides a simple and effective way to log messages, errors, and other important information during the development and production phases of your app. This package is particularly useful for developers who want to maintain a clean and organized logging system, making it easier to debug and monitor their applications.

## When to Use Talker Logger

You should consider using the **talker_logger** package in scenarios such as:

- **Debugging**: When you need to track down issues in your application, logging can provide insights into the app's behavior.
- **Monitoring**: In production, logging can help you monitor the app's performance and catch errors before they affect users.
- **Analytics**: You can log user interactions and events to analyze user behavior and improve the app experience.

## Features

- **Customizable Log Levels**: You can set different log levels (e.g., debug, info, warning, error) to filter messages based on their importance.
- **Multiple Log Outputs**: The package supports logging to various outputs, including console, files, and remote servers.
- **Easy Integration**: The package is easy to integrate into existing Flutter applications with minimal setup.

# Tutorial: Setting Up Talker Logger

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **talker_logger** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the **talker_logger** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  talker_logger: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install Packages

Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` file to allow logging. Add the following key:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to log messages:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:talker_logger/talker_logger.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Talker Logger Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Create a logger instance
              final logger = TalkerLogger();

              // Log messages
              logger.debug('This is a debug message');
              logger.info('This is an info message');
              logger.warning('This is a warning message');
              logger.error('This is an error message');
            },
            child: Text('Log Messages'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app with a button that logs messages when pressed. You can customize the log messages and levels as needed.

# Complete Example of Talker Logger

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:talker_logger/talker_logger.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Talker Logger Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Create a logger instance
              final logger = TalkerLogger();

              // Log messages with different levels
              logger.debug('This is a debug message'); // Debug level log
              logger.info('This is an info message');   // Info level log
              logger.warning('This is a warning message'); // Warning level log
              logger.error('This is an error message'); // Error level log
            },
            child: Text('Log Messages'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 4. When the button is pressed, a new instance of TalkerLogger is created.
// 5. Various log messages are generated at different log levels (debug, info, warning, error).
// 6. These log messages can be viewed in the console or any configured output, helping developers track application behavior.
```

In summary, the **talker_logger** package provides a robust logging solution for Flutter applications. By following the setup and usage instructions, you can easily integrate logging into your app, allowing for better debugging and monitoring. The complete example demonstrates how to implement logging in a simple Flutter application, showcasing the package's capabilities effectively.
