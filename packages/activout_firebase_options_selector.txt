# Setup and Usage of activout_firebase_options_selector

## Installation
To get started with the `activout_firebase_options_selector` package, add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  activout_firebase_options_selector: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/activout_firebase_options_selector).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the necessary Firebase dependencies added. You may need to include the Google services plugin:

```groovy
apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
```

3. Add your `google-services.json` file to the `android/app` directory.

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode.
2. Add your `GoogleService-Info.plist` file to the Runner project.
3. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions and configurations set in your `Info.plist`.

## Basic Usage
To use the package, you will typically create a configuration class that extends the `FirebaseOptionsSelector` class. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:activout_firebase_options_selector/activout_firebase_options_selector.dart';

class RealFlutter extends FirebaseOptionsSelector {
  @override
  FirebaseOptions getOptions() {
    // Logic to select Firebase options based on your criteria
    return FirebaseOptions(
      apiKey: "your_api_key",
      appId: "your_app_id",
      messagingSenderId: "your_messaging_sender_id",
      projectId: "your_project_id",
    );
  }
}
```

This class can then be used to initialize Firebase in your application.

# Complete Example of activout_firebase_options_selector

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';
import 'package:activout_firebase_options_selector/activout_firebase_options_selector.dart';

class RealFlutter extends FirebaseOptionsSelector {
  @override
  FirebaseOptions getOptions() {
    // Here we return the Firebase options based on some logic
    return FirebaseOptions(
      apiKey: "your_api_key",
      appId: "your_app_id",
      messagingSenderId: "your_messaging_sender_id",
      projectId: "your_project_id",
    );
  }
}

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized(); // Ensures that Flutter is initialized
  await Firebase.initializeApp(
    options: RealFlutter().getOptions(), // Initialize Firebase with selected options
  );
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Firebase Options Selector Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Firebase Options Selector is working!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. We ensure that Flutter is initialized using WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized().
// 3. We then call Firebase.initializeApp() with the options provided by the RealFlutter class.
// 4. The MyApp widget is run, which sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 5. The HomeScreen widget is displayed, which contains a simple text message indicating that the Firebase Options Selector is functioning correctly.
