# Auto Hyphenating Text Flutter Package

The `auto_hyphenating_text` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to enhance text presentation in their applications. This package automatically hyphenates text, ensuring that long words are broken down appropriately when they reach the end of a line. This feature is particularly useful in applications where text readability is crucial, such as eBooks, articles, or any content-heavy app.

## When to Use This Package

- **Content-Heavy Applications**: If your app displays a lot of text, such as news articles or blogs, hyphenation can improve readability.

- **Multilingual Support**: The package supports multiple languages, making it suitable for international applications.

## Features

- **Automatic Hyphenation**: Automatically breaks words at appropriate points based on language rules.
- **Customizable**: Allows developers to customize hyphenation patterns and settings.
- **Performance Optimized**: Designed to handle large amounts of text without significant performance overhead.

By integrating this package, developers can significantly enhance the user experience by ensuring that text is displayed in a visually appealing and readable manner.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Auto Hyphenating Text Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `auto_hyphenating_text` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  auto_hyphenating_text: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable certain capabilities in your `Info.plist` file, depending on your app's requirements. However, the package should work out of the box without additional configurations.

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:auto_hyphenating_text/auto_hyphenating_text.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the AutoHyphenatingText Widget

You can now use the `AutoHyphenatingText` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
AutoHyphenatingText(
  'This is a long text that will be automatically hyphenated when it reaches the end of the line.',
  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
);
```

## Step 5: Customizing Hyphenation

You can customize the hyphenation settings by providing additional parameters:

```dart
AutoHyphenatingText(
  'This is a long text that will be automatically hyphenated.',
  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
  hyphenationPattern: HyphenationPattern.enUs, // Set the hyphenation pattern
);
```

With these steps, you can easily integrate the `auto_hyphenating_text` package into your Flutter application and enhance text readability.

# Complete Example of Using the Auto Hyphenating Text Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:auto_hyphenating_text/auto_hyphenating_text.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// MyApp is the main widget of the application
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Auto Hyphenating Text Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Auto Hyphenating Text Demo'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Column(
            children: [
              // Using AutoHyphenatingText widget to display hyphenated text
              AutoHyphenatingText(
                'This is a long text that will be automatically hyphenated when it reaches the end of the line. It is important for readability.',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
                hyphenationPattern: HyphenationPattern.enUs, // Set the hyphenation pattern
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Add space between texts
              AutoHyphenatingText(
                'Another example of a long text that demonstrates the hyphenation feature in this Flutter package.',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
                hyphenationPattern: HyphenationPattern.enUs, // Set the hyphenation pattern
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body consists of a Column that holds two AutoHyphenatingText widgets.
// 5. Each AutoHyphenatingText widget displays a long text that will be hyphenated automatically.
// 6. The hyphenation pattern is set to English (US) for both text widgets.
// 7. The layout is padded for better visual appearance, and a SizedBox is used to add space between the two text widgets.
```
