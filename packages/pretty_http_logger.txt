Here's a detailed technical blog on the "pretty_http_logger" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Pretty HTTP Logger Flutter Package

The `pretty_http_logger` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that enhances the debugging experience by providing a clean and readable log of HTTP requests and responses. This package is particularly useful during development, as it allows developers to easily track and analyze network calls made by their applications.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using `pretty_http_logger` in the following scenarios:

- **Debugging Network Calls**: When you need to inspect the details of HTTP requests and responses, including headers, body, and status codes.
- **Performance Monitoring**: To analyze the time taken for requests and responses, helping identify potential bottlenecks in network communication.
- **Error Tracking**: To log errors related to network calls, making it easier to troubleshoot issues.

## Features

- **Formatted Output**: Logs are displayed in a structured format, making it easy to read and understand.
- **Customizable**: You can customize the logging behavior, including what information to log and how to format it.
- **Supports Interceptors**: Works seamlessly with Dio, a powerful HTTP client for Dart, allowing you to intercept requests and responses.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Pretty HTTP Logger

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `pretty_http_logger` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dio: ^5.0.0  # Ensure you have Dio as well
  pretty_http_logger: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Configure for Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions for internet access:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

## Step 3: Configure for iOS

For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `Info.plist` to allow HTTP requests:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now, you can set up the `pretty_http_logger` in your application. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

```dart
import 'package:dio/dio.dart';
import 'package:pretty_http_logger/pretty_http_logger.dart';

class RealFlutter {
  final Dio dio;

  RealFlutter() : dio = Dio() {
    // Initialize the logger
    dio.interceptors.add(PrettyHttpLogger());
  }

  // Method to make a GET request
  Future<void> fetchData() async {
    try {
      final response = await dio.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
      print(response.data);
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error: $e');
    }
  }
}
```

In this setup, we create an instance of `Dio` and add the `PrettyHttpLogger` interceptor to it. This will log all HTTP requests and responses made through this `Dio` instance.

# Complete Example of Using Pretty HTTP Logger

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dio/dio.dart';
import 'package:pretty_http_logger/pretty_http_logger.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Pretty HTTP Logger Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  final Dio dio; // Declare Dio instance
  String responseData = ''; // Variable to hold response data

  _HomeScreenState() : dio = Dio() {
    // Add PrettyHttpLogger interceptor to Dio
    dio.interceptors.add(PrettyHttpLogger());
  }

  // Method to fetch data from the API
  Future<void> fetchData() async {
    try {
      // Make a GET request
      final response = await dio.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
      setState(() {
        responseData = response.data.toString(); // Store response data
      });
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        responseData = 'Error: $e'; // Handle error
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Pretty HTTP Logger Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: fetchData, // Fetch data on button press
              child: Text('Fetch Data'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(responseData), // Display response data
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a HomeScreen as its home.
// 3. HomeScreen initializes a Dio instance and adds the PrettyHttpLogger interceptor.
// 4. When the user presses the "Fetch Data" button, the fetchData method is called.
// 5. fetchData makes a GET request to the JSONPlaceholder API.
// 6. The response data is stored in the responseData variable and displayed on the screen.
// 7. If an error occurs during the request, it is caught and displayed instead.
