# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the ua_client_hints Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `ua_client_hints` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `ua_client_hints` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ua_client_hints: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/ua_client_hints).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` file to allow network requests. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is an example of how to retrieve and display user agent client hints.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ua_client_hints/ua_client_hints.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'UA Client Hints Example',
      home: UserAgentScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class UserAgentScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _UserAgentScreenState createState() => _UserAgentScreenState();
}

class _UserAgentScreenState extends State<UserAgentScreen> {
  String _deviceInfo = 'Fetching device info...'; // Placeholder for device info

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _fetchDeviceInfo(); // Fetch device info when the widget is initialized
  }

  // Function to fetch device information using the ua_client_hints package
  void _fetchDeviceInfo() async {
    try {
      // Retrieve user agent client hints
      final clientHints = await UaClientHints.getClientHints();
      setState(() {
        // Update the state with the retrieved device information
        _deviceInfo = 'Device Type: ${clientHints.deviceType}\n'
                      'Device Model: ${clientHints.deviceModel}\n'
                      'Screen Width: ${clientHints.screenWidth}\n'
                      'Screen Height: ${clientHints.screenHeight}';
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during the fetching process
      setState(() {
        _deviceInfo = 'Error fetching device info: $e';
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('User Agent Client Hints'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Text(
            _deviceInfo, // Display the device information
            textAlign: TextAlign.center,
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home screen.
// 3. The UserAgentScreen widget is a stateful widget that fetches device information.
// 4. In the initState method, _fetchDeviceInfo is called to retrieve user agent client hints.
// 5. The _fetchDeviceInfo method uses the ua_client_hints package to get device information.
// 6. The retrieved information is displayed on the screen, or an error message is shown if fetching fails.
```
