Here's a detailed technical blog on the "i_toast" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# i_toast Flutter Package

The `i_toast` package is a lightweight and customizable toast notification library for Flutter applications. Toasts are brief messages that appear on the screen to provide feedback to the user without interrupting their current activity. This package allows developers to easily implement toast notifications in their apps, enhancing user experience by providing timely feedback.

## When to Use `i_toast`

You might consider using the `i_toast` package in scenarios such as:
- Displaying success messages after a user action (e.g., form submission).
- Notifying users of errors or warnings (e.g., failed network requests).
- Providing contextual information (e.g., item added to cart).

## Features

- **Customizable Duration**: Control how long the toast is displayed.
- **Positioning**: Choose where the toast appears on the screen (top, center, bottom).
- **Custom Styles**: Modify the appearance of the toast, including background color, text color, and font size.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API for quick implementation in any Flutter app.

With these features, `i_toast` makes it easy to enhance user interaction through non-intrusive notifications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `i_toast`

## Step 1: Adding Dependency

To use the `i_toast` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  i_toast: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the `i_toast` package:

```dart
import 'package:i_toast/i_toast.dart';
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions. Typically, no special permissions are required for toast notifications, but ensure your app's theme supports the toast's appearance.

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to adjust your app's Info.plist file if you want to customize the appearance further. However, basic toast functionality does not require any special configurations.

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the `i_toast` package to display toast notifications. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to show a toast:

```dart
IToast.show("This is a toast message!", duration: 2, gravity: ToastGravity.BOTTOM);
```

### Customization Example

You can customize the toast's appearance as follows:

```dart
IToast.show(
  "Custom Toast!",
  duration: 3,
  gravity: ToastGravity.TOP,
  backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
  textColor: Colors.white,
  fontSize: 16.0,
);
```

This will display a blue toast at the top of the screen with white text.

With these steps, you can easily integrate and use the `i_toast` package in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Using `i_toast`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:i_toast/i_toast.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'i_toast Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('i_toast Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Show a toast message when the button is pressed
            IToast.show(
              "Button Pressed!",
              duration: 2,
              gravity: ToastGravity.BOTTOM,
              backgroundColor: Colors.green,
              textColor: Colors.white,
              fontSize: 16.0,
            );
          },
          child: Text('Press Me'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. HomeScreen is a StatelessWidget that contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, there is an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the IToast.show() method is called to display a toast message.
// 6. The toast appears at the bottom of the screen for 2 seconds, with a green background and white text.
```
