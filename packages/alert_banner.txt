**Setup and Usage**
-------------------

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Pubspec File

Add the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  alert_banner: ^1.0.0
```
Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:alert_banner/alert_banner.dart';
```
### Step 3: Create an Alert Banner

Create an `AlertBanner` widget and customize its properties:
```dart
AlertBanner(
  message: 'This is an important announcement!',
  style: AlertBannerStyle.success,
  dismissible: true,
  onDismiss: () {
    print('Banner dismissed!');
  },
)
```
### Platform-Specific Details

* Android: The `alert_banner` package uses the `SnackBar` widget under the hood, which is a part of the Material Design library. Therefore, you need to make sure that you have the `material.dart` library imported in your project.
* iOS: The `alert_banner` package uses the `CupertinoSnackBar` widget under the hood, which is a part of the Cupertino library. Therefore, you need to make sure that you have the `cupertino.dart` library imported in your project.

### Configurations and Optimizations

* You can customize the appearance of the banner by using the `style` property.
* You can make the banner dismissible by setting the `dismissible` property to `true`.
* You can add a callback function to the `onDismiss` property to handle the dismissal of the banner.

            AlertBanner(
              message: 'This is an error message!',
              style: AlertBannerStyle.error,
              dismissible: true,
              onDismiss: () {
                print('Error banner dismissed!');
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Create an Alert Banner with a warning style
            AlertBanner(
              message: 'This is a warning message!',
              style: AlertBannerStyle.warning,
              dismissible: true,
              onDismiss: () {
                print('Warning banner dismissed!');
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a screen containing three Alert Banners.
// 2. Each Alert Banner has a different style (success, error, warning) and is dismissible.
// 3. When the user dismisses an Alert Banner, the corresponding callback function is called.
// 4. The callback function prints a message to the console indicating which banner was dismissed.
// 5. The user can dismiss all three Alert Banners and see the corresponding messages printed to the console.

// This code demonstrates the usage of the Alert Banner package and its various features.
// It shows how to create Alert Banners with different styles and how to handle their dismissal.
