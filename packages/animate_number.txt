# Tutorial: Using the Animate Number Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started with the `animate_number` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  animate_number: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:animate_number/animate_number.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package
You can now use the `AnimateNumber` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
AnimateNumber(
  value: 100, // The number to animate to
  duration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Duration of the animation
  curve: Curves.easeInOut, // Animation curve
)
```

This will animate the number from 0 to 100 over 2 seconds with an ease-in-out curve.

# Complete Example of Animate Number

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animate_number/animate_number.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animate Number Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Animate Number Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying the animated number
              AnimateNumber(
                value: 100, // The target number to animate to
                duration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Duration of the animation
                curve: Curves.easeInOut, // Animation curve
                style: TextStyle(
                  fontSize: 48, // Font size of the animated number
                  fontWeight: FontWeight.bold, // Font weight
                ),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Spacing between widgets
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Action to perform when button is pressed
                  // This could be a reset or another action
                },
                child: Text('Press Me'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the animated number and a button vertically.
// 5. The AnimateNumber widget animates the number from 0 to 100 over 2 seconds with an ease-in-out curve.
// 6. The button is currently set up to perform an action when pressed, which can be customized further.
```
