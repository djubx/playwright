}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  Color selectedColor = Colors.red; // Default color

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Circular Color Picker Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the selected color
            Container(
              width: 100,
              height: 100,
              color: selectedColor,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Circular color picker
            CircularColorPicker(
              initialColor: selectedColor,
              onColorChanged: (color) {
                setState(() {
                  selectedColor = color; // Update the selected color
                });
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a simple Flutter application with a circular color picker. The selected color is displayed in a container above the picker.

# Complete Example of Circular Color Picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:circular_color_picker/circular_color_picker.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  Color selectedColor = Colors.red; // Initialize with a default color

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Circular Color Picker Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the currently selected color in a square container
            Container(
              width: 100,
              height: 100,
              color: selectedColor, // Set the container color to the selected color
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Add some space between the container and the picker
            // Circular color picker widget
            CircularColorPicker(
              initialColor: selectedColor, // Set the initial color
              onColorChanged: (color) {
                setState(() {
                  selectedColor = color; // Update the selected color when the user picks a new one
                });
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application starts with the RealFlutter widget.
// The selectedColor variable holds the currently selected color, initialized to red.
// The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the color display and the color picker vertically.
// The Container displays the selected color, and the CircularColorPicker allows the user to select a new color.
// When the user selects a color, the onColorChanged callback updates the selectedColor state, causing the UI to refresh and display the new color.
