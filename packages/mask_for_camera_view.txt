# mask_for_camera_view Flutter Package

The `mask_for_camera_view` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to implement camera functionalities with customizable overlays. This package allows you to create a camera view that can be masked with various shapes and designs, making it ideal for applications that require augmented reality features, photo filters, or custom camera interfaces.

## When to Use This Package
- **Augmented Reality Applications**: If you're building an AR app that requires a camera view with overlays.
- **Custom Camera Interfaces**: For apps that need a unique camera experience, such as photo booths or filters.
- **Interactive Games**: When you want to integrate camera functionalities with game mechanics.

## Features
- **Customizable Masks**: Easily apply different shapes and designs as masks over the camera view.
- **Real-time Camera Preview**: Provides a live camera feed with the ability to overlay masks.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that allows for quick setup and customization.

# Tutorial: Setting Up mask_for_camera_view

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `mask_for_camera_view` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the `mask_for_camera_view` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  mask_for_camera_view: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/mask_for_camera_view).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add camera permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request camera access:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera for augmented reality features.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save images.</string>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage
Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple camera view with a mask.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mask_for_camera_view/mask_for_camera_view.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Camera Mask Example')),
        body: MaskedCameraView(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MaskedCameraView extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaskForCameraView(
      mask: CircleMask(), // Example of a circular mask
      onCameraInitialized: (controller) {
        // Handle camera initialization
      },
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic camera view with a circular mask overlay.

# Complete Example of mask_for_camera_view

Here is a complete example of a Flutter application using the `mask_for_camera_view` package. This example demonstrates how to set up the camera view with a customizable mask.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mask_for_camera_view/mask_for_camera_view.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Camera Mask Example',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: CameraScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class CameraScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CameraScreenState createState() => _CameraScreenState();
}

class _CameraScreenState extends State<CameraScreen> {
  // This variable will hold the camera controller
  CameraController? _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the camera controller
    _initializeCamera();
  }

  void _initializeCamera() async {
    // Create a new camera controller
    _controller = await CameraController.create();
    // Notify the UI to rebuild
    setState(() {});
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the camera controller when the widget is removed
    _controller?.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Camera with Mask')),
      body: _controller == null
          ? Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator()) // Show loading indicator while initializing
          : MaskForCameraView(
              controller: _controller!,
              mask: CircleMask(), // Apply a circular mask
              onCameraInitialized: (controller) {
                // Handle camera initialization
                print('Camera initialized');
              },
            ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home as CameraScreen.
// 3. CameraScreen initializes the camera controller in initState.
// 4. Once the camera is initialized, the UI is rebuilt to show the camera view with a mask.
// 5. The MaskForCameraView widget displays the camera feed and applies the CircleMask overlay.
// 6. When the widget is disposed, the camera controller is also disposed to free resources.
