# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Multiple Search Selection Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **multiple_search_selection** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  multiple_search_selection: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your app requires any specific permissions related to the features you are implementing.

## Step 3: Basic Usage

To use the **multiple_search_selection** package, you can create a simple widget that utilizes the `MultipleSearchSelection` class. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:multiple_search_selection/multiple_search_selection.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Multiple Search Selection Example')),
        body: SearchSelectionWidget(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SearchSelectionWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SearchSelectionWidgetState createState() => _SearchSelectionWidgetState();
}

class _SearchSelectionWidgetState extends State<SearchSelectionWidget> {
  List<String> selectedItems = [];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        MultipleSearchSelection<String>(
          items: ['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3', 'Item 4'],
          onChanged: (values) {
            setState(() {
              selectedItems = values;
            });
          },
          hintText: 'Select items',
        ),
        Text('Selected Items: ${selectedItems.join(', ')}'),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application with a searchable selection widget. The selected items are displayed below the selection area.

# Complete Example of Multiple Search Selection

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:multiple_search_selection/multiple_search_selection.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Multiple Search Selection Example')),
        body: SearchSelectionWidget(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SearchSelectionWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SearchSelectionWidgetState createState() => _SearchSelectionWidgetState();
}

class _SearchSelectionWidgetState extends State<SearchSelectionWidget> {
  // List to hold selected items
  List<String> selectedItems = [];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        // MultipleSearchSelection widget for selecting items
        MultipleSearchSelection<String>(
          items: ['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3', 'Item 4'], // List of items to select from
          onChanged: (values) {
            // Update the selected items when the user makes a selection
            setState(() {
              selectedItems = values; // Update the state with selected values
            });
          },
          hintText: 'Select items', // Placeholder text for the selection box
        ),
        // Display the selected items below the selection widget
        Text('Selected Items: ${selectedItems.join(', ')}'), // Show selected items
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and the SearchSelectionWidget.
// 3. The SearchSelectionWidget is a stateful widget that maintains a list of selected items.
// 4. The MultipleSearchSelection widget displays a list of items that can be searched and selected.
// 5. When the user selects items, the onChanged callback updates the selectedItems list.
// 6. The selected items are displayed below the selection widget, updating in real-time as selections change.
