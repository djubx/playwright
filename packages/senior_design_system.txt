# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the `senior_design_system` Package

## Installation
To get started with the `senior_design_system` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  senior_design_system: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Basic Usage
To use the components from the `senior_design_system`, you can import the package in your Dart files:

```dart
import 'package:senior_design_system/senior_design_system.dart';
```

You can then start using the pre-built components in your Flutter widgets. For example, to create a button using the design system:

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // Handle button press
  },
  child: Text('Click Me'),
);
```

This button will automatically adopt the styles defined in the design system.

# Complete Example of Using the `senior_design_system` Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:senior_design_system/senior_design_system.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Senior Design System Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
        // Applying the design system theme
        textTheme: SeniorDesignSystem.textTheme,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Page'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Using a button from the design system
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action when button is pressed
                showDialog(
                  context: context,
                  builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                    title: Text('Hello!'),
                    content: Text('You clicked the button!'),
                    actions: [
                      TextButton(
                        onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                        child: Text('Close'),
                      ),
                    ],
                  ),
                );
              },
              child: Text('Click Me'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a theme that uses the design system's text theme.
// 3. The home page is set to HomePage, which contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the button vertically.
// 5. When the button is pressed, an AlertDialog is shown, demonstrating interaction with the design system components.
// 6. The dialog contains a title, message, and a button to close the dialog, showcasing the use of design system components.
