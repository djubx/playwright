# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Flutter Social Button Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_social_button` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_social_button: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_social_button).

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` file to allow for social media logins. Add the following entries:

```xml
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
    <dict>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
        <array>
            <string>your_facebook_app_id</string>
        </array>
    </dict>
</array>
```

Replace `your_facebook_app_id` with your actual Facebook app ID.

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_social_button/flutter_social_button.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Social Buttons

You can now use the social buttons in your widget tree. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the buttons:

```dart
SocialButton(
  buttonType: ButtonType.facebook,
  onPressed: () {
    // Handle Facebook login
  },
),
SocialButton(
  buttonType: ButtonType.google,
  onPressed: () {
    // Handle Google login
  },
),
```

This will create Facebook and Google login buttons that you can customize further.

# Complete Example of Using Flutter Social Button

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_social_button/flutter_social_button.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Social Button Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Social Login Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Facebook Social Button
              SocialButton(
                buttonType: ButtonType.facebook,
                onPressed: () {
                  // Handle Facebook login
                  print('Facebook button pressed');
                },
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Add space between buttons
              // Google Social Button
              SocialButton(
                buttonType: ButtonType.google,
                onPressed: () {
                  // Handle Google login
                  print('Google button pressed');
                },
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Social Login Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Column widget.
// 5. Inside the Column, two SocialButton widgets are created for Facebook and Google login.
// 6. Each button has an onPressed callback that prints a message to the console when pressed.
// 7. A SizedBox is used to add space between the two buttons for better UI.
```
