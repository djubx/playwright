Here's a detailed technical blog on the "flutter_cube" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Flutter Cube Package: A Comprehensive Overview

The **flutter_cube** package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to integrate 3D models into their applications. This package allows you to render 3D objects in a Flutter app using OpenGL, making it an excellent choice for applications that require 3D visualization, such as games, educational apps, or any interactive experience that benefits from 3D graphics.

## When to Use flutter_cube

You might consider using the **flutter_cube** package in scenarios such as:
- **Game Development**: When you need to display 3D models of characters, environments, or objects.
- **Educational Applications**: For interactive learning experiences that involve 3D representations of concepts (e.g., anatomy, architecture).
- **Product Visualization**: To allow users to view products in 3D, enhancing the shopping experience.

## Features

- **3D Model Rendering**: Supports various 3D model formats, including OBJ and MTL.
- **Interactive Controls**: Users can rotate, zoom, and pan the 3D models using touch gestures.
- **Customizable Lighting**: You can adjust the lighting to enhance the visual appeal of the models.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices.

With these features, **flutter_cube** provides a robust solution for integrating 3D graphics into your Flutter applications.

# Setting Up and Using flutter_cube

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the **flutter_cube** package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter applications.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **flutter_cube** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_cube: ^0.1.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to enable OpenGL ES in your project settings. Open `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode, navigate to the project settings, and ensure that the deployment target is set to at least iOS 9.0.

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_cube/flutter_cube.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the RealFlutter Class

You can now create a simple Flutter application that utilizes the **flutter_cube** package. Below, we will demonstrate how to set up a basic 3D model viewer.

# Complete Example of Using flutter_cube

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_cube/flutter_cube.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Cube Example',
      home: CubeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class CubeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CubeScreenState createState() => _CubeScreenState();
}

class _CubeScreenState extends State<CubeScreen> {
  // Create a CubeController to manage the 3D model
  late Object cube;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Load the 3D model from the assets
    cube = Object(
      fileName: 'assets/models/cube.obj', // Path to your 3D model
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('3D Cube Viewer'),
      ),
      body: Cube(
        onSceneCreated: (Scene scene) {
          // Add the cube object to the scene
          scene.world.add(cube);
          // Set the camera position
          scene.camera.position.z = 5;
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter class.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (CubeScreen).
// 3. CubeScreen is a StatefulWidget that manages the state of the 3D model.
// 4. In the initState method, we create an Object instance for the cube model, specifying the path to the .obj file.
// 5. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Cube widget.
// 6. The Cube widget's onSceneCreated callback is triggered when the scene is ready, where we add the cube object to the scene and set the camera position.
// 7. The app displays a 3D cube that users can interact with by rotating and zooming.
```
