# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Blobs Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the blobs package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  blobs: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Open the `Podfile` and uncomment the platform line, setting it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Blobs Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a blob shape.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:blobs/blobs.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Blobs Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Blob(
          size: 200, // Size of the blob
          styles: BlobStyles(
            color: Colors.blue, // Color of the blob
            elevation: 8, // Shadow elevation
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(home: RealFlutter()));
}
```

In this example, we create a simple blob in the center of the screen. You can customize the size, color, and elevation of the blob using the `BlobStyles` class.

# Complete Example of Using the Blobs Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:blobs/blobs.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Blobs Example')),
      body: Center(
        // Centering the blob in the middle of the screen
        child: Blob(
          size: 200, // Setting the size of the blob
          styles: BlobStyles(
            color: Colors.blue, // Setting the color of the blob
            elevation: 8, // Adding shadow elevation for depth
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(home: RealFlutter()));
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. It runs the MaterialApp widget, which is the root of the app.
// 3. The RealFlutter class is defined as a StatelessWidget.
// 4. Inside the build method, a Scaffold widget is created.
// 5. The AppBar is set with a title "Blobs Example".
// 6. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget to center the blob.
// 7. A Blob widget is created with a size of 200, a blue color, and an elevation of 8.
// 8. The Blob widget is displayed in the center of the screen, creating a visually appealing UI element.
```
