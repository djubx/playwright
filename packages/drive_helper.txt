# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Drive Helper

## Installation
To add the drive_helper package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  drive_helper: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/drive_helper).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions to allow file access:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request permission for file access:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save files.</string>
<key>NSDocumentsFolderUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your documents folder to manage files.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the drive_helper package, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:drive_helper/drive_helper.dart';
```

You can then create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class to manage your file operations.

### Example Code Snippet
```dart
// Create a new file
final file = await RealFlutter.createFile('example.txt', 'Hello, Drive Helper!');
```

This snippet demonstrates how to create a new file named `example.txt` with the content "Hello, Drive Helper!".

With these steps, you are now ready to utilize the drive_helper package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Drive Helper

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:drive_helper/drive_helper.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Drive Helper Example',
      home: FileManager(),
    );
  }
}

class FileManager extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _FileManagerState createState() => _FileManagerState();
}

class _FileManagerState extends State<FileManager> {
  String _fileContent = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _readFile(); // Read the file when the widget is initialized
  }

  // Method to create a file
  Future<void> _createFile() async {
    // Create a new file named 'example.txt' with some content
    await RealFlutter.createFile('example.txt', 'Hello, Drive Helper!');
    _readFile(); // Read the file after creation
  }

  // Method to read the file
  Future<void> _readFile() async {
    // Read the content of 'example.txt'
    String content = await RealFlutter.readFile('example.txt');
    setState(() {
      _fileContent = content; // Update the state with the file content
    });
  }

  // Method to delete the file
  Future<void> _deleteFile() async {
    await RealFlutter.deleteFile('example.txt'); // Delete the file
    setState(() {
      _fileContent = ''; // Clear the content after deletion
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Drive Helper Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('File Content:'),
            Text(_fileContent), // Display the file content
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _createFile, // Create file button
              child: Text('Create File'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _deleteFile, // Delete file button
              child: Text('Delete File'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation
// The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `MyApp` widget.
// `MyApp` sets up the MaterialApp and points to the `FileManager` widget as the home screen.
// In the `FileManager` stateful widget, we initialize the file content to an empty string.
// The `_createFile` method creates a new file named 'example.txt' with the text "Hello, Drive Helper!".
// After creating the file, it calls `_readFile` to read the content of the file and update the UI.
// The `_readFile` method reads the content of 'example.txt' and updates the `_fileContent` state variable.
// The UI displays the file content and provides buttons to create and delete the file.
// The `_deleteFile` method deletes 'example.txt' and clears the displayed content.
// This flow allows users to create, read, and delete files using the drive_helper package.
