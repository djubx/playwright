# Setting Up and Using the butterfly_dialog Package

## Installation

To get started with `butterfly_dialog`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  butterfly_dialog: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` to allow for any specific permissions required by your dialogs, although `butterfly_dialog` typically does not require additional permissions.

## Using the Package

To use `butterfly_dialog`, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:butterfly_dialog/butterfly_dialog.dart';
```

You can then create and display a dialog using the following code snippet:

```dart
ButterflyDialog.show(
  context: context,
  title: 'Hello, Flutter!',
  content: 'This is a customizable dialog using butterfly_dialog.',
  onConfirm: () {
    // Handle confirmation action
  },
);
```

This simple setup allows you to present a dialog with a title, content, and a confirmation action. You can further customize the dialog by adding more parameters as needed.

# Complete Example of butterfly_dialog in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:butterfly_dialog/butterfly_dialog.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Butterfly Dialog Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Butterfly Dialog Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Trigger the dialog when the button is pressed
              ButterflyDialog.show(
                context: context,
                title: 'Welcome!',
                content: 'This is a demo of the butterfly_dialog package.',
                onConfirm: () {
                  // Action to perform on confirmation
                  Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                },
                onCancel: () {
                  // Action to perform on cancellation
                  Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                },
              );
            },
            child: Text('Show Dialog'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'Butterfly Dialog Demo'.
// 4. The body contains a Center widget that centers an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the ButterflyDialog.show method is called.
// 6. The dialog displays a title and content, along with confirm and cancel actions.
// 7. On confirmation or cancellation, the dialog is closed using Navigator.of(context).pop().
// 8. This flow allows users to interact with the dialog and perform actions based on their choices.
