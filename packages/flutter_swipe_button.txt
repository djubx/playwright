# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Flutter Swipe Button Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_swipe_button` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_swipe_button: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the swipe button.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_swipe_button/flutter_swipe_button.dart';
```

2. Use the `SwipeButton` widget in your widget tree:

```dart
SwipeButton(
  onSwipe: () {
    // Action to perform on swipe
    print("Button Swiped!");
  },
  child: Text("Swipe to Confirm"),
)
```

This basic setup will create a swipe button that prints a message when swiped.

## Step 4: Customization

You can customize the appearance of the swipe button by using various properties:

```dart
SwipeButton(
  onSwipe: () {
    print("Button Swiped!");
  },
  child: Text("Swipe to Confirm"),
  backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
  buttonColor: Colors.green,
  buttonText: "Swipe Me",
)
```

This customization allows you to change the button's background color, button color, and text.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the `flutter_swipe_button` package into your Flutter application seamlessly.

# Complete Example of Flutter Swipe Button

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_swipe_button/flutter_swipe_button.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Swipe Button Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Swipe Button Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: SwipeButton(
            onSwipe: () {
              // This function is called when the button is swiped
              // Here you can perform the action you want to confirm
              print("Button Swiped! Action Confirmed.");
            },
            child: Container(
              width: 200,
              height: 50,
              alignment: Alignment.center,
              child: Text(
                "Swipe to Confirm",
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 18),
              ),
              decoration: BoxDecoration(
                color: Colors.blue,
                borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(25),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Swipe Button Demo".
// 4. In the body of the Scaffold, a Center widget is used to center the SwipeButton.
// 5. The SwipeButton widget is configured with an onSwipe callback that prints a confirmation message.
// 6. The child of the SwipeButton is a Container styled to look like a button with rounded corners and a blue background.
// 7. When the user swipes the button, the onSwipe function is triggered, confirming the action.
```
