# Tutorial: Setting Up giphy_picker

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **giphy_picker** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the **giphy_picker** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  giphy_picker: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Configure iOS and Android

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions to allow internet access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

### Android Configuration

2. Ensure you have the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the GIF picker.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:giphy_picker/giphy_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Giphy Picker Example',
      home: GiphyPickerExample(),
    );
  }
}

class GiphyPickerExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _GiphyPickerExampleState createState() => _GiphyPickerExampleState();
}

class _GiphyPickerExampleState extends State<GiphyPickerExample> {
  String? _gifUrl; // Variable to hold the selected GIF URL

  // Function to show the Giphy picker
  Future<void> _pickGif() async {
    final gif = await GiphyPicker.pickGif(
      context: context,
      apiKey: 'YOUR_GIPHY_API_KEY', // Replace with your Giphy API key
      // Optional parameters
      // You can customize the picker with additional options
    );

    // Check if a GIF was selected
    if (gif != null) {
      setState(() {
        _gifUrl = gif.images?.fixedHeight?.url; // Store the selected GIF URL
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Giphy Picker Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the selected GIF if available
            if (_gifUrl != null)
              Image.network(
                _gifUrl!,
                height: 200, // Set height for the GIF display
              ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _pickGif, // Call the function to pick a GIF
              child: Text('Pick a GIF'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home widget.
// 3. GiphyPickerExample is a StatefulWidget that manages the state of the selected GIF.
// 4. The _pickGif function is called when the button is pressed, which opens the Giphy picker.
// 5. If a GIF is selected, its URL is stored in the _gifUrl variable, and the UI is updated to display the GIF.
// 6. The selected GIF is displayed in an Image widget if _gifUrl is not null.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this blog, we covered the **giphy_picker** Flutter package, including its description, setup tutorial, and a complete example. The application flow is straightforward: it initializes the app, allows users to pick a GIF, and displays the selected GIF on the screen. This package is a great addition to any Flutter application that aims to enhance user engagement with animated content.
