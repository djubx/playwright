Here's a detailed technical blog on the "clean_framework" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Clean Framework Flutter Package

The **clean_framework** package is a powerful tool designed to help Flutter developers implement clean architecture principles in their applications. It provides a structured way to separate concerns, making your codebase more maintainable, testable, and scalable. 

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the **clean_framework** package when:
- You are building a complex application that requires a clear separation of business logic from UI.
- You want to implement a test-driven development (TDD) approach.
- You need to maintain a large codebase with multiple developers, ensuring that everyone adheres to the same architectural principles.

## Key Features
- **Separation of Concerns**: The package encourages a clear division between the UI, business logic, and data layers.
- **Testability**: By following clean architecture principles, your code becomes easier to test.
- **Scalability**: The structure allows for easy scaling of the application as new features are added.
- **Flexibility**: You can easily swap out implementations for different platforms or services.

In summary, the **clean_framework** package is an excellent choice for developers looking to implement clean architecture in their Flutter applications, ensuring a robust and maintainable codebase.

# Tutorial: Setting Up Clean Framework

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **clean_framework** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **clean_framework** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  clean_framework: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/clean_framework).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, ensure that your `ios/Podfile` is set to use at least iOS 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

To use the **clean_framework** package, you will typically create a `ViewModel`, `UseCase`, and `Repository`. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set up these components:

1. **Create a Model**: Define your data model.
2. **Create a Repository**: Implement the repository pattern to manage data.
3. **Create a UseCase**: Define the business logic.
4. **Create a ViewModel**: Connect the UI with the UseCase.
5. **Build the UI**: Use the ViewModel in your Flutter widgets.

This structure allows you to maintain a clean separation of concerns, making your application easier to manage and test.

# Complete Example of Clean Framework

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:clean_framework/clean_framework.dart';

// Define a simple model
class UserModel {
  final String name;
  UserModel({required this.name});
}

// Create a repository to manage user data
class UserRepository {
  UserModel getUser() {
    // Simulate fetching user data
    return UserModel(name: "John Doe");
  }
}

// Define a use case for user-related business logic
class GetUserUseCase {
  final UserRepository userRepository;

  GetUserUseCase(this.userRepository);

  UserModel execute() {
    // Fetch user data from the repository
    return userRepository.getUser();
  }
}

// Create a ViewModel to connect the UI with the use case
class UserViewModel extends ViewModel {
  final GetUserUseCase getUserUseCase;
  UserModel? user;

  UserViewModel(this.getUserUseCase);

  void fetchUser() {
    // Call the use case to fetch user data
    user = getUserUseCase.execute();
    notifyListeners(); // Notify the UI to rebuild
  }
}

// Main application entry point
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Clean Framework Example',
      home: UserScreen(),
    );
  }
}

// Create a screen to display user information
class UserScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Initialize the repository and use case
    final userRepository = UserRepository();
    final getUserUseCase = GetUserUseCase(userRepository);
    final userViewModel = UserViewModel(getUserUseCase);

    // Fetch user data
    userViewModel.fetchUser();

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('User Info')),
      body: Center(
        child: ValueListenableBuilder(
          valueListenable: userViewModel,
          builder: (context, value, child) {
            // Display user name when available
            return Text(userViewModel.user?.name ?? 'Loading...');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which runs MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds the UserScreen widget.
// 3. In UserScreen, we initialize the UserRepository and GetUserUseCase.
// 4. We create a UserViewModel instance and call fetchUser() to get user data.
// 5. The ViewModel fetches the user data from the repository and notifies listeners.
// 6. The UI updates to display the user's name once it's fetched.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we demonstrated how to set up a simple Flutter application using the **clean_framework** package. The application fetches user data and displays it on the screen, showcasing the separation of concerns and the clean architecture principles that the package promotes.

### Summary of Application Flow
- The application starts with the `main()` function, which initializes the `MyApp` widget.
- The `UserScreen` widget is built, where the `UserRepository` and `GetUserUseCase` are instantiated.
- The `UserViewModel` is created, and the `fetchUser()` method is called to retrieve user data.
- The UI listens for changes in the `UserViewModel` and updates accordingly when the user data is available.

This structured approach not only enhances code readability but also makes it easier to test and maintain the application as it grows.
