# Flutter App Badge Control: A Comprehensive Overview

The `flutter_app_badge_control` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to manage app badges across different platforms. App badges are small visual indicators, often seen on app icons, that notify users of new messages, updates, or alerts. This package provides a unified API to control these badges, making it easier to implement consistent notification experiences across both Android and iOS.

## When to Use `flutter_app_badge_control`

- **Notification Alerts**: Use this package to update app badges when new notifications arrive, ensuring users are aware of pending alerts.
- **Unread Messages**: Ideal for messaging apps to indicate unread messages directly on the app icon.
- **Task Reminders**: For productivity apps, badges can remind users of pending tasks or deadlines.

## Key Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Seamlessly manage app badges on both Android and iOS with a single codebase.
- **Simple API**: Provides an easy-to-use interface for setting, updating, and removing badges.
- **Customizable**: Allows developers to customize badge behavior based on app-specific requirements.

# Setting Up and Using `flutter_app_badge_control`

In this tutorial, we'll walk through the setup and usage of the `flutter_app_badge_control` package, covering platform-specific configurations for both Android and iOS.

## Installation

Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_app_badge_control: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Android Configuration

1. **Modify `AndroidManifest.xml`**: Ensure your app has the necessary permissions to display badges. Add the following within the `<manifest>` tag:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="com.android.launcher.permission.INSTALL_SHORTCUT"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="com.android.launcher.permission.UNINSTALL_SHORTCUT"/>
   ```

2. **Badge Support**: Note that badge support on Android can vary by manufacturer. The package handles this internally, but testing on target devices is recommended.

## iOS Configuration

1. **Modify `Info.plist`**: Add the following key to request permission for badge notifications:

   ```xml
   <key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
   <array>
       <string>fetch</string>
       <string>remote-notification</string>
   </array>
   ```

2. **Enable Push Notifications**: Ensure your app is configured to receive push notifications, as badges are often updated in response to these.

## Using the Package

Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_app_badge_control/flutter_app_badge_control.dart';
```

### Basic Usage

- **Set Badge**: To set a badge count, use:

  ```dart
  RealFlutter.setBadgeCount(5);
  ```

- **Clear Badge**: To clear the badge, use:

  ```dart
  RealFlutter.clearBadge();
  ```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_app_badge_control/flutter_app_badge_control.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Badge Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: BadgeHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class BadgeHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _BadgeHomePageState createState() => _BadgeHomePageState();
}

class _BadgeHomePageState extends State<BadgeHomePage> {
  int _badgeCount = 0;

  // Function to increment the badge count
  void _incrementBadge() {
    setState(() {
      _badgeCount++;
    });
    RealFlutter.setBadgeCount(_badgeCount); // Update the badge count
  }

  // Function to clear the badge count
  void _clearBadge() {
    setState(() {
      _badgeCount = 0;
    });
    RealFlutter.clearBadge(); // Clear the badge
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Badge Control Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Badge Count: $_badgeCount',
              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline4,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _incrementBadge,
              child: Text('Increment Badge'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _clearBadge,
              child: Text('Clear Badge'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow:
// 1. The app starts with a main function that runs MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp and home page.
// 3. BadgeHomePage is a StatefulWidget that manages the badge count state.
// 4. _BadgeHomePageState contains two main functions: _incrementBadge and _clearBadge.
// 5. _incrementBadge increases the badge count and updates the app badge using RealFlutter.setBadgeCount.
// 6. _clearBadge resets the badge count to zero and clears the app badge using RealFlutter.clearBadge.
// 7. The UI consists of a text displaying the current badge count and two buttons to increment or clear the badge.
