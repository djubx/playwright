## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the `enough_ascii_art` package in scenarios such as:
- Creating retro-style games or applications that require a nostalgic feel.
- Designing terminal-like interfaces within your Flutter app.
- Adding fun and engaging visual elements to your app's UI.

## Features

- **Easy Integration**: The package can be easily added to any Flutter project with minimal setup.
- **Customizable**: You can customize the ASCII art output to fit your application's theme.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using enough_ascii_art

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `enough_ascii_art` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  enough_ascii_art: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to display ASCII art using the `enough_ascii_art` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:enough_ascii_art/enough_ascii_art.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('ASCII Art Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: AsciiArtWidget(
            asciiArt: '''
              .--.
             |o_o |
             |:_/ |
            //   \ \
           (|     | )
          /'\_   _/`\\
          \___)=(___/
            ''',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.black),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that displays ASCII art in the center of the screen.

# Complete Example of Using enough_ascii_art

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:enough_ascii_art/enough_ascii_art.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Start the application with the RealFlutter class
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'ASCII Art Demo', // Title of the application
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('ASCII Art Example'), // AppBar title
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: AsciiArtWidget(
            asciiArt: '''
              .--.
             |o_o |
             |:_/ |
            //   \ \  // ASCII art representation of a character
           (|     | )
          /'\_   _/`\\
          \___)=(___/
            ''',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.black), // Style for the ASCII art
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application, which calls runApp() with the RealFlutter class.
// 2. The RealFlutter class extends StatelessWidget and builds the main structure of the app.
// 3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp widget is created with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 4. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with a title and a body that centers the ASCII art on the screen.
// 5. The AsciiArtWidget is used to display the ASCII art, which is defined in the asciiArt property.
// 6. The style property allows customization of the text appearance, such as font size and color.
// 7. The application runs and displays the ASCII art in the center of the screen when launched.
