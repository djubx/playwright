# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `widget_toolkit_qr`

## Installation
To get started with the `widget_toolkit_qr` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  widget_toolkit_qr: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/widget_toolkit_qr).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to use the camera. Add the following lines inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you need to add a description for camera usage in your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the camera to scan QR codes.</string>
```

## Using the Package
Now that you have installed the package and configured your project, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to generate and scan QR codes.

# Complete Example of Using `widget_toolkit_qr`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:widget_toolkit_qr/widget_toolkit_qr.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'QR Code Example',
      home: QRHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class QRHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _QRHomePageState createState() => _QRHomePageState();
}

class _QRHomePageState extends State<QRHomePage> {
  String qrData = "https://flutter.dev"; // Data to encode in QR
  String scannedData = ""; // To hold scanned data

  // Function to scan QR code
  Future<void> scanQRCode() async {
    String result = await WidgetToolkitQR.scan(); // Scanning QR code
    setState(() {
      scannedData = result; // Update scanned data
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('QR Code Generator and Scanner'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display generated QR code
            WidgetToolkitQR.generate(
              data: qrData,
              size: 200.0,
              // Customizing QR code appearance
              foregroundColor: Colors.black,
              backgroundColor: Colors.white,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text('Scan Result: $scannedData'), // Display scanned result
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: scanQRCode, // Button to trigger QR scanning
              child: Text('Scan QR Code'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application that generates and scans QR codes.
// 1. The `main` function initializes the app and sets `RealFlutter` as the root widget.
// 2. `RealFlutter` is a stateless widget that builds the main MaterialApp with a title and home page.
// 3. `QRHomePage` is a stateful widget that manages the QR code generation and scanning.
// 4. The `qrData` variable holds the data to be encoded in the QR code, while `scannedData` stores the result of the scan.
// 5. The `scanQRCode` function uses the `WidgetToolkitQR.scan()` method to scan a QR code and updates the state with the scanned result.
// 6. The `build` method constructs the UI, displaying the generated QR code and a button to initiate scanning.
// 7. When the button is pressed, the `scanQRCode` function is called, allowing the user to scan a QR code and see the result displayed on the screen.
