# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_material_design_icons

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_material_design_icons` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_material_design_icons` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_material_design_icons: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_material_design_icons/flutter_material_design_icons.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using Icons in Your Application

You can now use the icons in your Flutter widgets. Here’s how to do it:

### Example for Android and iOS

The usage is the same across both platforms. Here’s a simple example of how to use an icon in a `Container` widget:

```dart
Container(
  child: Icon(
    FlutterMaterialDesignIcons.home, // Use the icon you want
    size: 50.0, // Set the size of the icon
    color: Colors.blue, // Set the color of the icon
  ),
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details

- **Android**: Ensure that your Android project is set up to use Material Design components. This is usually the default in Flutter projects.
- **iOS**: Similarly, ensure that your iOS project is configured correctly. The package works out of the box without additional configurations.

## Step 4: Customizing Icons

You can customize the icons further by adjusting their size, color, and other properties. For example:

```dart
Icon(
  FlutterMaterialDesignIcons.favorite,
  size: 40.0,
  color: Colors.red,
)
```

This will render a red heart icon with a size of 40.0.

By following these steps, you can easily integrate and use the `flutter_material_design_icons` package in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of flutter_material_design_icons

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_material_design_icons/flutter_material_design_icons.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Start the application with the RealFlutter widget
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Material Design Icons Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Material Design Icons'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying a home icon
              Icon(
                FlutterMaterialDesignIcons.home,
                size: 100.0, // Set the size of the icon
                color: Colors.blue, // Set the color of the icon
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Add space between icons
              // Displaying a favorite icon
              Icon(
                FlutterMaterialDesignIcons.favorite,
                size: 100.0,
                color: Colors.red,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Add space between icons
              // Displaying a settings icon
              Icon(
                FlutterMaterialDesignIcons.settings,
                size: 100.0,
                color: Colors.green,
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application, which calls runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a title and a home property, which is a Scaffold widget.
// 4. The Scaffold widget provides an AppBar with a title and a body that centers its content.
// 5. The body contains a Column widget that arranges its children vertically.
// 6. Inside the Column, we have three Icon widgets displaying different Material Design icons: home, favorite, and settings.
// 7. Each icon is customized with size and color properties, and SizedBox widgets are used to add spacing between them.
