# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the `checkout_screen_ui` Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `checkout_screen_ui` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  checkout_screen_ui: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the checkout screen.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:checkout_screen_ui/checkout_screen_ui.dart';
```

2. Create a new widget that uses the `CheckoutScreen` class provided by the package:

```dart
class CheckoutPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Checkout')),
      body: CheckoutScreen(
        // Add your checkout details here
        onCheckout: (paymentDetails) {
          // Handle the checkout process
          print('Payment Details: $paymentDetails');
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Finally, navigate to the `CheckoutPage` from your main application or any other page.

This setup will give you a basic checkout screen that you can further customize according to your needs.

# Complete Example of Using the `checkout_screen_ui` Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:checkout_screen_ui/checkout_screen_ui.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Checkout Example',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: CheckoutPage(),
    );
  }
}

class CheckoutPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Checkout')),
      body: CheckoutScreen(
        // Callback function to handle checkout
        onCheckout: (paymentDetails) {
          // Here you can handle the payment details
          print('Payment Details: $paymentDetails');
          // You can navigate to a success page or show a success message
          ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
            SnackBar(content: Text('Checkout Successful!')),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme, setting CheckoutPage as the home.
// 3. CheckoutPage displays a Scaffold with an AppBar and a CheckoutScreen.
// 4. The CheckoutScreen takes an onCheckout callback, which is triggered when the user completes the checkout process.
// 5. Inside the onCheckout callback, we print the payment details and show a SnackBar indicating success.
