Here's a detailed technical blog on the "observe_internet_connectivity" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Observe Internet Connectivity Flutter Package

The `observe_internet_connectivity` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to help developers monitor the internet connectivity status of their applications in real-time. This package is particularly useful for applications that require a stable internet connection to function correctly, such as social media apps, streaming services, or any app that relies on cloud data.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `observe_internet_connectivity` package in scenarios such as:

- **Real-time Data Applications**: Apps that need to fetch or send data continuously, like chat applications or live sports updates.
- **Offline Capabilities**: Applications that need to handle offline scenarios gracefully, providing users with feedback when connectivity is lost.
- **User Experience Enhancement**: Improving user experience by notifying users of connectivity changes, allowing them to take appropriate actions.

## Features

- **Real-time Connectivity Monitoring**: Automatically detects changes in internet connectivity status.
- **Platform Compatibility**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Customizable Callbacks**: Allows developers to define custom actions when connectivity changes.
- **Lightweight and Efficient**: Minimal performance overhead, ensuring smooth app performance.

By integrating this package, developers can create more robust applications that respond dynamically to changes in internet connectivity.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Observe Internet Connectivity Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `observe_internet_connectivity` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  observe_internet_connectivity: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open the `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open the `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key-value pairs to request permission for network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that the package is set up, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s how to implement it:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:observe_internet_connectivity/observe_internet_connectivity.dart';
```

2. Create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class and set up the connectivity listener:

```dart
class RealFlutter {
  final ConnectivityObserver _connectivityObserver = ConnectivityObserver();

  void init() {
    _connectivityObserver.onConnectivityChanged.listen((isConnected) {
      if (isConnected) {
        print("Connected to the internet");
      } else {
        print("Disconnected from the internet");
      }
    });
  }
}
```

3. Call the `init` method in your main application widget to start observing connectivity changes.

With these steps, you can effectively monitor internet connectivity in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using the Observe Internet Connectivity Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:observe_internet_connectivity/observe_internet_connectivity.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Internet Connectivity Observer',
      home: ConnectivityScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ConnectivityScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ConnectivityScreenState createState() => _ConnectivityScreenState();
}

class _ConnectivityScreenState extends State<ConnectivityScreen> {
  final ConnectivityObserver _connectivityObserver = ConnectivityObserver();
  String _connectionStatus = "Checking connectivity...";

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the connectivity observer
    _connectivityObserver.onConnectivityChanged.listen((isConnected) {
      // Update the connection status based on connectivity
      setState(() {
        _connectionStatus = isConnected ? "Connected" : "Disconnected";
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Connectivity Status'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          _connectionStatus,
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the observer when the widget is removed from the tree
    _connectivityObserver.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (ConnectivityScreen).
// 3. In ConnectivityScreen, we create a ConnectivityObserver instance to monitor connectivity changes.
// 4. In the initState method, we set up a listener for connectivity changes.
// 5. When the connectivity status changes, we update the _connectionStatus variable and rebuild the UI.
// 6. The build method displays the current connectivity status in the center of the screen.
// 7. When the widget is disposed, we clean up by disposing of the connectivity observer.
```
