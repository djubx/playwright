# Setting Up and Using DictionaryX

## Installation
To add the DictionaryX package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  dictionaryx: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to access the internet:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `Info.plist` to allow network requests:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the DictionaryX package, you can create a simple Flutter application that allows users to search for words. Hereâ€™s how to implement it:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:
   ```dart
   import 'package:dictionaryx/dictionaryx.dart';
   ```

2. Create an instance of the DictionaryX class and use its methods to fetch word data.

3. Implement a user interface that allows users to input words and display the results.

This setup will enable you to leverage the full capabilities of the DictionaryX package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using DictionaryX

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dictionaryx/dictionaryx.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'DictionaryX Example',
      home: DictionaryHome(),
    );
  }
}

class DictionaryHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DictionaryHomeState createState() => _DictionaryHomeState();
}

class _DictionaryHomeState extends State<DictionaryHome> {
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController();
  String _definition = '';

  // Function to fetch the definition of the word
  void _fetchDefinition() async {
    // Get the word from the text field
    String word = _controller.text;

    // Create an instance of DictionaryX
    DictionaryX dictionary = DictionaryX();

    // Fetch the definition using the word
    var result = await dictionary.getDefinition(word);

    // Update the state with the fetched definition
    setState(() {
      _definition = result['definition'] ?? 'No definition found';
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('DictionaryX Example'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              controller: _controller,
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Enter a word',
                suffixIcon: IconButton(
                  icon: Icon(Icons.search),
                  onPressed: _fetchDefinition, // Call fetch definition on press
                ),
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(
              _definition,
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and home set to DictionaryHome.
// 3. DictionaryHome is a stateful widget that manages the state of the word input and its definition.
// 4. The user enters a word in the TextField and presses the search icon.
// 5. The _fetchDefinition function is called, which retrieves the word from the controller.
// 6. An instance of DictionaryX is created, and the getDefinition method is called with the input word.
// 7. The fetched definition is then displayed on the screen.
// 8. If no definition is found, a default message is shown.
