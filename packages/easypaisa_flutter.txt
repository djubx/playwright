# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using easypaisa_flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `easypaisa_flutter` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `easypaisa_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  easypaisa_flutter: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
   ```

2. **Add Easypaisa SDK**: Ensure that the Easypaisa SDK is included in your project. This may involve adding specific dependencies or configurations as per the official documentation.

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. **CocoaPods**: Make sure to run `pod install` in the `ios` directory to install any necessary dependencies.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your Flutter application.

1. **Import the Package**:

   ```dart
   import 'package:easypaisa_flutter/easypaisa_flutter.dart';
   ```

2. **Initialize the Easypaisa Service**:

   You need to initialize the Easypaisa service in your application. This is typically done in the `main` function or the first screen of your app.

   ```dart
   void main() {
     runApp(MyApp());
     EasypaisaFlutter.initialize();
   }
   ```

3. **Creating a Payment**:

   You can create a payment request using the following method:

   ```dart
   void createPayment() async {
     var response = await EasypaisaFlutter.createPayment(
       amount: 100.0,
       phoneNumber: '03001234567',
       transactionId: 'txn12345',
     );

     if (response.success) {
       print('Payment Successful: ${response.transactionId}');
     } else {
       print('Payment Failed: ${response.errorMessage}');
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Handling Notifications**:

   To handle real-time notifications, you can set up a listener:

   ```dart
   EasypaisaFlutter.onTransactionStatusChanged.listen((status) {
     print('Transaction Status: $status');
   });
   ```

With these steps, you can successfully integrate and use the `easypaisa_flutter` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of easypaisa_flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:easypaisa_flutter/easypaisa_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
  // Initialize the Easypaisa service
  EasypaisaFlutter.initialize();
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Easypaisa Flutter Demo',
      home: PaymentScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PaymentScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PaymentScreenState createState() => _PaymentScreenState();
}

class _PaymentScreenState extends State<PaymentScreen> {
  String transactionStatus = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Listen for transaction status changes
    EasypaisaFlutter.onTransactionStatusChanged.listen((status) {
      setState(() {
        transactionStatus = status;
      });
    });
  }

  void createPayment() async {
    // Create a payment request
    var response = await EasypaisaFlutter.createPayment(
      amount: 100.0,
      phoneNumber: '03001234567',
      transactionId: 'txn12345',
    );

    // Check the response and update the UI accordingly
    if (response.success) {
      print('Payment Successful: ${response.transactionId}');
    } else {
      print('Payment Failed: ${response.errorMessage}');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Easypaisa Payment'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Transaction Status: $transactionStatus'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: createPayment,
              child: Text('Make Payment'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, initializing the Easypaisa service.
// 2. MyApp is the root widget, which builds the PaymentScreen.
// 3. In PaymentScreen, we listen for transaction status changes and update the UI.
// 4. When the "Make Payment" button is pressed, createPayment() is called.
// 5. createPayment() sends a payment request to Easypaisa and handles the response.
// 6. The transaction status is displayed on the screen, updating in real-time as notifications are received.
```
