For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

### Step 5: Customizing Icons

You can customize the icons by changing their size and color. Here’s an example:

# Complete Example of Using HugeIcons in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:hugeicons/hugeicons.dart'; // Importing the HugeIcons package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the RealFlutter app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'HugeIcons Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(), // Setting the home page to HomePage widget
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('HugeIcons Demo'), // Title of the app bar
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Displaying a home icon
            Icon(
              HugeIcons.home,
              size: 100.0, // Setting the size of the icon
              color: Colors.blue, // Setting the color of the icon
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
            // Displaying a settings icon
            Icon(
              HugeIcons.settings,
              size: 100.0, // Setting the size of the icon
              color: Colors.green, // Setting the color of the icon
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
            // Displaying a user icon
            Icon(
              HugeIcons.user,
              size: 100.0, // Setting the size of the icon
              color: Colors.red, // Setting the color of the icon
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of the MaterialApp is set to the HomePage widget.
// 4. The HomePage widget builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the icons vertically.
// 6. Each Icon widget uses HugeIcons to display different icons with specified sizes and colors.
// 7. The SizedBox widget is used to add spacing between the icons for better visual separation.
```
