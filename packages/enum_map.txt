// This is the main file for the Flutter app.
// It demonstrates the use of the enum_map package to map enums to values.
// In this example, we define an enum for different colors and create an enum map to map colors to hex codes.
// We then use the enum map to get the hex code for a specific color and display it on the screen.

// The app starts by running the main function, which creates a new instance of the MyApp widget.
// The MyApp widget is a stateless widget that returns a MaterialApp widget.
// The MaterialApp widget is the top-level widget for the app and provides a basic material design visual layout structure.

// The home property of the MaterialApp widget is set to the MyHomePage widget, which is a stateful widget.
// The MyHomePage widget returns a Scaffold widget, which provides a basic material design visual layout structure.
// The appBar property of the Scaffold widget is set to an AppBar widget, which displays a title and a navigation menu.
// The body property of the Scaffold widget is set to a Center widget, which centers its child widget horizontally and vertically.

// The child widget of the Center widget is a Column widget, which displays its child widgets in a vertical column.
// The mainAxisAlignment property of the Column widget is set to MainAxisAlignment.center, which centers the child widgets vertically.
// The children property of the Column widget is set to a list of two Text widgets.
// The first Text widget displays the text "Hex Code for Red:" in a font size of 24.
// The second Text widget displays the hex code for the color red in a font size of 48.

// The hex code for the color red is obtained by calling the getHexCode function and passing the color red as an argument.
// The getHexCode function returns the hex code for the specified color by looking it up in the colorMap.

// The colorMap is an enum map that maps colors to hex codes.
// It is created by calling the EnumMap constructor and passing a map of colors to hex codes as an argument.

// The EnumMap constructor creates a new enum map from the specified map of colors to hex codes.
// It uses the colors as keys and the hex codes as values.

// The enum map is used to look up the hex code for a specific color by calling the getHexCode function and passing the color as an argument.
// The getHexCode function returns the hex code for the specified color by looking it up in the colorMap.
