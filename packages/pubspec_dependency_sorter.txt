Here's a detailed technical blog on the "pubspec_dependency_sorter" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Description

The `pubspec_dependency_sorter` is a Flutter package designed to help developers manage and organize their `pubspec.yaml` dependencies efficiently. This package automates the sorting of dependencies, making it easier to maintain a clean and organized project structure. 

## When to Use This Package

- **Large Projects**: In projects with numerous dependencies, keeping the `pubspec.yaml` file organized can become cumbersome. This package helps in automatically sorting dependencies alphabetically.
- **Collaboration**: When multiple developers are working on a project, maintaining a consistent order of dependencies can reduce merge conflicts in the `pubspec.yaml` file.
- **Code Quality**: A well-organized `pubspec.yaml` file contributes to better readability and maintainability of the project.

## Features

- **Automatic Sorting**: Sorts dependencies in the `pubspec.yaml` file alphabetically.
- **Customizable Sorting**: Allows developers to specify custom sorting rules if needed.
- **Integration**: Easy to integrate into existing Flutter projects with minimal setup.

## Setup Process

To use the `pubspec_dependency_sorter` package, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the package under `dev_dependencies`:

   ```yaml
   dev_dependencies:
     pubspec_dependency_sorter: ^1.0.0
   ```

2. **Install the Package**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Usage**: You can use the package directly from the command line. Navigate to your project directory and run:

   ```bash
   dart pub run pubspec_dependency_sorter
   ```

### Platform-Specific Details

- **Android**: Ensure that your Android project is set up correctly with the necessary permissions. The package does not require any specific Android configurations.
  
- **iOS**: For iOS, ensure that your project is using the latest version of Xcode. The package does not require any specific iOS configurations.

### Configuration and Optimizations

- **Custom Sorting**: If you want to implement custom sorting, you can create a configuration file where you define your sorting rules. Refer to the package documentation for more details on how to set this up.

- **Continuous Integration**: Consider integrating the sorting command into your CI/CD pipeline to ensure that your `pubspec.yaml` file remains organized automatically.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pubspec_dependency_sorter/pubspec_dependency_sorter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Pubspec Dependency Sorter Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Dependency Sorter Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Call the sorting function when the button is pressed
              sortDependencies();
            },
            child: Text('Sort Dependencies'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to sort dependencies in pubspec.yaml
  void sortDependencies() {
    // This function uses the pubspec_dependency_sorter package to sort dependencies
    final sorter = PubspecDependencySorter();
    
    // Load the current pubspec.yaml file
    sorter.loadPubspec();

    // Sort the dependencies
    sorter.sort();

    // Save the sorted pubspec.yaml file
    sorter.savePubspec();
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget with an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the sortDependencies function is called.
// 5. The sortDependencies function creates an instance of PubspecDependencySorter.
// 6. It loads the current pubspec.yaml file, sorts the dependencies, and saves the updated file.
// 7. The user can see the changes in the pubspec.yaml file after sorting.
