# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the otp_pin_field Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `otp_pin_field` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  otp_pin_field: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` file to include any necessary permissions, especially if you are using features that require user consent.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `otp_pin_field` in your app.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:otp_pin_field/otp_pin_field.dart';
```

2. Use the `OtpPinField` widget in your widget tree:

```dart
OtpPinField(
  length: 4, // Number of fields
  onChanged: (value) {
    // Handle the value change
    print("Current value: $value");
  },
  onCompleted: (value) {
    // Handle the completion of input
    print("OTP entered: $value");
  },
),
```

This basic setup will create a 4-digit OTP input field. You can customize it further by adjusting properties like `borderColor`, `filled`, and `fillColor`.

## Conclusion

The `otp_pin_field` package is a straightforward yet powerful tool for implementing OTP input fields in Flutter applications. With its customizable features and easy integration, it can significantly enhance the user experience in your app.

# Complete Example of Using otp_pin_field

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:otp_pin_field/otp_pin_field.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'OTP Pin Field Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: OtpScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class OtpScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _OtpScreenState createState() => _OtpScreenState();
}

class _OtpScreenState extends State<OtpScreen> {
  String otp = ""; // Variable to hold the OTP value

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Enter OTP'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display the OTP input field
            OtpPinField(
              length: 4, // Set the number of fields to 4
              onChanged: (value) {
                // Update the OTP variable as the user types
                setState(() {
                  otp = value;
                });
              },
              onCompleted: (value) {
                // Handle the completion of OTP input
                print("OTP entered: $value");
                // You can add further logic here, like verifying the OTP
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to submit the OTP
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Logic to verify the OTP
                print("Verifying OTP: $otp");
              },
              child: Text('Verify OTP'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The OtpScreen widget is displayed, containing an OTP input field and a button.
// 3. The OtpPinField widget allows the user to input a 4-digit OTP.
// 4. As the user types, the onChanged callback updates the otp variable.
// 5. When the user completes the input, the onCompleted callback is triggered, allowing for further actions like verification.
// 6. The Verify OTP button prints the current OTP to the console, where you can implement your verification logic.
