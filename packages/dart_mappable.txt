Here's a detailed technical blog on the "dart_mappable" Flutter package, structured as requested.

# Dart Mappable: A Flutter Package for Easy Data Mapping

The `dart_mappable` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that simplifies the process of mapping data between Dart objects and various formats such as JSON. This package is particularly useful when working with APIs, as it allows for seamless serialization and deserialization of data models.

## When to Use `dart_mappable`

You should consider using `dart_mappable` in scenarios where:
- You need to convert complex Dart objects to JSON and vice versa.
- You are working with APIs that require specific data formats.
- You want to reduce boilerplate code associated with manual serialization/deserialization.

## Key Features
- **Automatic Mapping**: Automatically maps Dart objects to JSON and back, reducing the need for manual coding.
- **Type Safety**: Ensures type safety during the mapping process, minimizing runtime errors.
- **Customizable**: Allows for customization of the mapping process, enabling developers to define how specific fields should be handled.
- **Support for Nested Objects**: Easily handles nested objects and collections, making it suitable for complex data structures.

By leveraging these features, developers can streamline their workflow and focus on building robust applications without getting bogged down by data mapping concerns.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `dart_mappable`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with `dart_mappable`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  dart_mappable: ^1.0.0
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Setting Up the Mappable Class

Create a Dart class that you want to map. For this example, we will create a class named `RealFlutter`.

```dart
import 'package:dart_mappable/dart_mappable.dart';

part 'real_flutter.mapper.dart'; // This is required for code generation

@MappableClass()
class RealFlutter {
  final String name;
  final int age;

  RealFlutter({required this.name, required this.age});
}
```

## Step 3: Code Generation

To enable code generation, you need to add the build_runner and dart_mappable_generator to your dev_dependencies in `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  build_runner: ^2.0.0
  dart_mappable_generator: ^1.0.0
```

Run the following command to generate the necessary mapping code:

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build
```

This will create a file named `real_flutter.mapper.dart` that contains the mapping logic for your `RealFlutter` class.

## Step 4: Using the Mappable Class

Now that you have set up your class and generated the mapping code, you can use it to serialize and deserialize data.

### Example of Serialization

```dart
void main() {
  final realFlutter = RealFlutter(name: 'Flutter Dev', age: 30);
  final json = realFlutter.toJson(); // Convert to JSON
  print(json); // Output: {name: Flutter Dev, age: 30}
}
```

### Example of Deserialization

```dart
void main() {
  final json = {'name': 'Flutter Dev', 'age': 30};
  final realFlutter = RealFlutter.fromJson(json); // Convert from JSON
  print(realFlutter.name); // Output: Flutter Dev
}
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

After making these changes, run `flutter clean` and then `flutter pub get` to ensure everything is set up correctly.

With these steps, you are now ready to use the `dart_mappable` package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Using `dart_mappable`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dart_mappable/dart_mappable.dart';

part 'real_flutter.mapper.dart'; // Required for code generation

@MappableClass()
class RealFlutter {
  final String name;
  final int age;

  RealFlutter({required this.name, required this.age});
}

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dart Mappable Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Dart Mappable Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: FutureBuilder<RealFlutter>(
            future: fetchRealFlutterData(), // Fetch data asynchronously
            builder: (context, snapshot) {
              if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                return CircularProgressIndicator(); // Show loading indicator
              } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
                return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}'); // Show error message
              } else {
                final realFlutter = snapshot.data!; // Get the data
                return Text('Name: ${realFlutter.name}, Age: ${realFlutter.age}'); // Display data
              }
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Simulate fetching data from an API
  Future<RealFlutter> fetchRealFlutterData() async {
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2)); // Simulate network delay
    final json = {'name': 'Flutter Dev', 'age': 30}; // Sample JSON data
    return RealFlutter.fromJson(json); // Deserialize JSON to RealFlutter object
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, a FutureBuilder is used to handle asynchronous data fetching.
// 4. The fetchRealFlutterData() function simulates an API call, returning a RealFlutter object after a delay.
// 5. While waiting for the data, a CircularProgressIndicator is displayed.
// 6. Once the data is fetched, it is displayed in the center of the screen, showing the name and age of the RealFlutter object.
