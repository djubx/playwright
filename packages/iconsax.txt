# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Iconsax in Flutter

## Step 1: Adding Iconsax to Your Project

To get started with Iconsax, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  iconsax: ^0.1.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing Iconsax

In your Dart file, import the Iconsax package:

```dart
import 'package:iconsax/iconsax.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using Iconsax Icons

You can now use Iconsax icons in your Flutter widgets. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use an icon in a `Container`:

```dart
Container(
  child: Icon(
    Iconsax.home, // Using the home icon from Iconsax
    size: 50.0,   // Setting the size of the icon
    color: Colors.blue, // Setting the color of the icon
  ),
)
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Customizing Icons

You can customize the icons further by changing their size and color dynamically based on your app's theme or user preferences. For example:

```dart
Icon(
  Iconsax.settings,
  size: 30.0, // Custom size
  color: Theme.of(context).primaryColor, // Using theme color
)
```

With these steps, you can easily integrate and use the Iconsax package in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Iconsax in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:iconsax/iconsax.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Iconsax Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Iconsax Flutter Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Displaying a home icon
            Icon(
              Iconsax.home,
              size: 100.0, // Setting the size of the icon
              color: Colors.blue, // Setting the color of the icon
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
            // Displaying a settings icon
            Icon(
              Iconsax.settings,
              size: 100.0, // Setting the size of the icon
              color: Colors.green, // Setting the color of the icon
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
            // Displaying a user icon
            Icon(
              Iconsax.user,
              size: 100.0, // Setting the size of the icon
              color: Colors.red, // Setting the color of the icon
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp has a title and a theme, and it sets HomeScreen as the home widget.
// 4. HomeScreen is a StatelessWidget that builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange three Iconsax icons vertically.
// 6. Each icon is displayed with a specific size and color, demonstrating the use of Iconsax icons in the app.
