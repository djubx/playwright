// The app starts by initializing the SkmNotificationListener package in the main function.
// The RealFlutter class is a stateful widget that requests notification permissions and listens for notifications in its initState method.
// When a notification is received, the app displays an alert dialog with the notification details.
// The user can dismiss the dialog by tapping the OK button.
// The app continues to listen for notifications in the background, displaying a new dialog for each notification received.
