# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_secure_file_storage

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `flutter_secure_file_storage` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_secure_file_storage: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you need to add the following to your `Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSFileProtectionComplete</key>
<true/>
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_secure_file_storage/flutter_secure_file_storage.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package
You can now create an instance of `FlutterSecureFileStorage` and use it to store and retrieve files securely.

### Example Usage
```dart
final secureFileStorage = FlutterSecureFileStorage();

// To write a file
await secureFileStorage.writeFile(
  fileName: 'secure_file.txt',
  data: 'This is a secure file content',
);

// To read a file
String content = await secureFileStorage.readFile('secure_file.txt');
print(content); // Outputs: This is a secure file content
```

With these steps, you can easily set up and use the `flutter_secure_file_storage` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example: Flutter Secure File Storage

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_secure_file_storage/flutter_secure_file_storage.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Secure File Storage Example',
      home: SecureFileStorageDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class SecureFileStorageDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SecureFileStorageDemoState createState() => _SecureFileStorageDemoState();
}

class _SecureFileStorageDemoState extends State<SecureFileStorageDemo> {
  final FlutterSecureFileStorage secureFileStorage = FlutterSecureFileStorage();
  String fileContent = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _readSecureFile(); // Read the secure file on initialization
  }

  // Method to write data to a secure file
  Future<void> _writeSecureFile() async {
    await secureFileStorage.writeFile(
      fileName: 'secure_file.txt',
      data: 'This is a secure file content',
    );
    _readSecureFile(); // Read the file after writing
  }

  // Method to read data from a secure file
  Future<void> _readSecureFile() async {
    String content = await secureFileStorage.readFile('secure_file.txt');
    setState(() {
      fileContent = content; // Update the UI with the file content
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Secure File Storage Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('File Content:'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(fileContent.isNotEmpty ? fileContent : 'No content found'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _writeSecureFile, // Write to the secure file
              child: Text('Write Secure File'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds the MaterialApp and sets SecureFileStorageDemo as the home widget.
// 3. In SecureFileStorageDemo, the _writeSecureFile method is called when the button is pressed.
// 4. This method writes a string to a secure file using the secureFileStorage instance.
// 5. After writing, it calls _readSecureFile to read the content of the file.
// 6. The content is displayed on the screen, updating the UI accordingly.
```
