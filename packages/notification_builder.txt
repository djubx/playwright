// This is the main entry point of the app.
// The NotificationBuilder is initialized here.
// The RealFlutter widget is the root of the app.

// The RealFlutter widget is a stateful widget.
// It contains an ElevatedButton that, when pressed, creates a notification and displays it.

// The notification is created using the NotificationBuilder class.
// The setTitle and setContent methods are used to set the title and content of the notification.

// The notification is then displayed using the NotificationManager class.
// The showNotification method is used to display the notification.

// This is a basic example of how to use the notification_builder package.
// You can customize the notification by using other methods provided by the NotificationBuilder class.
// You can also handle notification interactions by using the NotificationManager class.
