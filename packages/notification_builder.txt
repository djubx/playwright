# Setting Up and Using Notification Builder

## Installation
To get started with the `notification_builder` package, add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  notification_builder: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/notification_builder).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.VIBRATE"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request permission for notifications:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>fetch</string>
</array>
<key>NSUserNotificationUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires notification permissions to alert you.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `notification_builder` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:notification_builder/notification_builder.dart';
```

You can then create and display notifications using the `NotificationBuilder` class. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
NotificationBuilder(
  title: 'Hello!',
  body: 'This is a notification from your Flutter app.',
  onTap: () {
    // Handle notification tap
  },
).show();
```

This will create a basic notification with a title and body. You can customize it further by adding images, buttons, and more.

# Complete Example of Notification Builder

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:notification_builder/notification_builder.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Notification Builder Example',
      home: NotificationHome(),
    );
  }
}

class NotificationHome extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Notification Builder Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Trigger the notification when the button is pressed
            NotificationBuilder(
              title: 'New Message',
              body: 'You have received a new message!',
              onTap: () {
                // Action to perform when the notification is tapped
                print('Notification tapped!');
              },
            ).show();
          },
          child: Text('Show Notification'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget.
// 3. The NotificationHome widget is displayed, which contains a button.
// 4. When the button is pressed, a notification is created using NotificationBuilder.
// 5. The notification has a title and body, and an onTap action that prints a message to the console.
// 6. Tapping the notification will trigger the onTap action, allowing for further interaction.
