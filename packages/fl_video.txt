# Setting Up and Using the fl_video Package

## Installation
To get started with `fl_video`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  fl_video: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/fl_video).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions to allow video playback:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `fl_video` package, you can create a simple video player widget. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fl_video/fl_video.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Video Player Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: FlVideo(
          url: 'https://www.example.com/video.mp4', // Replace with your video URL
          autoPlay: true,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic video player that automatically plays a video from a specified URL.

# Complete Example of fl_video in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fl_video/fl_video.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Video Player',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Declare a variable to hold the video URL
  final String videoUrl = 'https://www.example.com/video.mp4'; // Replace with your video URL

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Video Player Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: FlVideo(
          url: videoUrl, // Set the video URL
          autoPlay: false, // Start with autoPlay set to false
          onVideoFinished: () {
            // Callback when the video finishes playing
            print('Video playback completed');
          },
          onError: (error) {
            // Handle any errors during playback
            print('Error occurred: $error');
          },
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          // Toggle play/pause when the button is pressed
          setState(() {
            // Logic to play or pause the video
          });
        },
        child: Icon(Icons.play_arrow), // Change icon based on state
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home as RealFlutter.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that manages the video playback state.
// 4. The FlVideo widget is initialized with a video URL and callbacks for events.
// 5. A FloatingActionButton is provided to control video playback.
// 6. When the button is pressed, it toggles the play/pause state of the video.
