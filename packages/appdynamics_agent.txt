# Tutorial: Setting Up the AppDynamics Agent Flutter Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `appdynamics_agent` package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `appdynamics_agent` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  appdynamics_agent: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

2. **Initialize the Agent**: In your `MainActivity.java` or `MainActivity.kt`, initialize the AppDynamics agent in the `onCreate` method:

   ```java
   import com.appdynamics.eumagent.runtime.Instrumentation;

   @Override
   protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
       super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
       Instrumentation.start(this);
   }
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. **Initialize the Agent**: In your `AppDelegate.swift`, initialize the AppDynamics agent:

   ```swift
   import AppDynamics

   @UIApplicationMain
   class AppDelegate: FlutterAppDelegate {
       override func application(
           _ application: UIApplication,
           didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?
       ) -> Bool {
           AppDynamics.start()
           return super.application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: launchOptions)
       }
   }
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Once the package is set up, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to track an event:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:appdynamics_agent/appdynamics_agent.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'AppDynamics Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('AppDynamics Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Track a custom event
            AppDynamics.trackEvent("Button Pressed", {"button": "example"});
          },
          child: Text('Press Me'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we track a custom event when the button is pressed. This data will be sent to AppDynamics for monitoring.

By following these steps, you can successfully integrate the `appdynamics_agent` package into your Flutter application and start monitoring its performance.

# Complete Example: AppDynamics Agent in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:appdynamics_agent/appdynamics_agent.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the AppDynamics agent before running the app
  AppDynamics.start();
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'AppDynamics Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('AppDynamics Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Track a custom event when the button is pressed
            AppDynamics.trackEvent("Button Pressed", {"button": "example"});
          },
          child: Text('Press Me'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the AppDynamics agent and runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter class builds the main MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The HomeScreen class creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a centered button.
// 4. When the button is pressed, a custom event is tracked using AppDynamics, sending data about the button press to the AppDynamics dashboard for monitoring.
```
