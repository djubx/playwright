# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Animated Dashed Circle

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the **animated_dashed_circle** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  animated_dashed_circle: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, make sure to set the platform version in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Animated Dashed Circle
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_dashed_circle/animated_dashed_circle.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Animated Dashed Circle Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: AnimatedDashedCircle(
          color: Colors.blue,
          dashLength: 10.0,
          gap: 5.0,
          animationDuration: Duration(seconds: 2),
          size: 100.0,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    home: RealFlutter(),
  ));
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that displays an animated dashed circle in the center of the screen. You can customize the `color`, `dashLength`, `gap`, and `size` properties to fit your design needs.

# Complete Example of Animated Dashed Circle

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_dashed_circle/animated_dashed_circle.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Animated Dashed Circle Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        // Centering the Animated Dashed Circle in the middle of the screen
        child: AnimatedDashedCircle(
          color: Colors.blue, // Color of the dashed circle
          dashLength: 10.0, // Length of each dash
          gap: 5.0, // Gap between dashes
          animationDuration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Duration of the animation
          size: 100.0, // Size of the dashed circle
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    home: RealFlutter(), // Running the RealFlutter widget
  ));
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. It runs the MaterialApp widget, which is the root of the app.
// 3. The RealFlutter class is defined as a StatelessWidget.
// 4. Inside the build method, a Scaffold widget is created, which provides the basic structure of the app.
// 5. An AppBar is added with the title 'Animated Dashed Circle Example'.
// 6. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget, which centers its child.
// 7. The AnimatedDashedCircle widget is created with customizable properties:
//    - color: Sets the color of the dashed circle.
//    - dashLength: Defines the length of each dash.
//    - gap: Specifies the space between dashes.
//    - animationDuration: Controls how long the animation lasts.
//    - size: Sets the overall size of the dashed circle.
// 8. The AnimatedDashedCircle will animate its dashes continuously, providing a visually appealing effect.
```
