Here's a detailed technical blog on the "moving_average" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Moving Average Flutter Package

The `moving_average` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed for developers who need to calculate moving averages in their applications. Moving averages are commonly used in data analysis, particularly in financial applications, to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends in data.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the `moving_average` package in scenarios such as:
- **Financial Applications**: Analyzing stock prices or market trends.
- **Data Visualization**: Smoothing out data points in graphs for better readability.
- **Sensor Data Analysis**: Filtering noise from sensor readings in IoT applications.

## Features

- **Simple API**: Easy to integrate and use within your Flutter applications.
- **Customizable**: Supports different types of moving averages, including simple and exponential moving averages.
- **Performance**: Optimized for performance, making it suitable for real-time data processing.

With these features, the `moving_average` package is an excellent choice for developers looking to implement moving average calculations in their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Moving Average Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `moving_average` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  moving_average: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Open the `Podfile` and uncomment the platform line, setting it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to calculate a moving average.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:moving_average/moving_average.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample data for moving average calculation
    List<double> data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
    
    // Calculate the moving average with a window size of 3
    List<double> movingAvg = MovingAverage.simple(data, windowSize: 3);

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Moving Average Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Moving Averages: $movingAvg'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we import the `moving_average` package, create a simple Flutter app, and calculate the moving average of a list of numbers.

# Complete Example of Moving Average in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:moving_average/moving_average.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample data for moving average calculation
    List<double> data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
    
    // Calculate the moving average with a window size of 3
    List<double> movingAvg = MovingAverage.simple(data, windowSize: 3);

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Moving Average Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Moving Averages: $movingAvg'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds the UI, which includes a MaterialApp and a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, we define an AppBar with the title 'Moving Average Example'.
// 4. In the body of the Scaffold, we calculate the moving average of a predefined list of numbers using the MovingAverage.simple method.
// 5. Finally, we display the calculated moving averages in the center of the screen using a Text widget.
```
