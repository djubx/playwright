# Overview of the "sha3" Flutter Package

The `sha3` Flutter package provides a simple and efficient way to compute SHA-3 hashes in your Flutter applications. SHA-3 is a cryptographic hash function that is part of the Secure Hash Algorithm family, designed to provide a high level of security for data integrity and authentication. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where data verification is crucial, such as in blockchain applications, secure communications, and data integrity checks.

## When to Use the `sha3` Package
- **Data Integrity**: When you need to ensure that data has not been altered during transmission.
- **Cryptographic Applications**: In applications that require secure hashing for passwords or sensitive data.
- **Blockchain Development**: For hashing transactions or blocks in a blockchain.

## Key Features
- **Multiple Hashing Algorithms**: Supports SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, and SHA3-512.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that integrates seamlessly with Flutter projects.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS without additional configuration.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the `sha3` Package

## Installation
To add the `sha3` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  sha3: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
The `sha3` package is designed to work out of the box on both Android and iOS. However, ensure that your Flutter environment is set up correctly for both platforms. No additional configurations are required for using the `sha3` package.

## Basic Usage
Hereâ€™s how to use the `sha3` package in your Flutter application:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:
   ```dart
   import 'package:sha3/sha3.dart';
   ```

2. Create an instance of the SHA3 class and compute the hash:
   ```dart
   void computeHash() {
     var sha3 = SHA3(256); // Choose SHA3-256
     sha3.update('Hello, World!'.codeUnits);
     var hash = sha3.digest();
     print(hash); // Output the hash
   }
   ```

This simple setup allows you to compute SHA-3 hashes easily in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Using the `sha3` Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sha3/sha3.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'SHA3 Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('SHA3 Hash Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: HashDisplay(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class HashDisplay extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HashDisplayState createState() => _HashDisplayState();
}

class _HashDisplayState extends State<HashDisplay> {
  String _hash = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _computeHash(); // Call the method to compute the hash when the widget initializes
  }

  void _computeHash() {
    // Create an instance of SHA3 with 256-bit output
    var sha3 = SHA3(256);
    // Update the SHA3 instance with the byte representation of the string
    sha3.update('Hello, World!'.codeUnits);
    // Compute the hash and convert it to a hexadecimal string
    var hash = sha3.digest();
    // Update the state with the computed hash
    setState(() {
      _hash = hash.map((byte) => byte.toRadixString(16).padLeft(2, '0')).join();
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Text(
      'SHA3-256 Hash: $_hash', // Display the computed hash
      style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
// The application starts by running the RealFlutter class.
// The RealFlutter class builds a MaterialApp with a title and a simple Scaffold.
// Inside the Scaffold, we have an AppBar and a centered HashDisplay widget.
// The HashDisplay widget is a StatefulWidget that computes the SHA3 hash of the string "Hello, World!".
// In the initState method, we call _computeHash to perform the hashing operation.
// The _computeHash method creates a SHA3 instance, updates it with the byte representation of the string,
// and computes the hash. The resulting hash is then converted to a hexadecimal string and displayed on the screen.
// The computed hash is shown in the center of the screen as a Text widget.
```
