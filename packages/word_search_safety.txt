# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Word Search Safety Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **word_search_safety** package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **word_search_safety** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  word_search_safety: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` file to allow network requests. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the word search functionality.

# Complete Example of Using the Word Search Safety Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:word_search_safety/word_search_safety.dart'; // Import the package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the main application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Word Search Safety Example',
      home: WordSearchScreen(), // Navigate to the Word Search Screen
    );
  }
}

class WordSearchScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _WordSearchScreenState createState() => _WordSearchScreenState();
}

class _WordSearchScreenState extends State<WordSearchScreen> {
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController(); // Controller for text input
  final WordSearchSafety _wordSearch = WordSearchSafety(); // Initialize the word search safety instance
  String _result = ''; // Variable to hold the result of the filtering

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Word Search Safety'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              controller: _controller, // Bind the controller to the text field
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Enter text', // Label for the text field
                border: OutlineInputBorder(),
              ),
              onChanged: (value) {
                // When the text changes, filter the input
                setState(() {
                  _result = _wordSearch.filter(value); // Filter the input text
                });
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(
              'Filtered Result: $_result', // Display the filtered result
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget sets up a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The WordSearchScreen widget is created, which contains a text field for user input.
// 4. As the user types in the text field, the onChanged callback is triggered.
// 5. The input text is passed to the WordSearchSafety instance for filtering.
// 6. The filtered result is displayed below the text field, updating in real-time as the user types.
```
