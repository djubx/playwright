# Fast UI Kit: Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fast_ui_kit/fast_ui_kit.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Fast UI Kit Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
        brightness: Brightness.light, // Light theme
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Fast UI Kit Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: FastButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate to the details page when the button is pressed
            Navigator.push(
              context,
              MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => DetailsPage()),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Go to Details'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DetailsPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Details Page'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: FastCard(
          child: Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
            child: Text('This is the details page!'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a light theme and sets HomePage as the home widget.
// 3. HomePage displays a button in the center of the screen.
// 4. When the button is pressed, it navigates to the DetailsPage using Navigator.push.
// 5. DetailsPage shows a card with some text in the center of the screen.
