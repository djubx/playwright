# Progress Builder: A Comprehensive Overview

The `progress_builder` Flutter package is designed to simplify the process of managing and displaying progress indicators in your Flutter applications. It provides a flexible way to show loading states, success messages, and error notifications, making it easier for developers to enhance user experience during asynchronous operations.

## When to Use This Package
You should consider using `progress_builder` when:
- You need to display loading indicators while fetching data from an API.
- You want to show success or error messages based on the result of an operation.
- You are looking for a way to manage different states (loading, success, error) in a clean and efficient manner.

## Key Features
- **State Management**: Easily manage loading, success, and error states.
- **Customizable UI**: Customize the appearance of the progress indicators and messages.
- **Asynchronous Support**: Works seamlessly with Future and Stream-based operations.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in support for displaying error messages.

Overall, `progress_builder` is a powerful tool for enhancing the user experience in Flutter applications by providing clear feedback during data operations.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Progress Builder

## Installation
To add the `progress_builder` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  progress_builder: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/progress_builder).

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your app requires network access. Typically, no additional configuration is needed for using `progress_builder`.

## Basic Usage
To use the `progress_builder` package, you can wrap your asynchronous operations with the `ProgressBuilder` widget. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:progress_builder/progress_builder.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Progress Builder Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ProgressBuilder(
            future: fetchData(), // Your asynchronous function
            builder: (context, snapshot) {
              if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                return CircularProgressIndicator(); // Loading state
              } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
                return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}'); // Error state
              } else {
                return Text('Data: ${snapshot.data}'); // Success state
              }
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  Future<String> fetchData() async {
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2)); // Simulate network delay
    return 'Fetched Data'; // Simulated data
  }
}
```

In this example, the `ProgressBuilder` widget manages the loading, success, and error states based on the result of the `fetchData` function.

# Complete Example: Real Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:progress_builder/progress_builder.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Progress Builder Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Using ProgressBuilder to manage loading states
          child: ProgressBuilder(
            future: fetchData(), // Call to the asynchronous function
            builder: (context, snapshot) {
              // Check the connection state
              if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                // While waiting for data, show a loading indicator
                return CircularProgressIndicator();
              } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
                // If there is an error, display the error message
                return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}');
              } else {
                // On successful data fetch, display the data
                return Text('Data: ${snapshot.data}');
              }
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Simulated asynchronous function to fetch data
  Future<String> fetchData() async {
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2)); // Simulate network delay
    return 'Fetched Data'; // Return simulated data
  }
}

// The main function to run the app
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
3. Inside the Center widget, a ProgressBuilder is used to manage the state of the asynchronous fetchData function.
4. The fetchData function simulates a network call with a 2-second delay and returns a string.
5. The ProgressBuilder checks the connection state:
   - If waiting, it shows a CircularProgressIndicator.
   - If there's an error, it displays the error message.
   - If successful, it shows the fetched data.
6. This structure allows for a clean and efficient way to handle loading states in Flutter applications.
