# Overview of the apple_pencil_double_tap Flutter Package

The `apple_pencil_double_tap` Flutter package is designed to enhance the user experience for applications that utilize the Apple Pencil on iOS devices. This package allows developers to easily detect double-tap gestures made with the Apple Pencil, enabling a range of interactive features that can significantly improve the usability of drawing, note-taking, and design applications.

## When to Use This Package
- **Drawing Applications**: Implement features like switching tools or colors with a double-tap.
- **Note-Taking Apps**: Allow users to quickly toggle between writing and erasing modes.
- **Design Software**: Enable quick access to different design functions or layers.

## Key Features
- **Gesture Detection**: Seamlessly detects double-tap gestures from the Apple Pencil.
- **Customizable Actions**: Developers can define specific actions that occur on double-tap.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup process that integrates well with existing Flutter applications.

This package is particularly useful for developers looking to create intuitive and responsive applications that leverage the unique capabilities of the Apple Pencil.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using apple_pencil_double_tap

## Installation
To add the `apple_pencil_double_tap` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  apple_pencil_double_tap: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/apple_pencil_double_tap).

## Platform-Specific Details
### iOS Configuration
1. Ensure your project is set up for iOS development.
2. In your `Info.plist`, you may need to add permissions for using the Apple Pencil, although this is generally handled by default.

### Android Configuration
Currently, this package is primarily focused on iOS and does not support Android devices. Ensure your application gracefully handles scenarios where the Apple Pencil is not available.

## Using the Package
To use the `apple_pencil_double_tap` package, you will need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:apple_pencil_double_tap/apple_pencil_double_tap.dart';
```

You can then set up a listener for double-tap events in your widget tree. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _action = "Double-tap with Apple Pencil";

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the double-tap listener
    ApplePencilDoubleTap.onDoubleTap.listen((event) {
      setState(() {
        _action = "Double-tap detected!";
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Apple Pencil Double Tap")),
      body: Center(child: Text(_action)),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a listener for double-tap events and updates the UI accordingly.

# Complete Example of apple_pencil_double_tap

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:apple_pencil_double_tap/apple_pencil_double_tap.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _action = "Double-tap with Apple Pencil"; // Initial message

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the double-tap listener
    ApplePencilDoubleTap.onDoubleTap.listen((event) {
      setState(() {
        _action = "Double-tap detected!"; // Update message on double-tap
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Apple Pencil Double Tap")),
      body: Center(child: Text(_action)), // Display the action message
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the action message.
// 3. In the initState method, a listener is set up to listen for double-tap events from the Apple Pencil.
// 4. When a double-tap is detected, the state is updated, changing the action message to "Double-tap detected!".
// 5. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget displaying the current action message.
// 6. The UI updates automatically when the state changes, providing immediate feedback to the user.
