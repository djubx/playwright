# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Super Easy Permissions

## Installation
To add `super_easy_permissions` to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  super_easy_permissions: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/super_easy_permissions).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the necessary permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag. For example, to request camera and location permissions, include:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the required permissions with user-facing descriptions. For example:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to take photos.</string>
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your location for better service.</string>
```

## Using the Package
To use the package, import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:super_easy_permissions/super_easy_permissions.dart';
```

You can then check and request permissions as follows:

```dart
void checkAndRequestPermissions() async {
  // Check if the camera permission is granted
  var cameraStatus = await SuperEasyPermissions.checkPermission(Permission.camera);
  
  if (cameraStatus != PermissionStatus.granted) {
    // Request camera permission
    var result = await SuperEasyPermissions.requestPermission(Permission.camera);
    if (result == PermissionStatus.granted) {
      print("Camera permission granted");
    } else {
      print("Camera permission denied");
    }
  }
}
```

This function checks if the camera permission is granted and requests it if not. You can implement similar logic for other permissions as needed.

# Complete Example: Using Super Easy Permissions in a Flutter App

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:super_easy_permissions/super_easy_permissions.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Super Easy Permissions Demo',
      home: PermissionHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class PermissionHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PermissionHomePageState createState() => _PermissionHomePageState();
}

class _PermissionHomePageState extends State<PermissionHomePage> {
  String _permissionStatus = "Unknown";

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Check permissions when the app starts
    checkAndRequestPermissions();
  }

  void checkAndRequestPermissions() async {
    // Check if the camera permission is granted
    var cameraStatus = await SuperEasyPermissions.checkPermission(Permission.camera);
    
    if (cameraStatus != PermissionStatus.granted) {
      // Request camera permission
      var result = await SuperEasyPermissions.requestPermission(Permission.camera);
      if (result == PermissionStatus.granted) {
        setState(() {
          _permissionStatus = "Camera permission granted";
        });
      } else {
        setState(() {
          _permissionStatus = "Camera permission denied";
        });
      }
    } else {
      setState(() {
        _permissionStatus = "Camera permission already granted";
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Permissions Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(_permissionStatus), // Display the permission status
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The PermissionHomePage widget is created, and its state is initialized.
// 3. In the initState method, checkAndRequestPermissions is called to check the camera permission status.
// 4. If the permission is not granted, it requests the permission and updates the state based on the result.
// 5. The UI displays the current permission status to the user.
