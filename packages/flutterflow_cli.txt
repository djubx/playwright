# Setting Up and Using `flutterflow_cli`

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutterflow_cli` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter projects.

## Step 1: Installation

To get started, you need to install the `flutterflow_cli` package. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
dart pub global activate flutterflow_cli
```

This command installs the package globally, allowing you to use it from any directory.

## Step 2: Setting Up Your Flutter Project

1. **Create a New Flutter Project**:
   If you haven't already created a Flutter project, you can do so by running:

   ```bash
   flutter create my_flutter_app
   cd my_flutter_app
   ```

2. **Initialize FlutterFlow**:
   Inside your project directory, initialize FlutterFlow by running:

   ```bash
   flutterflow init
   ```

   This command sets up the necessary configurations for your FlutterFlow project.

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configurations

### For Android

1. **Update `android/app/build.gradle`**:
   Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Permissions**:
   If your app requires specific permissions, add them to the `AndroidManifest.xml` file located in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.

### For iOS

1. **Update `ios/Podfile`**:
   Ensure that your platform version is set to at least 10.0:

   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

2. **Permissions**:
   If your app requires specific permissions, add them to the `Info.plist` file located in `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.

## Step 4: Using `flutterflow_cli`

You can now use various commands provided by `flutterflow_cli`. Here are some common commands:

- **Generate Code**:
  To generate code for your FlutterFlow project, run:

  ```bash
  flutterflow generate
  ```

- **Build the Project**:
  To build your Flutter project, use:

  ```bash
  flutter build
  ```

- **Deploy the Project**:
  To deploy your project, run:

  ```bash
  flutterflow deploy
  ```

These commands will help you manage your FlutterFlow projects efficiently.

# Complete Example of Using `flutterflow_cli`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

// Main entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// The main widget of the application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'FlutterFlow CLI Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

// Home screen widget
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Welcome to FlutterFlow CLI!',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action when button is pressed
                showDialog(
                  context: context,
                  builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                    title: Text('Hello!'),
                    content: Text('This is a simple FlutterFlow CLI example.'),
                    actions: [
                      TextButton(
                        onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                        child: Text('Close'),
                      ),
                    ],
                  ),
                );
              },
              child: Text('Show Message'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to HomeScreen, which is the main screen of the app.
// 4. HomeScreen contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the text and button vertically.
// 6. When the button is pressed, an AlertDialog is displayed with a message.
// 7. The user can close the dialog by pressing the 'Close' button.
```
