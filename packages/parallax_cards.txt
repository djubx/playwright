# Setting Up and Using the Parallax Cards Package
=====================================================

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Pubspec.yaml File

```yml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  parallax_cards: ^1.0.0
```

### Step 2: Import the Package in Your Dart File

```dart
import 'package:parallax_cards/parallax_cards.dart';
```

### Step 3: Create a Parallax Card

```dart
ParallaxCard(
  child: Image.asset('assets/image.jpg'),
  parallaxEffect: ParallaxEffect(
    depth: 10.0,
    angle: 45.0,
  ),
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details

* For Android, make sure to add the following line to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:
```xml
<application
  ...
  android:hardwareAccelerated="true"
  ...
>
```
* For iOS, make sure to add the following line to your `Info.plist` file:
```xml
<key>UIHardwareAcceleration</key>
<true/>
```

### Required Configurations and Optimizations

* To achieve the best performance, make sure to use a `RepaintBoundary` widget as the parent of your `ParallaxCard` widget.
* You can also use a `CachedNetworkImage` widget to cache your images and improve performance.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:parallax_cards/parallax_cards.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Parallax Cards Demo',
      home: ParallaxCardsDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class ParallaxCardsDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ParallaxCardsDemoState createState() => _ParallaxCardsDemoState();
}

class _ParallaxCardsDemoState extends State<ParallaxCardsDemo> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Parallax Cards Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: RepaintBoundary(
          child: ParallaxCard(
            child: Image.asset('assets/image.jpg'),
            parallaxEffect: ParallaxEffect(
              depth: 10.0,
              angle: 45.0,
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a Material app with a title and a home screen.
// 2. The home screen is a stateful widget that builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 3. The body of the Scaffold is a Center widget that contains a RepaintBoundary widget.
// 4. The RepaintBoundary widget is used to improve performance by caching the child widget.
// 5. The child widget of the RepaintBoundary is a ParallaxCard widget.
// 6. The ParallaxCard widget is created with a child widget (in this case, an Image widget) and a parallax effect.
// 7. The parallax effect is created with a depth and angle, which determines the amount of parallax effect applied to the child widget.
// 8. When the user interacts with the app (e.g., scrolls or tilts the device), the parallax effect is applied to the child widget, creating a visually appealing and interactive effect.

// In summary, the code flows as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a Material app.
// 2. The app builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 3. The body of the Scaffold is a Center widget that contains a RepaintBoundary widget.
// 4. The RepaintBoundary widget caches the child widget (a ParallaxCard widget).
// 5. The ParallaxCard widget applies a parallax effect to its child widget (an Image widget).
// 6. The user interacts with the app, causing the parallax effect to be applied to the child widget.
