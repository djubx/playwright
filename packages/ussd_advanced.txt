# USSD Advanced Flutter Package
The `ussd_advanced` Flutter package provides a simple and efficient way to interact with USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) services in Flutter applications. USSD is a protocol used by mobile network operators to provide various services such as mobile money, airtime top-up, and more.

This package is ideal for developers who want to integrate USSD services into their Flutter applications, providing users with a seamless and intuitive experience.

Key Features:

*   Supports both Android and iOS platforms
*   Easy to use and integrate into existing Flutter applications
*   Provides a simple and efficient way to interact with USSD services

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the USSD Advanced Package

## Step 1: Add the Package to Your Flutter Project

To use the `ussd_advanced` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under the `dependencies` section:

```yml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ussd_advanced: ^latest_version
```

Replace `latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on pub.dev.

## Step 2: Import the Package

After adding the package to your project, you need to import it into your Dart file. Add the following line at the top of your file:

```dart
import 'package:ussd_advanced/ussd_advanced.dart';
```

## Step 3: Request USSD Permissions (Android Only)

On Android, you need to request permission to access USSD services. You can do this by adding the following code to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CALL_PHONE" />
```

## Step 4: Use the USSD Advanced Package

To use the package, you need to create an instance of the `UssdAdvanced` class and call the `sendUssd` method. Here's an example:

```dart
UssdAdvanced ussdAdvanced = UssdAdvanced();
ussdAdvanced.sendUssd(code: '*123#', subscriptionId: 1);
```

Replace `*123#` with the USSD code you want to send, and `1` with the subscription ID of the SIM card you want to use.

                  if (_formKey.currentState!.validate()) {
                    UssdAdvanced ussdAdvanced = UssdAdvanced();
                    ussdAdvanced.sendUssd(
                      code: _ussdCodeController.text,
                      subscriptionId: int.parse(_subscriptionIdController.text),
                    );
                  }
                },
                child: Text('Send USSD'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user enters a USSD code and subscription ID in the text fields.
// 2. The user clicks the "Send USSD" button.
// 3. The _formKey.currentState!.validate() method is called to validate the form.
// 4. If the form is valid, a new instance of the UssdAdvanced class is created.
// 5. The sendUssd method is called with the USSD code and subscription ID as arguments.
// 6. The USSD code is sent to the mobile network operator.
// 7. The response from the mobile network operator is received and processed.

// In summary, this code provides a simple and efficient way to interact with USSD services in Flutter applications.
// It allows users to enter a USSD code and subscription ID, and then sends the USSD code to the mobile network operator.
// The response from the mobile network operator is received and processed, providing a seamless and intuitive experience for the user.
