# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Dart Emoji Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `dart_emoji` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dart_emoji: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to display emojis in a `Text` widget.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dart_emoji/dart_emoji.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Dart Emoji Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(
            Emoji.byName('smile').code, // Displaying a smile emoji
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 50),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we import the `dart_emoji` package and use it to display a smile emoji in the center of the screen.

# Complete Example of Using Dart Emoji

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dart_emoji/dart_emoji.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Dart Emoji Example'),
        ),
        body: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Displaying a smile emoji
            Text(
              Emoji.byName('smile').code,
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 50),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between emojis
            // Displaying a heart emoji
            Text(
              Emoji.byName('heart').code,
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 50),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between emojis
            // Displaying a thumbs up emoji
            Text(
              Emoji.byName('thumbs_up').code,
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 50),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The runApp function initializes the Flutter app with the RealFlutter widget.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 4. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Dart Emoji Example'.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold is a Column widget that centers its children.
// 6. Inside the Column, we display three emojis: a smile, a heart, and a thumbs up.
// 7. Each emoji is displayed using a Text widget, with a specified font size for visibility.
// 8. SizedBox widgets are used to add space between the emojis for better layout.
```
