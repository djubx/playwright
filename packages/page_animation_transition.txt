# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `page_animation_transition`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `page_animation_transition` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  page_animation_transition: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

To use the `page_animation_transition` package, you will typically wrap your navigation calls with the provided transition methods. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a page transition:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:page_animation_transition/page_animation_transition.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: FirstPage(),
    );
  }
}

class FirstPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('First Page')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate to the second page with a custom transition
            Navigator.of(context).push(
              PageAnimationTransition(
                page: SecondPage(),
                type: PageAnimationType.fade, // Choose your animation type
              ),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Go to Second Page'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SecondPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Second Page')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Welcome to the Second Page!')),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button on the `FirstPage` is pressed, it navigates to `SecondPage` with a fade transition.

# Complete Example of `page_animation_transition`

import 'package:page_animation_transition/page_animation_transition.dart';

  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Page Animation Transition Example',
      home: FirstPage(),
    );
  }
}

class FirstPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('First Page')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate to the second page with a custom transition
            Navigator.of(context).push(
              PageAnimationTransition(
                page: SecondPage(),
                type: PageAnimationType.fade, // Choose your animation type
              ),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Go to Second Page'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SecondPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Second Page')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Welcome to the Second Page!')),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The home property of MaterialApp is set to FirstPage, which is the initial screen.
// 3. In FirstPage, there is a button that, when pressed, triggers navigation to SecondPage.
// 4. The navigation uses PageAnimationTransition to apply a fade animation during the transition.
// 5. SecondPage displays a simple message and has its own AppBar.
// 6. The user can navigate back using the back button in the AppBar, which will use the default transition.
