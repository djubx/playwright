# Tutorial: Setting Up the Flutter Analog Clock Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_analog_clock` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, you need to add the `flutter_analog_clock` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_analog_clock: ^0.0.5  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install Packages
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Import the Package
In your Dart file where you want to use the analog clock, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_analog_clock/flutter_analog_clock.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Analog Clock Widget
You can now use the `AnalogClock` widget in your application. Here’s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
AnalogClock(
  decoration: BoxDecoration(
    color: Colors.white,
    shape: BoxShape.circle,
    boxShadow: [
      BoxShadow(
        color: Colors.black12,
        blurRadius: 10.0,
        spreadRadius: 2.0,
      ),
    ],
  ),
  width: 200.0,
  height: 200.0,
  showSecondHand: true,
  numberColor: Colors.black,
  showNumbers: true,
  textScaleFactor: 1.5,
  showTicks: true,
);
```

This code creates a simple analog clock with a white background, shadows, and visible second hand.

# Complete Example of Flutter Analog Clock

Here’s a complete example of a Flutter application that uses the `flutter_analog_clock` package. This example demonstrates how to create a simple app that displays an analog clock.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_analog_clock/flutter_analog_clock.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Analog Clock',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: ClockScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ClockScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Analog Clock Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: AnalogClock(
          decoration: BoxDecoration(
            color: Colors.white,
            shape: BoxShape.circle,
            boxShadow: [
              BoxShadow(
                color: Colors.black12,
                blurRadius: 10.0,
                spreadRadius: 2.0,
              ),
            ],
          ),
          width: 200.0, // Width of the clock
          height: 200.0, // Height of the clock
          showSecondHand: true, // Show the second hand
          numberColor: Colors.black, // Color of the numbers
          showNumbers: true, // Show numbers on the clock
          textScaleFactor: 1.5, // Scale factor for the numbers
          showTicks: true, // Show ticks on the clock
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp has a title and a theme, and it sets ClockScreen as the home widget.
// 4. ClockScreen is a StatelessWidget that builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. The Center widget contains the AnalogClock widget, which is configured with various properties.
// 6. The clock is displayed in the center of the screen with a white background, shadows, and visible numbers and ticks.
```
