# Setting Up flutter_gemini

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_gemini` package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

### Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_gemini` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_gemini: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml` if your application requires internet access:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

#### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions if needed:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

### Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your application.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter_gemini/flutter_gemini.dart';
   ```

2. Initialize the `RealFlutter` class and set up user authentication and data synchronization.

### Example Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the `flutter_gemini` package in your Flutter application:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Gemini Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}
```

This sets up a basic Flutter application using the `flutter_gemini` package.

## Part 3: Complete Example

<!-- START_MAIN -->
# Complete Example of flutter_gemini

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_gemini/flutter_gemini.dart'; // Importing the flutter_gemini package

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp()); // Starting the application
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Gemini Example',
      home: RealFlutter(), // Using the RealFlutter class as the home widget
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _data = ''; // Variable to hold the data from the server

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _initializeGemini(); // Initialize the flutter_gemini package
  }

  void _initializeGemini() {
    // Initialize the flutter_gemini package
    Gemini.initialize();

    // Set up a listener for data changes
    Gemini.onDataChanged((newData) {
      setState(() {
        _data = newData; // Update the state with new data
      });
    });

    // Simulate user authentication
    Gemini.authenticateUser('username', 'password').then((success) {
      if (success) {
        print('User authenticated successfully');
      } else {
        print('Authentication failed');
      }
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Gemini Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Data from server: $_data', // Displaying the data from the server
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which runs MyApp.
// 2. MyApp sets up a MaterialApp with RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that initializes the flutter_gemini package in its initState method.
// 4. The _initializeGemini method sets up data synchronization and user authentication.
// 5. When data changes on the server, the onDataChanged listener updates the _data variable.
// 6. The UI is rebuilt to display the latest data from the server.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

### Summary of Application Flow

The application begins execution in the `main()` function, which initializes the `MyApp` widget. The `MyApp` widget sets up a `MaterialApp` and uses the `RealFlutter` class as the home screen. 

In the `RealFlutter` class, the `initState` method is called, where the `flutter_gemini` package is initialized. The `_initializeGemini` method sets up a listener for data changes and simulates user authentication. When the data changes on the server, the listener updates the `_data` variable, triggering a rebuild of the UI to display the latest data.

This structure provides a clear and organized way to implement the `flutter_gemini` package in a Flutter application, showcasing its capabilities and ease of use.
