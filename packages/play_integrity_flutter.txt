In summary, the code flow is as follows:

1. The app initializes the Play Integrity package in the `initState` method.
2. When the user clicks the "Verify App Integrity" button, the app calls the `_verifyAppIntegrity` method.
3. The `_verifyAppIntegrity` method verifies the app integrity using the Play Integrity package.
4. If the app integrity is verified successfully, the app prints a success message to the console.
5. If the app integrity verification fails, the app prints a failure message to the console.
