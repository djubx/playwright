# Overview of the double_back_to_close Flutter Package

The `double_back_to_close` Flutter package is a simple yet effective tool designed to enhance user experience by providing a double-tap gesture to close the application. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where users might accidentally navigate away from an app or when they need a quick way to exit without using the back button.

## When to Use This Package

- **User Experience Enhancement**: When you want to prevent accidental exits from your app, especially in apps that require user engagement.
- **Custom Navigation**: In applications where the back button behavior needs to be customized, this package can provide a more intuitive way to exit.
- **Games and Interactive Apps**: For games or interactive applications where users might want to exit quickly without losing their progress.

## Features

- **Double Tap Detection**: The package listens for double-tap gestures to trigger the close action.
- **Customizable Behavior**: Developers can customize the behavior when the double-tap is detected, such as showing a confirmation dialog.
- **Lightweight**: The package is lightweight and easy to integrate into existing Flutter applications.

Overall, `double_back_to_close` is a valuable addition to any Flutter developer's toolkit, providing a straightforward solution for managing app exit behavior.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using double_back_to_close

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `double_back_to_close` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  double_back_to_close: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Basic Setup

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions. Typically, no special permissions are required for this package, but ensure your app's minimum SDK version is compatible.

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to ensure that your app supports the required iOS version. Open your `ios/Podfile` and set the platform version if necessary:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

To use the `double_back_to_close` package, wrap your main widget with the `DoubleBackToCloseApp` widget. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:double_back_to_close/double_back_to_close.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: DoubleBackToCloseApp(
        child: HomeScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Double Back to Close Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Press back twice to exit.'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `DoubleBackToCloseApp` widget wraps the `HomeScreen`, enabling the double back gesture to close the app.

## Step 4: Customizing Behavior

You can customize the behavior when the double back is detected. For instance, you can show a confirmation dialog:

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: DoubleBackToCloseApp(
        onWillPop: () async {
          return await showDialog(
            context: context,
            builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
              title: Text('Confirm Exit'),
              content: Text('Do you really want to exit the app?'),
              actions: [
                TextButton(
                  onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(false),
                  child: Text('No'),
                ),
                TextButton(
                  onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(true),
                  child: Text('Yes'),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ) ?? false;
        },
        child: HomeScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this customization, when the user double taps the back button, a confirmation dialog appears, allowing them to choose whether to exit the app or not.

With these steps, you can effectively integrate and customize the `double_back_to_close` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of double_back_to_close

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:double_back_to_close/double_back_to_close.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: DoubleBackToCloseApp(
        // This widget wraps the main screen and enables double back to close functionality
        onWillPop: () async {
          // Show a confirmation dialog when the user attempts to exit
          return await showDialog(
            context: context,
            builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
              title: Text('Confirm Exit'),
              content: Text('Do you really want to exit the app?'),
              actions: [
                TextButton(
                  onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(false), // User chooses not to exit
                  child: Text('No'),
                ),
                TextButton(
                  onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(true), // User chooses to exit
                  child: Text('Yes'),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ) ?? false; // Return false if dialog is dismissed without action
        },
        child: HomeScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Double Back to Close Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Press back twice to exit.'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp and wraps the HomeScreen with DoubleBackToCloseApp.
// 3. The onWillPop callback is triggered when the user attempts to exit the app.
// 4. A confirmation dialog is displayed, asking the user if they really want to exit.
// 5. If the user selects 'Yes', the app closes; if 'No', the dialog closes and the user remains in the app.
// 6. The HomeScreen displays a simple message instructing the user to press back twice to exit.
