# Tutorial: Setting Up Google Fonts in Flutter

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `google_fonts` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  google_fonts: ^2.3.1  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the `google_fonts` package:

```dart
import 'package:google_fonts/google_fonts.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using Google Fonts

You can now use Google Fonts in your Flutter widgets. Hereâ€™s how to apply a Google Font to a `Text` widget:

```dart
Text(
  'Hello, Google Fonts!',
  style: GoogleFonts.lato(
    textStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
  ),
)
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to ensure that your app supports the latest iOS versions. Update your `ios/Podfile` to include:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Optimizations

To optimize font loading, consider using the `GoogleFonts` class to cache fonts. This can improve performance, especially if you are using multiple fonts throughout your app.

```dart
Text(
  'Optimized Text',
  style: GoogleFonts.roboto(
    textStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
  ),
)
```

With these steps, you are now ready to use the `google_fonts` package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example: Using Google Fonts in a Flutter App

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:google_fonts/google_fonts.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Google Fonts Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text(
            'Google Fonts Demo',
            style: GoogleFonts.pacifico(fontSize: 24),
          ),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text(
                'Hello, Google Fonts!',
                style: GoogleFonts.lato(
                  textStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
                ),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              Text(
                'This is a sample text using Roboto.',
                style: GoogleFonts.roboto(
                  textStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
                ),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              Text(
                'Enjoy customizing your fonts!',
                style: GoogleFonts.openSans(
                  textStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 18, fontStyle: FontStyle.italic),
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp has a title and a theme defined.
// 4. The home property is set to a Scaffold, which provides the basic structure of the app.
// 5. An AppBar is created with a title styled using the Pacifico font from Google Fonts.
// 6. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child widgets.
// 7. A Column widget is used to arrange multiple Text widgets vertically.
// 8. Each Text widget uses a different Google Font (Lato, Roboto, Open Sans) to demonstrate the package's capabilities.
// 9. SizedBox widgets are used to add spacing between the text elements for better readability.
