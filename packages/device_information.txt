# Device Information Flutter Package

The `device_information` Flutter package is a powerful tool that allows developers to retrieve detailed information about the device on which their Flutter application is running. This package is particularly useful for applications that need to adapt their behavior based on the device's specifications, such as screen size, operating system version, and hardware capabilities.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the `device_information` package in scenarios such as:
- **Responsive Design**: Adapting UI elements based on device characteristics.
- **Feature Availability**: Enabling or disabling features based on device capabilities (e.g., camera availability).
- **Analytics**: Collecting device data for analytics purposes to understand user demographics better.

## Key Features
- Retrieve device model, manufacturer, and operating system details.
- Access screen dimensions and pixel density.
- Get information about the device's hardware capabilities, such as camera and sensors.
- Support for both Android and iOS platforms.

With these features, the `device_information` package provides a comprehensive solution for developers looking to enhance their applications with device-specific functionalities.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Device Information Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `device_information` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  device_information: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/device_information).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add specific permissions in your `Info.plist` file. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera for better experience.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library for better experience.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to retrieve and display device information.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:device_information/device_information.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Device Information Example')),
        body: DeviceInfoWidget(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DeviceInfoWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DeviceInfoWidgetState createState() => _DeviceInfoWidgetState();
}

class _DeviceInfoWidgetState extends State<DeviceInfoWidget> {
  String _deviceInfo = 'Fetching device information...';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _fetchDeviceInfo();
  }

  Future<void> _fetchDeviceInfo() async {
    // Fetch device information using the device_information package
    final deviceInfo = await DeviceInformation.getDeviceInfo();
    setState(() {
      _deviceInfo = deviceInfo.toString(); // Update the state with device info
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(
      child: Text(_deviceInfo), // Display the device information
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Device Information Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:device_information/device_information.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Device Information Example')),
        body: DeviceInfoWidget(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DeviceInfoWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DeviceInfoWidgetState createState() => _DeviceInfoWidgetState();
}

class _DeviceInfoWidgetState extends State<DeviceInfoWidget> {
  String _deviceInfo = 'Fetching device information...'; // Initial state message

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _fetchDeviceInfo(); // Call the method to fetch device info when the widget is initialized
  }

  Future<void> _fetchDeviceInfo() async {
    // Fetch device information using the device_information package
    final deviceInfo = await DeviceInformation.getDeviceInfo();
    setState(() {
      _deviceInfo = deviceInfo.toString(); // Update the state with device info
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(
      child: Text(_deviceInfo), // Display the device information
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which sets up the MaterialApp and Scaffold.
// 2. The AppBar displays the title "Device Information Example".
// 3. The body of the Scaffold contains the DeviceInfoWidget, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 4. In the DeviceInfoWidget, the _fetchDeviceInfo method is called in initState to retrieve device information.
// 5. The device information is fetched asynchronously using the DeviceInformation.getDeviceInfo() method.
// 6. Once the information is retrieved, the state is updated, and the device information is displayed in the center of the screen.
