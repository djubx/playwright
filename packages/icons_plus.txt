// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to HomePage, which is another StatelessWidget.
// 4. HomePage builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget containing a Column.
// 5. The Column displays three icons (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn) with specified sizes and colors.
// 6. SizedBox is used to add space between the icons for better visual separation.
