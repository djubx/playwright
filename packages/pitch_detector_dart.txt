# Pitch Detector Dart: A Flutter Package for Audio Pitch Detection

The **pitch_detector_dart** package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to implement audio pitch detection in their applications. This package leverages advanced algorithms to analyze audio signals and determine the pitch of musical notes or spoken words. It is particularly useful in applications related to music education, tuning instruments, or any scenario where pitch detection is essential.

## When to Use This Package
- **Music Applications**: For apps that help users learn to play instruments or tune their instruments.
- **Voice Analysis**: In applications that analyze speech patterns or vocal performances.
- **Games**: For interactive games that require sound-based feedback or challenges.

## Features
- **Real-time Pitch Detection**: Analyze audio input in real-time to provide immediate feedback.
- **Multiple Audio Sources**: Support for various audio input sources, including microphones and audio files.
- **Customizable Sensitivity**: Adjust the sensitivity of pitch detection to suit different use cases.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices.

With these features, the **pitch_detector_dart** package is a versatile choice for developers aiming to integrate audio pitch detection into their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Pitch Detector Dart Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **pitch_detector_dart** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the **pitch_detector_dart** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  pitch_detector_dart: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version
    }
}
```

2. Add microphone permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following key to request microphone access:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to the microphone for pitch detection.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that we have set up the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to implement pitch detection.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pitch_detector_dart/pitch_detector_dart.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _pitch = "Unknown"; // Variable to hold detected pitch
  PitchDetector? _pitchDetector; // Instance of PitchDetector

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _initializePitchDetector(); // Initialize pitch detector on startup
  }

  // Method to initialize the pitch detector
  void _initializePitchDetector() async {
    _pitchDetector = PitchDetector();
    await _pitchDetector!.start(); // Start the pitch detection
    _pitchDetector!.onPitchDetected.listen((pitch) {
      setState(() {
        _pitch = pitch.toString(); // Update the pitch variable
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _pitchDetector?.stop(); // Stop the pitch detector when disposing
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Pitch Detector")),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(
            "Detected Pitch: $_pitch", // Display the detected pitch
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the initState method, we initialize the PitchDetector instance.
// 3. The pitch detector starts listening for pitch data from the microphone.
// 4. When a pitch is detected, it updates the _pitch variable.
// 5. The UI is rebuilt to display the current detected pitch.
// 6. When the widget is disposed, the pitch detector is stopped to free resources.
```

## Summary
In this blog, we explored the **pitch_detector_dart** Flutter package, detailing its features and use cases. We walked through the setup process, including platform-specific configurations for Android and iOS. Finally, we provided a complete example of a Flutter application that demonstrates real-time pitch detection. The application flow was explained step-by-step through comments in the code, making it easy to understand how the package integrates into a Flutter app. This package opens up exciting possibilities for developers looking to create audio-related applications in Flutter.
