# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `nb_utils`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with `nb_utils`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  nb_utils: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the package to start using its features:

```dart
import 'package:nb_utils/nb_utils.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using `nb_utils` Features

You can now use various features provided by `nb_utils`. For example, to navigate to a new screen, you can use:

```dart
Navigator.push(context, MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => NewScreen()));
```

Or, to manage state, you can use the provided utilities to simplify your code.

### Example Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use `nb_utils` in a Flutter application:

```dart
// Example of using nb_utils for navigation and state management
```

By following these steps, you can effectively integrate `nb_utils` into your Flutter application and take advantage of its powerful features.

# Complete Example of Using `nb_utils`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:nb_utils/nb_utils.dart'; // Importing the nb_utils package

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp()); // Starting the application
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'nb_utils Example',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: HomeScreen(), // Setting the home screen
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home Screen')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigating to the DetailsScreen when the button is pressed
            Navigator.push(
              context,
              MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => DetailsScreen()),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Go to Details'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DetailsScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Details Screen')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('This is the details screen!'), // Displaying a message
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme, and specifies HomeScreen as the home widget.
// 3. HomeScreen displays a button that, when pressed, navigates to DetailsScreen using Navigator.push.
// 4. DetailsScreen shows a simple message indicating that the user has navigated to the details page.
```

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of `nb_utils` for navigation. The application consists of a home screen with a button that navigates to a details screen. The comments within the code explain each part of the application flow, making it easy to understand how the app works.
