# Platform Detect Package
The `platform_detect` package is a Flutter library that allows you to detect the platform on which your app is running. This can be useful in a variety of scenarios, such as when you need to implement platform-specific features or handle platform-specific issues.

## When to Use
You can use the `platform_detect` package in the following scenarios:

* When you need to implement platform-specific features, such as using a specific camera API on Android or using a specific payment gateway on iOS.
* When you need to handle platform-specific issues, such as dealing with different screen sizes or handling different types of notifications.
* When you need to detect the platform on which your app is running and perform actions accordingly.

## Features
The `platform_detect` package provides the following features:

* Detects the platform on which your app is running (Android, iOS, or Web).
* Provides a simple API for checking the platform.
* Works on both mobile and web platforms.

# Setting Up the Package
To use the `platform_detect` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Here's how you can do it:

```yml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  platform_detect: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to get the package.

## Using the Package
To use the package, you need to import it in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:platform_detect/platform_detect.dart';
```

You can then use the `Platform` class to detect the platform:

```dart
if (Platform.isAndroid) {
  // Android-specific code
} else if (Platform.isIOS) {
  // iOS-specific code
} else if (Platform.isWeb) {
  // Web-specific code
}
```

### Platform-Specific Details
Here are some platform-specific details to keep in mind:

* **Android**: On Android, the `Platform` class uses the `android.os.Build` class to detect the platform.
* **iOS**: On iOS, the `Platform` class uses the `UIDevice` class to detect the platform.
* **Web**: On the web, the `Platform` class uses the `window.navigator` object to detect the platform.

### Configurations and Optimizations
Here are some configurations and optimizations you can make:

* **Android**: You can add the following code to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file to optimize the package:

```xml
<uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="21" android:targetSdkVersion="29" />
```

* **iOS**: You can add the following code to your `Info.plist` file to optimize the package:

```xml
<key>MinimumOSVersion</key>
<string>11.0</string>
```

// The app starts by running the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// The MyApp widget builds the MaterialApp, which is the root widget of the app.
// The MaterialApp has a title, theme, and home property, which is set to the MyHomePage widget.
// The MyHomePage widget is a stateful widget that detects the platform when it starts.
// The platform is detected using the Platform class, which is a part of the platform_detect package.
// The detected platform is then displayed on the screen using a Text widget.
