Here's a detailed technical blog on the "buildcondition" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# BuildCondition Flutter Package

The **buildcondition** package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that allows for conditional widget rendering based on various conditions. This package simplifies the process of displaying different widgets based on specific criteria, making it easier to manage complex UI states without cluttering the code with multiple if-else statements.

## When to Use BuildCondition

You might want to use the **buildcondition** package in scenarios such as:
- **Dynamic UI**: When your UI needs to change based on user input or data fetched from an API.
- **Feature Flags**: To enable or disable features in your app based on user roles or app states.
- **Loading States**: To show loading indicators or error messages based on the state of data fetching.

## Features

- **Simple Syntax**: The package provides a clean and straightforward syntax for conditional rendering.
- **Multiple Conditions**: You can easily handle multiple conditions and render different widgets accordingly.
- **Integration with Flutter's Widget Tree**: It seamlessly integrates with Flutter's widget tree, allowing for efficient rendering.

## Example Usage

Here’s a simple example of how you might use the **buildcondition** package:

```dart
import 'package:buildcondition/buildcondition.dart';

BuildCondition(
  condition: isLoading,
  builder: (context) => CircularProgressIndicator(),
  fallback: (context) => Text('Data Loaded'),
);
```

In this example, if `isLoading` is true, a loading spinner is displayed; otherwise, a text widget is shown.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using BuildCondition

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the **buildcondition** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  buildcondition: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the package, import it:

```dart
import 'package:buildcondition/buildcondition.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using BuildCondition

You can now use the **BuildCondition** widget in your Flutter application. Here’s how to implement it in a simple app:

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, make sure your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Example Implementation

You can now implement the **BuildCondition** widget in your app. Here’s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:buildcondition/buildcondition.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final bool isLoading = false; // Change this to true to see the loading indicator

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('BuildCondition Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: BuildCondition(
          condition: isLoading,
          builder: (context) => CircularProgressIndicator(),
          fallback: (context) => Text('Data Loaded'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the app displays a loading indicator if `isLoading` is true; otherwise, it shows a text message.

# Complete Example of BuildCondition

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart'; // Importing Flutter material package
import 'package:buildcondition/buildcondition.dart'; // Importing the buildcondition package

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp()); // Entry point of the application
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: HomeScreen(), // Setting HomeScreen as the home widget
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final bool isLoading = false; // This variable controls the loading state

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('BuildCondition Example')), // AppBar with title
      body: Center(
        child: BuildCondition(
          condition: isLoading, // Condition to check if loading
          builder: (context) => CircularProgressIndicator(), // Widget to show when loading
          fallback: (context) => Text('Data Loaded'), // Widget to show when not loading
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with HomeScreen as the home widget.
// 3. HomeScreen contains a boolean variable 'isLoading'.
// 4. In the build method of HomeScreen, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. The BuildCondition widget checks the 'isLoading' variable.
// 6. If 'isLoading' is true, it displays a CircularProgressIndicator.
// 7. If 'isLoading' is false, it displays the text 'Data Loaded'.
// 8. This allows for dynamic UI updates based on the loading state.
```

In summary, the **buildcondition** package provides a clean and efficient way to manage conditional rendering in Flutter applications. By following the setup and implementation steps outlined above, you can easily integrate this package into your projects, enhancing your app's responsiveness and user experience.
