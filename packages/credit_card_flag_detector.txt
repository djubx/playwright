  credit_card_flag_detector: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:credit_card_flag_detector/credit_card_flag_detector.dart';
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` if you are accessing any sensitive data. However, for this package, no specific permissions are required.

## Step 4: Using the Package
You can use the `CreditCardFlagDetector` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:credit_card_flag_detector/credit_card_flag_detector.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Credit Card Flag Detector')),
        body: CreditCardInput(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class CreditCardInput extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CreditCardInputState createState() => _CreditCardInputState();
}

class _CreditCardInputState extends State<CreditCardInput> {
  String cardNumber = '';
  String cardFlag = '';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
      child: Column(
        children: [
          TextField(
            decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter Card Number'),
            onChanged: (value) {
              setState(() {
                cardNumber = value;
                cardFlag = CreditCardFlagDetector.getCardFlag(cardNumber);
              });
            },
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20),
          Text(
            'Detected Card: $cardFlag',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Credit Card Flag Detector

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:credit_card_flag_detector/credit_card_flag_detector.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Credit Card Flag Detector')),
        body: CreditCardInput(),
      );
    };
  }
}

class CreditCardInput extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CreditCardInputState createState() => _CreditCardInputState();
}

class _CreditCardInputState extends State<CreditCardInput> {
  String cardNumber = ''; // Variable to hold the card number input
  String cardFlag = ''; // Variable to hold the detected card flag

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0), // Padding around the input field
      child: Column(
        children: [
          TextField(
            decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter Card Number'), // Label for the input field
            onChanged: (value) {
              setState(() {
                cardNumber = value; // Update card number as user types
                cardFlag = CreditCardFlagDetector.getCardFlag(cardNumber); // Detect card flag
              });
            },
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between input and output
          Text(
            'Detected Card: $cardFlag', // Display the detected card flag
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20), // Style for the output text
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which sets up the MaterialApp and Scaffold.
// 2. The CreditCardInput widget is displayed in the body of the Scaffold.
// 3. Inside CreditCardInput, a TextField is provided for the user to enter their card number.
// 4. As the user types, the onChanged callback is triggered, updating the cardNumber variable.
// 5. The cardFlag variable is updated by calling CreditCardFlagDetector.getCardFlag(cardNumber), which detects the card type.
// 6. The detected card type is displayed below the input field in real-time.
```
