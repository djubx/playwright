            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app, and the `RealFlutter` widget is rendered.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` widget builds a `MaterialApp` with a `Scaffold` containing an `AppBar` and a `Column` of widgets.
// 3. The `Column` contains three `Row` widgets, each with two `Text` widgets separated by a `WxDivider`.
// 4. The user can see the different divider styles and colors used in each `Row`.
// 5. The app demonstrates the usage of the `wx_divider` package in a real-world scenario.
