# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Image Collage Widget

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `image_collage_widget` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  image_collage_widget: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Image Collage Widget

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the `ImageCollageWidget` in your app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:image_collage_widget/image_collage_widget.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Image Collage Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Image Collage Widget'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ImageCollageWidget(
            images: [
              'assets/image1.jpg',
              'assets/image2.jpg',
              'assets/image3.jpg',
              'assets/image4.jpg',
            ],
            collageType: CollageType.grid,
            crossAxisCount: 2, // Number of columns in the grid
            padding: EdgeInsets.all(8.0), // Padding around the images
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays a collage of images in a grid layout. The `ImageCollageWidget` takes a list of image paths and arranges them according to the specified collage type.

# Complete Example of Image Collage Widget

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:image_collage_widget/image_collage_widget.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Image Collage Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Image Collage Widget'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          // Centering the collage widget in the body
          child: ImageCollageWidget(
            images: [
              'assets/image1.jpg', // First image
              'assets/image2.jpg', // Second image
              'assets/image3.jpg', // Third image
              'assets/image4.jpg', // Fourth image
            ],
            collageType: CollageType.grid, // Setting the collage type to grid
            crossAxisCount: 2, // Number of columns in the grid
            padding: EdgeInsets.all(8.0), // Padding around the images
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the app
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which calls runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Image Collage Widget".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers the ImageCollageWidget.
// 5. The ImageCollageWidget takes a list of image paths and displays them in a grid layout.
// 6. The collage is configured to have 2 columns and padding around the images, creating a visually appealing collage.
