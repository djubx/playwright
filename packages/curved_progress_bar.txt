# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Curved Progress Bar

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **curved_progress_bar** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  curved_progress_bar: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Curved Progress Bar

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the curved progress bar in your app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:curved_progress_bar/curved_progress_bar.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  double progress = 0.0; // Initialize progress

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Simulate progress over time
    Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1), () {
      setState(() {
        progress = 0.3; // Update progress to 30%
      });
    });
    Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2), () {
      setState(() {
        progress = 0.7; // Update progress to 70%
      });
    });
    Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3), () {
      setState(() {
        progress = 1.0; // Complete progress
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Curved Progress Bar Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: CurvedProgressBar(
          progress: progress, // Set the current progress
          backgroundColor: Colors.grey[300], // Background color
          progressColor: Colors.blue, // Progress color
          strokeWidth: 10.0, // Width of the progress bar
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that uses the **curved_progress_bar** package to display a progress bar. The progress is updated over time to simulate loading.

# Complete Example of Curved Progress Bar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:curved_progress_bar/curved_progress_bar.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  double progress = 0.0; // Initialize progress

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Simulate progress over time
    Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1), () {
      setState(() {
        progress = 0.3; // Update progress to 30%
      });
    });
    Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2), () {
      setState(() {
        progress = 0.7; // Update progress to 70%
      });
    });
    Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3), () {
      setState(() {
        progress = 1.0; // Complete progress
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Curved Progress Bar Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: CurvedProgressBar(
          progress: progress, // Set the current progress
          backgroundColor: Colors.grey[300], // Background color
          progressColor: Colors.blue, // Progress color
          strokeWidth: 10.0, // Width of the progress bar
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 2. In the initState method, we simulate progress updates using Future.delayed.
// 3. After 1 second, the progress is set to 30%.
// 4. After 2 seconds, the progress is updated to 70%.
// 5. After 3 seconds, the progress reaches 100%.
// 6. The CurvedProgressBar widget is built in the center of the screen, displaying the current progress.
// 7. The progress bar's appearance can be customized using backgroundColor, progressColor, and strokeWidth.
```
