# Setting Up and Using the Bruno Package

## Installation
To get started with the Bruno package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  bruno: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package. After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter and the Bruno package. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
Once you have installed the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use a button from the Bruno package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bruno/bruno.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Bruno Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: BrunoButton(
            text: 'Click Me',
            onPressed: () {
              // Action to perform on button press
              print('Button Pressed!');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to create a simple app with a button using the Bruno package. The button is styled according to Material Design principles and is fully functional.

# Complete Example of a Flutter Application Using Bruno

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bruno/bruno.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Bruno Package Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Bruno UI Components'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Using a Bruno button
            BrunoButton(
              text: 'Click Me',
              onPressed: () {
                // Action to perform on button press
                print('Button Pressed!');
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between widgets
            // Using a Bruno card
            BrunoCard(
              title: 'Bruno Card',
              content: Text('This is a card from the Bruno package.'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. MyHomePage is defined as the home screen, which contains an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the Bruno button and card vertically.
// 5. The Bruno button is created with an onPressed callback that prints a message to the console when clicked.
// 6. A Bruno card is displayed below the button, showcasing another UI component from the Bruno package.
// 7. The app is responsive and follows Material Design guidelines, providing a consistent user experience.
