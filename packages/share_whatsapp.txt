## Setup Process

To get started with the `share_whatsapp` package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the `share_whatsapp` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  share_whatsapp: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/share_whatsapp).

### Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

#### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to share images.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to save images to your photo library.</string>
```

### Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:share_whatsapp/share_whatsapp.dart';
```

## Using the Package

To share content using the `share_whatsapp` package, you can use the following method:

```dart
ShareWhatsApp.share(
  text: "Check out this amazing content!",
  phone: "+1234567890", // Optional: phone number to share directly
);
```

This method allows you to share text directly to WhatsApp. You can also share images and files by providing the appropriate parameters.

### Example Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the package in a Flutter app:

```dart
void shareContent() {
  ShareWhatsApp.share(
    text: "Hello from my Flutter app!",
    phone: "+1234567890", // Optional
  );
}
```

This function can be called on a button press or any other event in your app.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:share_whatsapp/share_whatsapp.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Share WhatsApp Example',
      home: SharePage(),
    );
  }
}

class SharePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Share to WhatsApp'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Call the shareContent function when the button is pressed
            shareContent();
          },
          child: Text('Share Message'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void shareContent() {
    // This function shares a message to WhatsApp
    ShareWhatsApp.share(
      text: "Hello from my Flutter app!",
      phone: "+1234567890", // Optional: phone number to share directly
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home page (SharePage).
// 3. SharePage contains a button that, when pressed, triggers the shareContent function.
// 4. The shareContent function uses the ShareWhatsApp package to share a message to WhatsApp.
// 5. The user can optionally specify a phone number to share the message directly to a specific contact.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, the application starts with a simple interface that contains a button. When the button is pressed, it triggers the `shareContent` function, which uses the `share_whatsapp` package to share a predefined message to WhatsApp. The optional phone number parameter allows for direct sharing to a specific contact if desired.

This structured approach to using the `share_whatsapp` package provides a clear understanding of its capabilities, setup, and practical application within a Flutter project.
