# SwipeButtonFlutter Package Overview

The `swipebuttonflutter` package is a Flutter widget that allows developers to create swipeable buttons, enhancing user interaction in mobile applications. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where a user needs to confirm an action, such as deleting an item, accepting terms, or completing a purchase. The swipe gesture provides a more intuitive and engaging way for users to interact with buttons compared to traditional tap buttons.

## Features
- **Customizable Appearance**: The swipe button can be styled to match the app's theme, including colors, shapes, and sizes.
- **Gesture Detection**: It detects swipe gestures, allowing for smooth and responsive interactions.
- **Callback Functions**: Developers can define actions that occur upon successful swipes, such as navigating to a new screen or executing a function.
- **Platform Compatibility**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

## When to Use
- **Confirmation Actions**: When you want users to confirm an action before proceeding.
- **Interactive Tutorials**: To guide users through app features with engaging interactions.
- **Game Interfaces**: For swipe-based controls in mobile games.

The `swipebuttonflutter` package is a great addition to any Flutter application that aims to improve user experience through interactive design.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using SwipeButtonFlutter

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the `swipebuttonflutter` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  swipebuttonflutter: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:swipebuttonflutter/swipebuttonflutter.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the SwipeButton
You can now use the `SwipeButton` widget in your application. Below is a simple example of how to implement it:

### Android Configuration
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration
For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file if your app requires them. However, the `swipebuttonflutter` package does not require any specific permissions.

## Step 5: Customizing the SwipeButton
You can customize the appearance and behavior of the `SwipeButton` by modifying its properties. Hereâ€™s an example:

```dart
SwipeButton(
  onSwipe: () {
    // Action to perform on swipe
    print("Button Swiped!");
  },
  buttonText: "Swipe to Confirm",
  buttonColor: Colors.blue,
  backgroundColor: Colors.grey,
);
```

This code creates a swipe button that prints a message when swiped.

# Complete Example of SwipeButtonFlutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:swipebuttonflutter/swipebuttonflutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Swipe Button Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Swipe Button Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: SwipeButton(
            onSwipe: () {
              // Action to perform on swipe
              // This could be a navigation or a confirmation action
              print("Button Swiped!");
            },
            buttonText: "Swipe to Confirm",
            buttonColor: Colors.blue,
            backgroundColor: Colors.grey,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Swipe Button Example".
// 4. In the body of the Scaffold, a SwipeButton widget is placed at the center.
// 5. The SwipeButton has an onSwipe callback that prints "Button Swiped!" when the button is swiped.
// 6. The button displays the text "Swipe to Confirm" with a blue color on a grey background.
// 7. When the user swipes the button, the action defined in onSwipe is executed, providing feedback to the user.
