# Setting Up and Using Flutter Kronos
=====================================

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

Add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  flutter_kronos: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_kronos/flutter_kronos.dart';
```

### Step 3: Use the Package

Use the `Kronos` class to manipulate dates and times:

```dart
void main() {
  // Create a new Kronos instance
  Kronos kronos = Kronos();

  // Get the current date and time
  DateTime now = kronos.now();

  // Print the current date and time
  print(now);
}
```

### Platform-Specific Details

The `flutter_kronos` package works on both Android and iOS platforms. However, there are some platform-specific details to keep in mind:

*   On Android, the package uses the `java.util.Calendar` class to manage dates and times.
*   On iOS, the package uses the `NSDate` class to manage dates and times.

### Configurations and Optimizations

The `flutter_kronos` package provides several configurations and optimizations to improve performance and accuracy:

*   You can set the time zone using the `kronos.timeZone` property.
*   You can customize the date and time format using the `kronos.dateFormat` property.

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_kronos/flutter_kronos.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Kronos Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  Kronos _kronos = Kronos();

  void _printCurrentDateTime() {
    // Get the current date and time
    DateTime now = _kronos.now();

    // Print the current date and time
    print(now);
  }

  void _printCustomDateTime() {
    // Set the custom date and time format
    _kronos.dateFormat = 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss';

    // Get the current date and time
    DateTime now = _kronos.now();

    // Print the current date and time in custom format
    print(_kronos.format(now));
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Kronos Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _printCurrentDateTime,
              child: Text('Print Current Date and Time'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _printCustomDateTime,
              child: Text('Print Custom Date and Time'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a home page containing two buttons.
// 2. The user clicks the 'Print Current Date and Time' button, which calls the _printCurrentDateTime function.
// 3. The _printCurrentDateTime function gets the current date and time using the Kronos class and prints it to the console.
// 4. The user clicks the 'Print Custom Date and Time' button, which calls the _printCustomDateTime function.
// 5. The _printCustomDateTime function sets a custom date and time format using the Kronos class, gets the current date and time, and prints it to the console in the custom format.

// In summary, this code demonstrates how to use the flutter_kronos package to manage dates and times in a Flutter app, including getting the current date and time, setting custom date and time formats, and printing dates and times to the console.
