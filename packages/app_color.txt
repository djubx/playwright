# Overview of the app_color Flutter Package

The `app_color` package is a powerful tool for managing and utilizing color schemes in Flutter applications. It simplifies the process of defining, accessing, and applying colors throughout your app, ensuring consistency and ease of maintenance. This package is particularly useful for developers who want to create visually appealing applications with a cohesive color palette.

## When to Use `app_color`

- **Consistent Color Management**: When you need to maintain a consistent color scheme across your app.
- **Dynamic Theming**: If your app requires dynamic theming based on user preferences or system settings.
- **Ease of Maintenance**: When you want to centralize color definitions for easier updates and modifications.

## Key Features

- **Centralized Color Definitions**: Define all your colors in one place for easy access and modification.
- **Support for Light and Dark Themes**: Easily switch between light and dark themes.
- **Custom Color Schemes**: Create and manage custom color schemes tailored to your app's branding.

# Setting Up and Using the app_color Package

## Installation

To get started with the `app_color` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  app_color: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the correct configurations. Typically, no additional configurations are needed for the `app_color` package, but make sure your `minSdkVersion` is set appropriately.

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file is configured correctly. Again, no specific configurations are required for the `app_color` package, but it's good practice to ensure your project settings are up to date.

## Using the Package

To use the `app_color` package, you need to import it into your Dart files:

```dart
import 'package:app_color/app_color.dart';
```

You can then define your color scheme and use it throughout your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set up a color scheme:

```dart
final AppColor myColors = AppColor(
  primary: Color(0xFF6200EE),
  secondary: Color(0xFF03DAC6),
  background: Color(0xFFFFFFFF),
  surface: Color(0xFFEEEEEE),
  error: Color(0xFFB00020),
);
```

You can access these colors anywhere in your app using `myColors.primary`, `myColors.secondary`, etc.

# Complete Example of Using app_color

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:app_color/app_color.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  // Define a color scheme using the app_color package
  final AppColor myColors = AppColor(
    primary: Color(0xFF6200EE), // Primary color
    secondary: Color(0xFF03DAC6), // Secondary color
    background: Color(0xFFFFFFFF), // Background color
    surface: Color(0xFFEEEEEE), // Surface color
    error: Color(0xFFB00020), // Error color
  );

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'App Color Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primaryColor: myColors.primary, // Use primary color
        accentColor: myColors.secondary, // Use secondary color
        scaffoldBackgroundColor: myColors.background, // Set background color
      ),
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('app_color Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text(
                'Hello, Flutter!',
                style: TextStyle(color: myColors.primary, fontSize: 24), // Use primary color for text
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Action when button is pressed
                },
                child: Text('Press Me'),
                style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
                  primary: myColors.secondary, // Use secondary color for button
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget defines a color scheme using the AppColor class.
// 3. The MaterialApp widget is created with a title and a theme that utilizes the defined colors.
// 4. The Scaffold widget provides a structure for the app, including an AppBar and a body.
// 5. The body contains a Center widget that centers its children, which are a Text widget and an ElevatedButton.
// 6. The Text widget displays a greeting message using the primary color.
// 7. The ElevatedButton is styled with the secondary color and has an onPressed action defined.
// 8. This structure allows for easy color management and a consistent look throughout the app.
