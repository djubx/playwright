# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_face_pile

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `flutter_face_pile` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_face_pile: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_face_pile).

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_face_pile/flutter_face_pile.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Face Pile Widget

You can now use the `FacePile` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
FacePile(
  avatars: [
    'https://example.com/avatar1.png',
    'https://example.com/avatar2.png',
    'https://example.com/avatar3.png',
  ],
  maxAvatars: 5,
  onTap: (index) {
    // Handle avatar tap
    print('Avatar $index tapped');
  },
)
```

This code snippet creates a face pile with three avatars and handles tap events on each avatar.

# Complete Example of flutter_face_pile

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_face_pile/flutter_face_pile.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Face Pile Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Face Pile Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: FacePile(
            // List of avatar URLs
            avatars: [
              'https://example.com/avatar1.png',
              'https://example.com/avatar2.png',
              'https://example.com/avatar3.png',
              'https://example.com/avatar4.png',
              'https://example.com/avatar5.png',
            ],
            maxAvatars: 5, // Maximum number of avatars to display
            onTap: (index) {
              // Handle tap on avatar
              print('Avatar $index tapped');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Face Pile Example'.
// 4. In the body of the Scaffold, a FacePile widget is centered.
// 5. The FacePile widget takes a list of avatar URLs and a maximum number of avatars to display.
// 6. When an avatar is tapped, the onTap callback is triggered, printing the index of the tapped avatar to the console.
```
