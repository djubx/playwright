# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Dash Bubble

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the **dash_bubble** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dash_bubble: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

For iOS, ensure that your `ios/Podfile` has the platform set to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:dash_bubble/dash_bubble.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using Dash Bubble
You can now use the `DashBubble` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a bubble:

```dart
DashBubble(
  child: Text('Hello, World!'),
  color: Colors.blue,
  borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(15),
);
```

This will create a blue bubble with rounded corners containing the text "Hello, World!".

## Conclusion

                    offset: Offset(0, 5),
                  ),
                ],
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between bubbles
              // Another DashBubble with a different message
              DashBubble(
                child: Text(
                  'Another bubble here!',
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
                ),
                color: Colors.green,
                borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(15),
                shadow: [
                  BoxShadow(
                    color: Colors.black26,
                    blurRadius: 10,
                    offset: Offset(0, 5),
                  ),
                ],
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Dash Bubble Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Column widget.
// 5. Inside the Column, two DashBubble widgets are created, each containing a Text widget.
// 6. The first DashBubble is blue, and the second is green, both with rounded corners and shadows.
// 7. The bubbles are spaced apart using a SizedBox widget.
// 8. The app displays two bubbles with messages, showcasing the use of the dash_bubble package.
