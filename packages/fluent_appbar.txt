# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Fluent AppBar Package
===========================================================

## Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project
-----------------------------------------

To use the `fluent_appbar` package, you need to add it to your project's `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under the `dependencies` section:

```yml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  fluent_appbar: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` in your terminal to install the package.

## Step 2: Import the Package
---------------------------

In your Dart file, import the package using the following line:

```dart
import 'package:fluent_appbar/fluent_appbar.dart';
```

## Step 3: Use the FluentAppBar Widget
--------------------------------------

To use the `FluentAppBar` widget, simply create an instance of it and pass it to the `appBar` property of your `Scaffold` widget. Here's an example:

```dart
Scaffold(
  appBar: FluentAppBar(
    title: Text('Fluent AppBar Example'),
  ),
  body: Center(
    child: Text('Hello, World!'),
  ),
)
```

## Platform-Specific Details
---------------------------

The `fluent_appbar` package works on both Android and iOS platforms. However, you may need to adjust the AppBar's style and layout to match the platform's design guidelines.

### Android

On Android, you can use the `FluentAppBar` widget as is. However, you may want to adjust the AppBar's elevation and shadow to match the platform's design guidelines.

### iOS

On iOS, you need to wrap the `FluentAppBar` widget with a `PreferredSizeWidget` to set the AppBar's height. You can use the `PreferredSize` widget to set the height.

```dart
Scaffold(
  appBar: PreferredSize(
    preferredSize: Size.fromHeight(44),
    child: FluentAppBar(
      title: Text('Fluent AppBar Example'),
    ),
  ),
  body: Center(
    child: Text('Hello, World!'),
  ),
)
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fluent_appbar/fluent_appbar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Fluent AppBar Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      // Create a FluentAppBar widget with a custom title and actions
      appBar: FluentAppBar(
        title: Text('Fluent AppBar Example'),
        actions: [
          // Add a custom action button
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.search),
            onPressed: () {
              print('Search button pressed');
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Hello, World!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and the MyApp widget is created.
// 2. The MyApp widget builds the MaterialApp widget with the title and theme.
// 3. The MaterialApp widget builds the MyHomePage widget.
// 4. The MyHomePage widget builds the Scaffold widget with the FluentAppBar widget.
// 5. The FluentAppBar widget is created with a custom title and actions.
// 6. The user can interact with the FluentAppBar widget by pressing the action buttons.
// 7. The action buttons trigger the onPressed callbacks, which print a message to the console.

// In summary, the code creates a basic Flutter app with a custom AppBar using the FluentAppBar package.
// The AppBar has a custom title and actions, and the user can interact with it by pressing the action buttons.
