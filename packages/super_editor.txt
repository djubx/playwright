# Setting up the Super Editor Package

To use the Super Editor package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Here's how:

1. Add the Super Editor package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  super_editor: ^1.0.0
```
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Platform-Specific Configurations

#### Android

To use the Super Editor package on Android, you need to add the following configuration to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:
```xml
<application
  ...
  android:hardwareAccelerated="true"
  ...
>
```
This enables hardware acceleration for the Super Editor package.

#### iOS

To use the Super Editor package on iOS, you need to add the following configuration to your `Info.plist` file:
```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
  <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
  <true/>
</dict>
```
This enables arbitrary loads for the Super Editor package.

### Using the Super Editor Package

To use the Super Editor package, you need to create a `SuperEditor` widget and pass it a `TextEditingController` instance. Here's an example:
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:super_editor/super_editor.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  final _textController = TextEditingController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: SuperEditor(
        controller: _textController,
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
This creates a basic text editor with the Super Editor package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:super_editor/super_editor.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  final _textController = TextEditingController();

  // Step 1: Create a SuperEditor widget
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      // Step 2: Pass the TextEditingController instance to the SuperEditor widget
      body: SuperEditor(
        controller: _textController,
        // Step 3: Customize the text editor with options
        options: SuperEditorOptions(
          // Step 4: Enable rich text editing
          richText: true,
          // Step 5: Enable text alignment options
          textAlign: true,
          // Step 6: Enable font size and color customization
          fontSize: true,
          fontColor: true,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application flow:
// 1. The user interacts with the text editor.
// 2. The SuperEditor widget updates the text based on the user's input.
// 3. The user can customize the text with options (e.g., bold, italic, underline).

// 5. The user can change the font size and color.
// 6. The SuperEditor widget updates the text based on the user's customizations.

// Final summary:
// The Super Editor package provides a powerful text editing experience for Flutter apps.
// It offers a range of features, including rich text editing, text alignment options, and font size and color customization.
