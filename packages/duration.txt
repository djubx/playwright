# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Duration Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **duration** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  duration: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the package to start using it:

```dart
import 'package:duration/duration.dart';
```

## Step 5: Basic Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the **duration** package:

```dart
void main() {
  // Create a duration of 1 hour and 30 minutes
  Duration duration = Duration(hours: 1, minutes: 30);
  
  // Convert duration to a human-readable string
  String formatted = prettyDuration(duration);
  print(formatted); // Output: "1 hour, 30 minutes"
}
```

This example demonstrates how to create a duration and convert it into a readable format. You can perform various operations like addition and subtraction on durations as well.

# Complete Example of Using the Duration Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:duration/duration.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Duration Package Example',
      home: DurationHome(),
    );
  }
}

class DurationHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DurationHomeState createState() => _DurationHomeState();
}

class _DurationHomeState extends State<DurationHome> {
  Duration _duration = Duration(hours: 0, minutes: 0);
  String _formattedDuration = '';

  // Function to add 15 minutes to the current duration
  void _addDuration() {
    setState(() {
      _duration += Duration(minutes: 15);
      _formattedDuration = prettyDuration(_duration); // Format the duration
    });
  }

  // Function to reset the duration to zero
  void _resetDuration() {
    setState(() {
      _duration = Duration(hours: 0, minutes: 0);
      _formattedDuration = prettyDuration(_duration); // Format the duration
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Duration Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Current Duration:',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            Text(
              _formattedDuration.isEmpty ? '0 hours, 0 minutes' : _formattedDuration,
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _addDuration,
              child: Text('Add 15 Minutes'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _resetDuration,
              child: Text('Reset Duration'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget DurationHome.
// 3. DurationHome is a stateful widget that maintains the current duration and its formatted string.
// 4. The _addDuration function adds 15 minutes to the current duration and updates the formatted string.
// 5. The _resetDuration function resets the duration to zero and updates the formatted string.
// 6. The UI displays the current duration and provides buttons to add time or reset the duration.
```
