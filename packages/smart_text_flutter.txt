# Setting Up and Using smart_text_flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `smart_text_flutter` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

### Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `smart_text_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  smart_text_flutter: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

### Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### For Android

Ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

#### For iOS

In your `ios/Podfile`, ensure that the platform is set to at least iOS 10:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

### Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:smart_text_flutter/smart_text_flutter.dart';
```

### Step 5: Using the Package

You can now use the `SmartText` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
SmartText(
  'This is a long text that will be wrapped and truncated if it exceeds the container width.',
  maxLines: 2,
  overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis,
  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16, color: Colors.black),
)
```

This widget will display the text, wrapping it to a maximum of two lines and truncating it with an ellipsis if it exceeds that limit.

### Conclusion

You have now set up the `smart_text_flutter` package in your Flutter application. You can customize the `SmartText` widget further to suit your design needs.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
# Complete Example of smart_text_flutter

Below is a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the `smart_text_flutter` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:smart_text_flutter/smart_text_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Smart Text Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Smart Text Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
            child: SmartText(
              'This is a long text that will be wrapped and truncated if it exceeds the container width. '
              'The smart_text_flutter package allows for dynamic text handling in Flutter applications.',
              maxLines: 2, // Set the maximum number of lines
              overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis, // Set the overflow behavior
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16, color: Colors.black), // Customize text style
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with MyApp().
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, we use the SmartText widget to display a long text.
// 5. The SmartText widget automatically handles text wrapping and truncation based on the provided properties.
// 6. The text is styled with a font size of 16 and a black color, ensuring it is readable.
// 7. The application is responsive and will adjust the text display based on the device's screen size.
```
