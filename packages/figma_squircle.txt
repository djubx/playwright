# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Figma Squircle Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the **figma_squircle** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  figma_squircle: ^1.0.0
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:figma_squircle/figma_squircle.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Squircle Widget
You can now use the `FigmaSquircle` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a squircle-shaped container:

```dart
FigmaSquircle(
  radius: 20.0, // Adjust the radius for the squircle effect
  child: Container(
    color: Colors.blue,
    height: 100,
    width: 100,
    child: Center(child: Text('Squircle')),
  ),
);
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, make sure your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Optimizations
To ensure optimal performance, consider using the `FigmaSquircle` widget within a `ListView` or `GridView` for dynamic content. This will help in managing memory and rendering efficiently.

With these steps, you are now ready to implement the **figma_squircle** package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Using the Figma Squircle Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:figma_squircle/figma_squircle.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Figma Squircle Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Figma Squircle Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Creating a squircle-shaped container
              FigmaSquircle(
                radius: 30.0, // Setting the radius for the squircle
                child: Container(
                  color: Colors.red,
                  height: 150,
                  width: 150,
                  child: Center(
                    child: Text(
                      'Squircle 1',
                      style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
                    ),
                  ),
                ),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between the squircles
              // Another squircle-shaped container
              FigmaSquircle(
                radius: 50.0, // Different radius for variation
                child: Container(
                  color: Colors.green,
                  height: 150,
                  width: 150,
                  child: Center(
                    child: Text(
                      'Squircle 2',
                      style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
                    ),
                  ),
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Figma Squircle Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Column widget.
// 5. Inside the Column, two FigmaSquircle widgets are created with different radius values.
// 6. Each FigmaSquircle contains a Container with a colored background and centered text.
// 7. A SizedBox is used to add space between the two squircle containers for better visual separation.
