# Setting Up and Using the `canvas_danmaku` Package

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `canvas_danmaku` package and provide platform-specific details for both Android and iOS.

## Installation

To add the `canvas_danmaku` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  canvas_danmaku: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/canvas_danmaku).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Podfile`.
2. Uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage

To use the `canvas_danmaku` package, you need to create a `DanmakuController` and a `DanmakuView` widget. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:canvas_danmaku/canvas_danmaku.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Danmaku Example')),
        body: DanmakuView(
          controller: DanmakuController(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application with a `DanmakuView` that will display animated text.

# Complete Example of `canvas_danmaku`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:canvas_danmaku/canvas_danmaku.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late DanmakuController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the DanmakuController
    _controller = DanmakuController();
    // Add some sample danmaku messages
    _controller.addDanmaku(Danmaku(
      text: 'Hello, World!',
      color: Colors.red,
      speed: 100,
    ));
    _controller.addDanmaku(Danmaku(
      text: 'Welcome to the stream!',
      color: Colors.blue,
      speed: 150,
    ));
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the controller when the widget is removed from the widget tree
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Danmaku Example')),
        body: DanmakuView(
          controller: _controller,
          // Set the height of the DanmakuView
          height: 200,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The RealFlutter widget is created, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 2. In the initState method, we initialize the DanmakuController.
// 3. We add two danmaku messages with different texts, colors, and speeds.
// 4. The DanmakuView widget is built in the build method, displaying the messages.
// 5. When the widget is disposed, we ensure to dispose of the controller to free up resources.
