# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Custom Floating Action Button

## Installation
To use the `custom_floating_action_button` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  custom_floating_action_button: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/custom_floating_action_button).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package
Once you have installed the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a custom floating action button.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:custom_floating_action_button/custom_floating_action_button.dart';
```

2. Create a basic Flutter app and use the `CustomFloatingActionButton` widget.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:custom_floating_action_button/custom_floating_action_button.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Custom FAB Example')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Press the FAB!')),
      floatingActionButton: CustomFloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          // Action when FAB is pressed
        },
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application with a custom floating action button. You can customize the button further by exploring the package's documentation for additional properties and methods.

# Complete Example of Custom Floating Action Button

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:custom_floating_action_button/custom_floating_action_button.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to track the state of the FAB
  bool isOpen = false;

  // Function to toggle the FAB state
  void toggleFAB() {
    setState(() {
      isOpen = !isOpen; // Toggle the state
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Custom FAB Example')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Press the FAB!')),
      floatingActionButton: CustomFloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: toggleFAB, // Call toggleFAB when pressed
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
        // Customize the FAB appearance
        backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
        foregroundColor: Colors.white,
      ),
      // Add additional buttons that appear when the FAB is open
      floatingActionButtonLocation: FloatingActionButtonLocation.endFloat,
      secondaryButtons: isOpen
          ? [
              CustomFloatingActionButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Action for first secondary button
                },
                child: Icon(Icons.edit),
                backgroundColor: Colors.green,
              ),
              CustomFloatingActionButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Action for second secondary button
                },
                child: Icon(Icons.delete),
                backgroundColor: Colors.red,
              ),
            ]
          : [],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is the main screen, which contains the FAB.
// 3. The FAB toggles its state when pressed, showing or hiding secondary buttons.
// 4. Secondary buttons can perform different actions based on user interaction.
```
<!-- END_MAIN -->
```

### Summary of Application Flow
- The application initializes with a main screen containing a custom floating action button (FAB).
- When the FAB is pressed, it toggles the visibility of secondary buttons.
- Each secondary button can be configured to perform different actions, enhancing the user experience with a dynamic interface.

This example demonstrates how to effectively use the `custom_floating_action_button` package to create a functional and visually appealing floating action button in a Flutter application.
