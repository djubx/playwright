# Setting Up and Using _flutterfire_internals

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `_flutterfire_internals` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Installation

To get started, you need to add the `_flutterfire_internals` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  _flutterfire_internals: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open the `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure that you have the following configurations:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add the Google Services JSON file to your project. Download it from the Firebase console and place it in the `android/app` directory.

### iOS
1. Open the `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following configurations:
   ```xml
   <key>FirebaseAppDelegateProxyEnabled</key>
   <false/>
   ```

2. Ensure you have the necessary permissions set for network access and other Firebase services.

## Using the Package

Once you have completed the installation and configuration, you can start using the `_flutterfire_internals` package in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initialize Firebase and use it to authenticate a user.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import '_flutterfire_internals/_flutterfire_internals.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'FlutterFire Internals Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Firebase Auth Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initialize Firebase
              await Firebase.initializeApp();
              // Sign in a user
              UserCredential userCredential = await FirebaseAuth.instance.signInWithEmailAndPassword(
                email: 'test@example.com',
                password: 'password123',
              );
              print('User signed in: ${userCredential.user?.email}');
            },
            child: Text('Sign In'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize Firebase and provide a button for users to sign in. When the button is pressed, the app attempts to sign in with the provided email and password.

# Complete Example of Using _flutterfire_internals

Here is a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the `_flutterfire_internals` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import '_flutterfire_internals/_flutterfire_internals.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'FlutterFire Internals Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Firebase Auth Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initialize Firebase
              await Firebase.initializeApp();
              // Sign in a user
              UserCredential userCredential = await FirebaseAuth.instance.signInWithEmailAndPassword(
                email: 'test@example.com',
                password: 'password123',
              );
              // Print the signed-in user's email
              print('User signed in: ${userCredential.user?.email}');
            },
            child: Text('Sign In'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget with an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, Firebase is initialized.
// 5. The app attempts to sign in a user with the specified email and password.
// 6. If successful, the user's email is printed to the console.
```
