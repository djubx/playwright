# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Built-in Keyboard Package

## Installation
To add the `built_in_keyboard` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  built_in_keyboard: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
- Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` has the necessary permissions if your keyboard requires them.
- Test the keyboard on various Android devices to ensure compatibility.

### iOS
- For iOS, ensure that your app's Info.plist is configured correctly if you are using any custom fonts or resources for the keyboard.

## Basic Usage
To use the `built_in_keyboard`, you need to create an instance of the keyboard in your widget tree. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:built_in_keyboard/built_in_keyboard.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Built-in Keyboard Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: BuiltInKeyboard(
            onKeyPressed: (key) {
              // Handle key press
              print('Key pressed: $key');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple app that displays the built-in keyboard and prints the key pressed to the console.

### Additional Configurations
You can customize the keyboard layout and appearance by passing additional parameters to the `BuiltInKeyboard` widget. Refer to the package documentation for more details on customization options.

# Complete Example of Built-in Keyboard

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:built_in_keyboard/built_in_keyboard.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Built-in Keyboard Example')),
        body: KeyboardExample(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class KeyboardExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _KeyboardExampleState createState() => _KeyboardExampleState();
}

class _KeyboardExampleState extends State<KeyboardExample> {
  String inputText = ''; // Variable to hold the input text

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Text(
          inputText, // Display the current input text
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20),
        BuiltInKeyboard(
          onKeyPressed: (key) {
            // Handle key press
            setState(() {
              inputText += key; // Append the pressed key to the input text
            });
          },
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which sets up the MaterialApp and Scaffold.
// 2. Inside the Scaffold, we have a KeyboardExample widget that manages the state of the input text.
// 3. The inputText variable holds the current text input from the keyboard.
// 4. When a key is pressed on the BuiltInKeyboard, the onKeyPressed callback is triggered.
// 5. The pressed key is appended to the inputText variable, and the UI is updated using setState.
// 6. The updated inputText is displayed in the Text widget above the keyboard.
