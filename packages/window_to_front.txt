# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Window to Front Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `window_to_front` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  window_to_front: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/window_to_front).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions. You may need to add the following permission to allow your app to draw over other apps:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW"/>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you need to ensure that your app has the appropriate settings in the `Info.plist` file. Add the following key to request permission for notifications:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>fetch</string>
    <string>remote-notification</string>
</array>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to bring a window to the front:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:window_to_front/window_to_front.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Window to Front Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Bring the current window to the front
              WindowToFront.bringToFront();
            },
            child: Text('Bring Window to Front'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, the current window will be brought to the front.

# Complete Example of Using the Window to Front Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:window_to_front/window_to_front.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Window to Front Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Bring the current window to the front
              WindowToFront.bringToFront();
            },
            child: Text('Bring Window to Front'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the onPressed callback is triggered.
// 5. The WindowToFront.bringToFront() method is called, which brings the current window to the front.
// 6. This allows the user to focus on the application window, enhancing user experience in scenarios where attention is needed.
```

In summary, the `window_to_front` package provides a straightforward way to manage window focus in Flutter applications. By following the setup and usage instructions, developers can easily integrate this functionality into their apps, ensuring that important windows are always visible when needed.
