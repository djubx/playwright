# Setting Up and Using flutter_tawkto

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_tawkto` package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_tawkto` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_tawkto: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open the `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open the `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions to allow network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Initialize Tawk.to in Your App

In your main Dart file, you need to initialize the Tawk.to service. Here’s how to do it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_tawkto/flutter_tawkto.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Tawk.to Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize Tawk.to with your Tawk.to property ID
    TawkTo.init('YOUR_TAWKTO_PROPERTY_ID');
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Tawk.to Chat Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to the Tawk.to chat!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Replace `YOUR_TAWKTO_PROPERTY_ID` with your actual Tawk.to property ID.

## Step 4: Running the App

Now that you have set up everything, run your Flutter application on an emulator or a physical device. You should see the Tawk.to chat widget appear, allowing users to interact with support agents.

# Complete Example of flutter_tawkto

Here’s a complete example of a Flutter application using the `flutter_tawkto` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_tawkto/flutter_tawkto.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// Main application widget
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Tawk.to Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

// Main screen widget
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize Tawk.to with your Tawk.to property ID
    TawkTo.init('YOUR_TAWKTO_PROPERTY_ID');
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Tawk.to Chat Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to the Tawk.to chat!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that initializes Tawk.to in its initState method.
// 4. The Tawk.to service is initialized with a property ID, allowing users to chat with support.
// 5. The build method of RealFlutter returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a centered welcome message.
```
