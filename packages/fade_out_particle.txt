# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Fade Out Particle Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the `fade_out_particle` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  fade_out_particle: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions or configurations in your `Info.plist` file, depending on your app's requirements. However, for basic usage of the `fade_out_particle` package, no specific configurations are necessary.

## Step 3: Using the Package
To use the `fade_out_particle` package, you can create a simple widget that utilizes the particle effect. Below is a basic example of how to implement it in your Flutter application.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fade_out_particle/fade_out_particle.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Fade Out Particle Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: FadeOutParticle(
            particleCount: 100, // Number of particles
            duration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Duration of the fade out
            child: Icon(Icons.star, size: 100, color: Colors.yellow), // Child widget
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays a star icon with a fade-out particle effect.

# Complete Example of Fade Out Particle

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fade_out_particle/fade_out_particle.dart';

// Main class of the application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Fade Out Particle Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Center widget to position the particles
          child: FadeOutParticle(
            particleCount: 100, // Set the number of particles to be generated
            duration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Set the duration for the fade-out effect
            child: Icon(Icons.star, size: 100, color: Colors.yellow), // The child widget that will emit particles
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
3. Inside the Center widget, the FadeOutParticle widget is used to create the particle effect.
4. The FadeOutParticle widget takes in parameters like particleCount and duration to control the effect.
5. The child of the FadeOutParticle is an Icon widget, which will emit particles when displayed.
6. When the app runs, the star icon appears in the center of the screen, and particles will fade out from it over the specified duration.
