Here's a detailed technical blog on the "skeleton_loader" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Skeleton Loader Flutter Package

The **skeleton_loader** package is a Flutter library designed to create skeleton loading screens, which are placeholders that mimic the layout of the content that is being loaded. This enhances the user experience by providing a visual cue that content is on its way, rather than leaving users staring at a blank screen.

## When to Use

You should consider using the skeleton_loader package in scenarios where:
- You are fetching data from an API and want to provide a smooth loading experience.
- You want to improve the perceived performance of your app by showing a loading state that resembles the final content.
- You are building applications that require a polished and professional look during data loading.

## Features

- **Customizable Skeletons**: You can easily customize the shape, size, and color of the skeleton loaders to match your app's design.
- **Multiple Shapes**: The package supports various shapes like rectangles, circles, and lines, allowing for versatile loading indicators.
- **Easy Integration**: The package is straightforward to integrate into existing Flutter applications with minimal setup.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Skeleton Loader

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the skeleton_loader package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  skeleton_loader: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install Packages

Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Basic Usage

Hereâ€™s how to use the skeleton_loader in your Flutter application:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:skeleton_loader/skeleton_loader.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Skeleton Loader Example')),
      body: SkeletonLoader(
        builder: Container(
          height: 100,
          color: Colors.white,
        ),
        items: 5,
        period: Duration(seconds: 2),
        highlightColor: Colors.grey[300],
        direction: SkeletonDirection.ltr,
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple skeleton loader that displays five loading items. The loader will animate from left to right, giving users a visual indication that data is being loaded.

# Complete Example of Skeleton Loader

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:skeleton_loader/skeleton_loader.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Skeleton Loader Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Skeleton Loader Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: SkeletonLoader(
            // Container that will be used as a skeleton loader
            builder: Container(
              height: 100, // Height of the skeleton
              color: Colors.white, // Background color of the skeleton
            ),
            items: 5, // Number of skeleton items to display
            period: Duration(seconds: 2), // Duration of the loading animation
            highlightColor: Colors.grey[300], // Color of the highlight
            direction: SkeletonDirection.ltr, // Animation direction
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and a home widget.
// 3. The home widget is a Scaffold that contains an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, we use the SkeletonLoader to create a loading effect.
// 5. The SkeletonLoader takes a builder that defines the skeleton's appearance, the number of items, the animation period, highlight color, and direction.
// 6. When the app runs, users will see a loading animation that indicates data is being fetched, enhancing the user experience.
```
