# Overview of the `file_selector_ios` Flutter Package

The `file_selector_ios` package is a Flutter plugin that provides a way to select files from the iOS file system. This package is particularly useful for applications that require users to upload or select files, such as images, documents, or other media types. It leverages the native file selection capabilities of iOS, ensuring a seamless user experience.

## When to Use This Package
- **File Uploads**: When your app needs to allow users to upload files, such as images or documents.
- **Document Management**: For applications that manage documents, allowing users to select files from their device.
- **Media Selection**: When you need to let users select media files, such as videos or audio files.

## Key Features
- **Native File Selection**: Utilizes the native iOS file picker for a familiar user experience.
- **Multiple File Types**: Supports various file types, allowing you to specify which types of files can be selected.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Provides asynchronous methods for file selection, making it easy to integrate into your app's workflow.

# Setting Up and Using the `file_selector_ios` Package

## Installation
To use the `file_selector_ios` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  file_selector_ios: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/file_selector_ios).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### iOS Configuration
1. **Update Info.plist**: You need to add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file to request permission for file access:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to select images.</string>
<key>NSDocumentDirectoryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your documents to select files.</string>
```

2. **Enable Capabilities**: Ensure that your app has the necessary capabilities enabled in Xcode, such as "App Sandbox" if you're using file access.

### Android Configuration
While this package is primarily for iOS, if you plan to support Android, you can use the `file_selector` package, which provides similar functionality. Make sure to add the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`.

## Using the Package
To use the `file_selector_ios` package, you can follow these steps in your Flutter application:

1. Import the package:
```dart
import 'package:file_selector_ios/file_selector_ios.dart';
```

2. Create a method to select files:
```dart
Future<void> selectFile() async {
  // Call the file selector
  final result = await FileSelector.selectFile();
  if (result != null) {
    // Handle the selected file
    print('Selected file: ${result.path}');
  } else {
    print('No file selected.');
  }
}
```

3. Call this method from your UI, such as a button press.

# Complete Example of Using `file_selector_ios`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:file_selector_ios/file_selector_ios.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'File Selector Example',
      home: FileSelectorHome(),
    );
  }
}

class FileSelectorHome extends StatelessWidget {
  // Method to select a file
  Future<void> selectFile(BuildContext context) async {
    // Call the file selector
    final result = await FileSelector.selectFile();
    if (result != null) {
      // Show a dialog with the selected file path
      showDialog(
        context: context,
        builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
          title: Text('File Selected'),
          content: Text('Selected file: ${result.path}'),
          actions: [
            TextButton(
              onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
              child: Text('OK'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      );
    } else {
      // Show a dialog if no file was selected
      showDialog(
        context: context,
        builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
          title: Text('No File Selected'),
          content: Text('Please select a file.'),
          actions: [
            TextButton(
              onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
              child: Text('OK'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      );
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('File Selector Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () => selectFile(context), // Call the selectFile method
          child: Text('Select File'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget (FileSelectorHome).
// 3. FileSelectorHome contains a button that, when pressed, calls the selectFile method.
// 4. The selectFile method invokes the file selector and waits for the user to select a file.
// 5. If a file is selected, an AlertDialog displays the file path; if not, it shows a message indicating no file was selected.
// 6. The user can dismiss the dialog by pressing the OK button.
