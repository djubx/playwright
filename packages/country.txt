# Setting Up and Using the "country" Flutter Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up the "country" package in a Flutter project and demonstrate how to use its features effectively.

## Setup Process

1. **Add Dependency**: First, add the "country" package to your `pubspec.yaml` file.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     country: ^1.0.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run `flutter pub get` to install the new package.

3. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the package to start using it.

   ```dart
   import 'package:country/country.dart';
   ```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

- Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to support all features of the package.

  ```gradle
  defaultConfig {
      minSdkVersion 21
  }
  ```

### iOS

- No specific configurations are required for iOS, but ensure your deployment target is set to iOS 9.0 or higher in your `ios/Podfile`.

  ```ruby
  platform :ios, '9.0'
  ```

## Using the Package

- **Fetching Country Data**: Use the `Country` class to access country information.

  ```dart
  List<Country> countries = Country.ALL;
  ```

- **Displaying Country Flags**: The package provides a method to fetch and display country flags.

  ```dart
  Widget flag = Country.getFlag('US');
  ```

# Complete Example of Using the "country" Package

Below is a complete Flutter application demonstrating the key features of the "country" package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:country/country.dart';

void main() => runApp(RealFlutter());

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Country Package Demo',
      home: CountryListScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class CountryListScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Fetch all countries from the package
    List<Country> countries = Country.ALL;

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Country List'),
      ),
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: countries.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          // Get the current country
          Country country = countries[index];
          return ListTile(
            leading: Country.getFlag(country.isoCode), // Display the country flag
            title: Text(country.name), // Display the country name
            subtitle: Text(country.isoCode), // Display the country ISO code
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter class.
// RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// The home screen is defined by the CountryListScreen class, which is also a StatelessWidget.
// In CountryListScreen, we fetch all available countries using Country.ALL.
// A ListView.builder is used to create a scrollable list of countries.
// Each ListTile in the list displays the country's flag, name, and ISO code.
// The Country.getFlag method is used to fetch and display the flag for each country.
