Here's a detailed technical blog on the "lite_rolling_switch" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Description

The `lite_rolling_switch` Flutter package is a customizable switch widget that provides a visually appealing way to toggle between two states. It is particularly useful in applications where a simple on/off switch is needed, but with a more engaging user interface. This package allows developers to create switches that mimic the look and feel of a rolling switch, enhancing the user experience.

## When to Use This Package

- **Settings Toggle**: Ideal for toggling settings such as notifications, dark mode, or any binary option.
- **User Preferences**: Use it in forms where users can select preferences, making the selection process more interactive.
- **Game Controls**: Suitable for games where players can toggle features like sound or difficulty levels.

## Features

- **Customizable Appearance**: Change colors, sizes, and shapes to fit your app's theme.
- **Animation**: Smooth transitions between states enhance user engagement.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that integrates seamlessly with existing Flutter applications.

## Setup Process

To use the `lite_rolling_switch` package in your Flutter application, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     lite_rolling_switch: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
   ```

2. **Install the Package**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

     ```groovy
     android {
         ...
         defaultConfig {
             ...
             minSdkVersion 21
         }
     }
     ```

   - **iOS**: No additional configuration is required for iOS, but ensure your deployment target is set appropriately in `ios/Podfile`.

## Using the Package

To use the `lite_rolling_switch`, you can follow this simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:lite_rolling_switch/lite_rolling_switch.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  bool isActive = false; // Initial state of the switch

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Lite Rolling Switch Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: LiteRollingSwitch(
          value: isActive,
          onChanged: (bool state) {
            setState(() {
              isActive = state; // Update the state when the switch is toggled
            });
          },
          // Customize the switch appearance
          textOn: 'ON',
          textOff: 'OFF',
          colorOn: Colors.green,
          colorOff: Colors.red,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple app with a rolling switch that toggles between "ON" and "OFF" states. The `onChanged` callback updates the state of the switch, and the UI reflects this change.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:lite_rolling_switch/lite_rolling_switch.dart';

// Main entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// The main application widget
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Lite Rolling Switch Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(), // Set the home to our main widget
    );
  }
}

// The main widget that contains the rolling switch
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

// State class for RealFlutter
class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  bool isActive = false; // Initial state of the switch

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Lite Rolling Switch Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: LiteRollingSwitch(
          value: isActive, // Current state of the switch
          onChanged: (bool state) {
            setState(() {
              isActive = state; // Update the state when the switch is toggled
            });
          },
          // Customize the switch appearance
          textOn: 'ON', // Text displayed when switch is ON
          textOff: 'OFF', // Text displayed when switch is OFF
          colorOn: Colors.green, // Color when switch is ON
          colorOff: Colors.red, // Color when switch is OFF
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme, and specifies RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the switch (isActive).
// 4. The build method of _RealFlutterState creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a center widget.
// 5. The LiteRollingSwitch widget is created with the current state (isActive) and a callback to update the state.
// 6. When the switch is toggled, the onChanged callback is triggered, updating the isActive state and rebuilding the UI to reflect the new state.
```
