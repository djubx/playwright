# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using re_editor

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `re_editor` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  re_editor: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/re_editor).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the `re_editor` package:

```dart
import 'package:re_editor/re_editor.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the RealFlutter Class

You can now create a simple text editor using the `RealFlutter` class. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:re_editor/re_editor.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Rich Text Editor'),
        ),
        body: ReEditor(
          // Configuration options for the editor
          toolbarOptions: [
            ToolbarOption.bold,
            ToolbarOption.italic,
            ToolbarOption.underline,
          ],
          onChanged: (text) {
            // Handle text changes
            print('Text changed: $text');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with a rich text editor. The `ReEditor` widget is configured with a toolbar that includes bold, italic, and underline options.

# Complete Example of re_editor

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:re_editor/re_editor.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Rich Text Editor'),
        ),
        body: ReEditor(
          // Configuration options for the editor
          toolbarOptions: [
            ToolbarOption.bold, // Option to make text bold
            ToolbarOption.italic, // Option to make text italic
            ToolbarOption.underline, // Option to underline text
          ],
          onChanged: (text) {
            // Handle text changes
            print('Text changed: $text'); // Log the text changes
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Start the application
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the UI.
// 3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// 4. The AppBar displays the title 'Rich Text Editor'.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains the ReEditor widget.
// 6. The ReEditor widget is configured with a toolbar that includes options for bold, italic, and underline.
// 7. The onChanged callback is triggered whenever the text changes, logging the updated text to the console.
// 8. Finally, the runApp function initializes the app with the RealFlutter widget.
```
