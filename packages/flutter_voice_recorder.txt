# Setting Up and Using the Flutter Voice Recorder Package

## Installation
To get started with the `flutter_voice_recorder` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_voice_recorder: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_voice_recorder).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request permission for audio recording:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone to record audio.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save recordings.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `flutter_voice_recorder` package, you will need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_voice_recorder/flutter_voice_recorder.dart';
```

You can then create an instance of the `FlutterVoiceRecorder` class and use its methods to start and stop recording.

```dart
FlutterVoiceRecorder recorder = FlutterVoiceRecorder();
```

### Example Methods
- **Start Recording**: `await recorder.start()`
- **Stop Recording**: `await recorder.stop()`
- **Get Recording Status**: `await recorder.isRecording()`
- **Get File Path**: `recorder.path`

With these steps, you are now ready to implement voice recording in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Using Flutter Voice Recorder

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_voice_recorder/flutter_voice_recorder.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  FlutterVoiceRecorder recorder;
  bool isRecording = false;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the recorder
    recorder = FlutterVoiceRecorder();
  }

  // Method to start recording
  void startRecording() async {
    await recorder.start();
    setState(() {
      isRecording = true; // Update the recording state
    });
  }

  // Method to stop recording
  void stopRecording() async {
    await recorder.stop();
    setState(() {
      isRecording = false; // Update the recording state
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Voice Recorder Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Button to start/stop recording
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: isRecording ? stopRecording : startRecording,
                child: Text(isRecording ? 'Stop Recording' : 'Start Recording'),
              ),
              // Display recording status
              Text(isRecording ? 'Recording...' : 'Press to Record'),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget, we initialize the FlutterVoiceRecorder instance.
// 3. The UI consists of a button to start/stop recording and a text widget to show the recording status.
// 4. When the button is pressed, it calls either startRecording or stopRecording based on the current state.
// 5. The startRecording method starts the recording and updates the UI to reflect that recording is in progress.
// 6. The stopRecording method stops the recording and updates the UI to indicate that recording has stopped.
