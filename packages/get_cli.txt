# Overview of the get_cli Flutter Package
=============================================

The `get_cli` package is a command-line interface (CLI) for Flutter that allows developers to create, manage, and deploy Flutter projects from the command line. It provides a set of tools and features that make it easier to work with Flutter projects, including creating new projects, running and debugging apps, and managing dependencies.

### When to Use get_cli

You can use `get_cli` in the following scenarios:

* Creating new Flutter projects from the command line
* Running and debugging Flutter apps from the command line
* Managing dependencies for Flutter projects
* Deploying Flutter apps to different platforms (e.g., Android, iOS, web)

### Features of get_cli

Some of the key features of `get_cli` include:

* Creating new Flutter projects with a single command
* Running and debugging Flutter apps from the command line
* Managing dependencies for Flutter projects
* Deploying Flutter apps to different platforms
* Support for different build modes (e.g., debug, release)

# Setting Up and Using get_cli
=============================

To use `get_cli`, you need to install it on your system. Here are the steps to install and set up `get_cli`:

### Installing get_cli

You can install `get_cli` using the following command:
```bash
dart pub global activate get_cli
```
This will install `get_cli` globally on your system.

### Creating a New Flutter Project

To create a new Flutter project using `get_cli`, run the following command:
```bash
get create my_app
```
This will create a new Flutter project called `my_app` in the current directory.

### Running and Debugging a Flutter App

To run a Flutter app using `get_cli`, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:
```bash
get run
```
This will run the app on the default device (e.g., emulator, simulator).

To debug a Flutter app using `get_cli`, run the following command:
```bash
get debug
```
This will start the app in debug mode.

### Managing Dependencies

To manage dependencies for a Flutter project using `get_cli`, run the following command:
```bash
get pub add <package_name>
```
This will add the specified package to the project's `pubspec.yaml` file.

### Deploying a Flutter App

To deploy a Flutter app using `get_cli`, run the following command:
```bash
get build
```
This will build the app for the default platform (e.g., Android, iOS).

```dart
// Import the necessary packages
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:get_cli/get_cli.dart';

// Define the main class
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Define the app title
  String _title = 'Real Flutter';

  // Define the app theme
  ThemeData _theme = ThemeData(
    primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
  );

  // Define the home page
  Widget _home = Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(
      title: Text('Real Flutter'),
    ),
    body: Center(
      child: Text('Welcome to Real Flutter'),
    ),
  );

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Return the app widget
    return MaterialApp(
      title: _title,
      theme: _theme,
      home: _home,
    );
  }
}

// Define the main function
void main() {
  // Create a new instance of the app
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Created/Modified files during execution:
// pubspec.yaml
// lib/main.dart
```

// The app starts by importing the necessary packages, including Flutter and get_cli.
// The main class, RealFlutter, is defined as a stateful widget.
// The app title, theme, and home page are defined as properties of the RealFlutter class.
// The build method returns the app widget, which is a MaterialApp with the specified title, theme, and home page.
// The main function creates a new instance of the app and runs it using the runApp function.
// The app's dependencies are managed using the pubspec.yaml file, which is created and modified during execution.
// The app's source code is stored in the lib/main.dart file, which is created and modified during execution.

// In summary, this code defines a basic Flutter app with a title, theme, and home page, and demonstrates how to use the get_cli package to manage the app's dependencies and build the app.
