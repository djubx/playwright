# Exploring the "get_cli" Flutter Package

## <-- START_DESCRIPTION -->

### Description

The `get_cli` package is a command-line interface tool designed to streamline the development process in Flutter applications, particularly when using the GetX state management solution. It provides developers with a set of commands to generate boilerplate code, manage routes, and handle dependency injection, making it easier to maintain a clean and organized codebase.

### When to Use

You should consider using `get_cli` when:
- You are developing a Flutter application that utilizes the GetX package for state management.
- You want to automate the creation of common files and structures, such as controllers, views, and bindings.
- You aim to improve your development workflow by reducing repetitive tasks.

### Key Features

- **Code Generation**: Automatically generate controllers, views, and bindings with simple commands.
- **Route Management**: Easily manage and navigate routes within your application.
- **Dependency Injection**: Simplify the process of injecting dependencies using GetX.
- **Customizable Templates**: Modify the generated templates to fit your project's needs.

### Tutorial

#### Installation

To get started with `get_cli`, you need to install it globally on your machine. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
pub global activate get_cli
```

#### Setting Up Your Flutter Project

1. **Create a New Flutter Project**:
   If you haven't already created a Flutter project, you can do so by running:
   ```bash
   flutter create my_flutter_app
   cd my_flutter_app
   ```

2. **Add GetX Dependency**:
   Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the GetX package:
   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     get: ^4.6.1
   ```

3. **Run Flutter Packages Get**:
   After adding the dependency, run:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

#### Using get_cli

Now that you have set up your project, you can start using `get_cli` to generate files.

1. **Generate a Controller**:
   To create a new controller, run:
   ```bash
   pub global run get_cli create controller RealController
   ```

2. **Generate a View**:
   To create a new view, run:
   ```bash
   pub global run get_cli create view RealView
   ```

3. **Generate a Binding**:
   To create a binding for your controller, run:
   ```bash
   pub global run get_cli create binding RealBinding
   ```

#### Platform-Specific Details

- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid compatibility issues.
- **iOS**: Make sure to open the iOS project in Xcode and set the deployment target to at least iOS 10.0.

#### Optimizations

- Use the generated files to maintain a clean architecture by separating your business logic (controllers) from your UI (views).
- Regularly update your dependencies to keep up with the latest features and improvements.

### Complete Example

Hereâ€™s a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the use of the `get_cli` package with the `RealFlutter` class.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:get/get.dart';

// Main entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// The main application widget
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return GetMaterialApp(
      title: 'Get CLI Example',
      initialBinding: RealBinding(), // Initial binding for dependency injection
      home: RealView(), // Home view of the application
    );
  }
}

// Controller class for managing state
class RealController extends GetxController {
  var count = 0.obs; // Observable variable to track count

  void increment() {
    count++; // Increment the count
  }
}

// View class for displaying UI
class RealView extends StatelessWidget {
  final RealController controller = Get.put(RealController()); // Injecting the controller

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Get CLI Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Obx(() => Text(
              'Count: ${controller.count}', // Displaying the count
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            )),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: controller.increment, // Increment count on button press
        tooltip: 'Increment',
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Binding class for dependency injection
class RealBinding extends Bindings {
  @override
  void dependencies() {
    Get.lazyPut<RealController>(() => RealController()); // Lazy loading the controller
  }
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the GetMaterialApp, specifying the initial binding and home view.
3. RealBinding is used to manage dependencies, ensuring that RealController is available when needed.
4. RealView is the main UI component, which uses the RealController to manage the state.
5. The count variable in RealController is observable, allowing the UI to reactively update when it changes.
6. The FloatingActionButton calls the increment method in RealController, which updates the count.
7. The Obx widget in RealView listens for changes in the count and rebuilds the Text widget to display the updated value.
