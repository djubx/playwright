# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `art_sweetalert`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `art_sweetalert` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  art_sweetalert: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

To use the `art_sweetalert` package in your Flutter application, you can import it as follows:

```dart
import 'package:art_sweetalert/art_sweetalert.dart';
```

You can then create alerts in your application using the provided methods. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to show a success alert:

```dart
ArtSweetAlert.show(
  context: context,
  type: ArtSweetAlertType.success,
  title: "Success!",
  text: "Your action was successful.",
);
```

This will display a success alert with the specified title and text.

# Complete Example of Using `art_sweetalert`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:art_sweetalert/art_sweetalert.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Art SweetAlert Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Art SweetAlert Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Show a success alert when the button is pressed
            ArtSweetAlert.show(
              context: context,
              type: ArtSweetAlertType.success,
              title: "Success!",
              text: "Your action was successful.",
              confirmButtonText: "OK",
              onConfirm: () {
                // Action to perform on confirmation
                Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the alert
              },
            );
          },
          child: Text('Show Success Alert'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. HomeScreen contains a button that, when pressed, triggers a success alert.
// 4. The alert displays a success message with an "OK" button.
// 5. When the user presses "OK", the alert closes, and the user returns to the home screen.
```

## Summary of Application Flow

The application starts with the `main` function, which initializes the `RealFlutter` widget. This widget sets up a `MaterialApp` with a title and a `HomeScreen`. The `HomeScreen` contains a button that, when pressed, displays a success alert using the `art_sweetalert` package. The alert shows a success message and an "OK" button. When the user clicks "OK," the alert closes, and the user is returned to the home screen. This flow demonstrates how to integrate and utilize the `art_sweetalert` package effectively in a Flutter application.
