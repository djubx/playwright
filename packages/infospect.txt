 Infospect Flutter Package
==========================

The Infospect Flutter package is a powerful tool for inspecting and debugging Flutter applications. It provides a simple and intuitive way to visualize and understand the layout, performance, and behavior of your app.

When to Use Infospect
--------------------

Infospect is particularly useful during the development and testing phases of your app. It can help you:

* Identify layout issues and optimize your app's UI
* Debug performance problems and improve your app's responsiveness
* Understand how your app behaves under different conditions and scenarios

Features
--------

Some of the key features of Infospect include:

* Layout inspection: visualize your app's layout hierarchy and identify potential issues
* Performance monitoring: track your app's performance and identify bottlenecks
* Behavior analysis: understand how your app behaves under different conditions and scenarios

Setup and Configuration
-----------------------

To use Infospect in your Flutter app, follow these steps:

1. Add the Infospect package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  infospect: ^1.0.0
```
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.
3. Import the Infospect package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:infospect/infospect.dart';
```
4. Initialize Infospect in your app's `main` function:
```dart
void main() {
  Infospect.init();
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```
Platform-Specific Details
-------------------------

### Android

To use Infospect on Android, you need to add the following configuration to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:
```xml
<application
  ...
  android:debuggable="true"
  ...
>
```
### iOS

To use Infospect on iOS, you need to add the following configuration to your `Info.plist` file:
```xml
<key>UIAppFonts</key>
<array>
  <string>Infospect</string>
</array>
```
Using Infospect
----------------

To use Infospect, simply call the `Infospect.show` method:
```dart
Infospect.show();
```
This will display the Infospect UI, which allows you to inspect and debug your app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:infospect/infospect.dart';

void main() {
  Infospect.init();
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Real Flutter',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Real Flutter'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              Infospect.show();
            },
            child: Text('Show Infospect'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The app starts by initializing Infospect in the main function.
// Then, it runs the RealFlutter app, which is a simple Material app.
// When the user presses the "Show Infospect" button, Infospect is displayed.
// The Infospect UI allows the user to inspect and debug the app.
// The app's layout hierarchy is displayed, and the user can select elements to view their properties.
// The user can also monitor the app's performance and analyze its behavior.
```

// In summary, the code flows as follows:
// 1. Infospect is initialized in the main function.
// 2. The RealFlutter app is run.
// 3. The user presses the "Show Infospect" button.
// 4. Infospect is displayed, showing the app's layout hierarchy.
// 5. The user can select elements to view their properties.
// 6. The user can monitor the app's performance and analyze its behavior.
