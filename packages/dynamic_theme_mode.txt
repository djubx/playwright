# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Dynamic Theme Mode

## Installation
To get started with the `dynamic_theme_mode` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dynamic_theme_mode: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No specific configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 9.0 in your `ios/Podfile`.

## Using the Package
1. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the package.
   ```dart
   import 'package:dynamic_theme_mode/dynamic_theme_mode.dart';
   ```

2. **Wrap Your App**: Use the `DynamicThemeMode` widget to wrap your main application widget.
   ```dart
   void main() {
     runApp(DynamicThemeMode(
       defaultTheme: ThemeData.light(),
       darkTheme: ThemeData.dark(),
       child: RealFlutter(),
     ));
   }
   ```

3. **Theme Switching**: Use the `DynamicThemeMode.of(context).setTheme()` method to switch themes based on user interaction.

4. **Persisting Theme**: The package automatically saves the user's theme preference, so it will persist across app restarts.

With these steps, you can easily implement dynamic theming in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Dynamic Theme Mode

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dynamic_theme_mode/dynamic_theme_mode.dart';

void main() {
  // Run the app wrapped in DynamicThemeMode to manage themes
  runApp(DynamicThemeMode(
    defaultTheme: ThemeData.light(), // Set the default theme to light
    darkTheme: ThemeData.dark(), // Set the dark theme
    child: RealFlutter(), // Main application widget
  ));
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dynamic Theme Mode Example',
      theme: DynamicThemeMode.of(context).currentTheme, // Get the current theme
      home: HomeScreen(), // Set the home screen
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Dynamic Theme Mode'),
        actions: [
          // Button to toggle between light and dark themes
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.brightness_6),
            onPressed: () {
              // Switch theme when button is pressed
              DynamicThemeMode.of(context).setTheme(
                DynamicThemeMode.of(context).currentTheme.brightness == Brightness.dark
                    ? ThemeData.light() // Switch to light theme
                    : ThemeData.dark(), // Switch to dark theme
              );
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Press the button to toggle theme!',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts in the main function, where DynamicThemeMode is initialized with light and dark themes.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is built, which sets up the MaterialApp with the current theme.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is displayed, featuring an AppBar with a button to toggle themes.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the current theme is checked, and the theme is switched accordingly.
// 5. The app remembers the user's theme preference, providing a consistent experience across sessions.
