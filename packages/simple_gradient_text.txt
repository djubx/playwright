# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Simple Gradient Text

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **simple_gradient_text** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  simple_gradient_text: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the gradient text, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:simple_gradient_text/simple_gradient_text.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using Gradient Text

You can now use the `GradientText` widget provided by the package. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use it:

```dart
GradientText(
  'Hello, Flutter!',
  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 40, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
  colors: [Colors.red, Colors.blue],
);
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

#### iOS

For iOS, make sure to enable the necessary permissions in your `Info.plist` if you are using any additional features that require permissions. However, for basic usage of the **simple_gradient_text** package, no special configurations are needed.

## Step 4: Optimizations

To optimize the performance of your Flutter app when using gradient text, consider the following:
- Use `const` constructors where possible to reduce widget rebuilds.
- Avoid excessive nesting of widgets to keep the widget tree shallow.

With these steps, you are now ready to use the **simple_gradient_text** package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Simple Gradient Text

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simple_gradient_text/simple_gradient_text.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Gradient Text Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Simple Gradient Text'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          // Centering the GradientText widget in the middle of the screen
          child: GradientText(
            'Welcome to Flutter!',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 50, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
            colors: [Colors.purple, Colors.orange], // Defining gradient colors
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application, which calls runApp().
// 2. The RealFlutter class extends StatelessWidget and builds the main UI.
// 3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp widget is created with a title.
// 4. The home property of MaterialApp is set to a Scaffold widget, which provides a structure for the app.
// 5. An AppBar is created with a title, and the body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget.
// 6. The Center widget centers its child, which is a GradientText widget.
// 7. The GradientText widget displays the text "Welcome to Flutter!" with a gradient from purple to orange.
// 8. The text style is set to a large font size and bold weight, making it visually appealing.
