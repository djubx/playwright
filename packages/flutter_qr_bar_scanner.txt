# Setup and Usage Tutorial

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_qr_bar_scanner` package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_qr_bar_scanner` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_qr_bar_scanner: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_qr_bar_scanner).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add camera permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request camera access:

   ```xml
   <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your camera to scan QR codes.</string>
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your Flutter application.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter_qr_bar_scanner/flutter_qr_bar_scanner.dart';
   ```

2. Create a widget that utilizes the scanner:

   ```dart
   class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return Scaffold(
         appBar: AppBar(title: Text('QR/Barcode Scanner')),
         body: QRBarScanner(
           onScan: (String data) {
             // Handle the scanned data
             print('Scanned data: $data');
           },
         ),
       );
     }
   }
   ```

In this example, the `QRBarScanner` widget is used to create a simple scanning interface. The `onScan` callback is triggered when a code is successfully scanned, allowing you to handle the scanned data as needed.

# Complete Example of flutter_qr_bar_scanner

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_qr_bar_scanner/flutter_qr_bar_scanner.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'QR/Barcode Scanner',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: ScannerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ScannerScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('QR/Barcode Scanner')),
      body: QRBarScanner(
        onScan: (String data) {
          // This callback is triggered when a QR code or barcode is scanned
          // Display the scanned data in a dialog
          showDialog(
            context: context,
            builder: (BuildContext context) {
              return AlertDialog(
                title: Text('Scanned Data'),
                content: Text(data),
                actions: [
                  TextButton(
                    child: Text('OK'),
                    onPressed: () {
                      Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                    },
                  ),
                ],
              );
            },
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme, and specifies ScannerScreen as the home widget.
// 3. ScannerScreen builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a QRBarScanner widget.
// 4. When a QR code or barcode is scanned, the onScan callback is triggered.
// 5. The scanned data is displayed in an AlertDialog, allowing the user to see the result and dismiss it.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this complete example, we have created a simple Flutter application that utilizes the `flutter_qr_bar_scanner` package to scan QR codes and barcodes. The application flow is straightforward:

1. The `main` function initializes the app.
2. The `RealFlutter` class sets up the main application structure.
3. The `ScannerScreen` class contains the scanning functionality.
4. When a code is scanned, the data is displayed in a dialog for the user to see.

This example demonstrates how easy it is to integrate QR and barcode scanning into your Flutter applications using the `flutter_qr_bar_scanner` package.
