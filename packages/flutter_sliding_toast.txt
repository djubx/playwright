<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# flutter_sliding_toast Package Overview

The `flutter_sliding_toast` package is a Flutter library designed to provide a customizable and visually appealing toast notification system. Toasts are small messages that pop up on the screen to provide feedback to the user without interrupting their current activity. This package allows developers to create sliding toast notifications that can be easily integrated into any Flutter application.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the `flutter_sliding_toast` package in scenarios such as:
- Providing feedback after a user action (e.g., form submission, item added to cart).
- Displaying temporary messages that do not require user interaction.
- Enhancing user experience with visually appealing notifications.

## Features

- **Customizable Appearance**: You can customize the background color, text color, and duration of the toast.
- **Sliding Animation**: The toast slides in and out, making it more engaging than traditional static toasts.
- **Positioning Options**: You can choose where the toast appears on the screen (top, center, bottom).
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that allows for quick implementation in any Flutter app.

Overall, the `flutter_sliding_toast` package is a great choice for developers looking to enhance their applications with modern and interactive notifications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_sliding_toast

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `flutter_sliding_toast` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_sliding_toast: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

To use the `flutter_sliding_toast` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_sliding_toast/flutter_sliding_toast.dart';
```

You can then create and show a sliding toast notification using the following code snippet:

```dart
SlidingToast.show(
  context,
  message: "This is a sliding toast!",
  duration: Duration(seconds: 2),
  position: ToastPosition.bottom,
);
```

### Customization Options

You can customize the toast by providing additional parameters:

```dart
SlidingToast.show(
  context,
  message: "Custom Toast!",
  duration: Duration(seconds: 3),
  position: ToastPosition.top,
  backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
  textColor: Colors.white,
);
```

This allows you to tailor the appearance and behavior of the toast to fit your application's design.

# Complete Example of flutter_sliding_toast

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_sliding_toast/flutter_sliding_toast.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sliding Toast Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Sliding Toast Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Show a sliding toast when the button is pressed
              SlidingToast.show(
                context,
                message: "Item added to cart!",
                duration: Duration(seconds: 2),
                position: ToastPosition.bottom,
                backgroundColor: Colors.green,
                textColor: Colors.white,
              );
            },
            child: Text('Add to Cart'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Sliding Toast Demo".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold has a Center widget that contains an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the SlidingToast.show() method is called to display a toast.
// 6. The toast appears at the bottom of the screen with a message "Item added to cart!" for 2 seconds.
// 7. The background color of the toast is set to green, and the text color is white.
```
