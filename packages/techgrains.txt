# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using TechGrains

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the TechGrains package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  techgrains: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configurations

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # Ensure this is set to at least 10.0
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the `RealFlutter` class from the TechGrains package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:techgrains/techgrains.dart'; // Import the package

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'TechGrains Example',
      home: RealFlutter(), // Use the RealFlutter class
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application that utilizes the TechGrains package. You can now explore the various features and functionalities provided by the package.

# Complete Example of TechGrains in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:techgrains/techgrains.dart'; // Import the TechGrains package

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'TechGrains Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(), // Main widget from TechGrains
    );
  }
}

// RealFlutter class demonstrating key features of TechGrains
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // State variable to hold data
  String _data = "Hello, TechGrains!";

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('TechGrains Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Displaying data using a TechGrains widget
            TechGrainsText(_data), // Custom widget from TechGrains
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _updateData, // Update data on button press
              child: Text('Update Data'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Method to update the state variable
  void _updateData() {
    setState(() {
      _data = "Data Updated!"; // Change the data
    });
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets MyApp as the home widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme, setting RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains a string variable _data.
// 4. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a TechGrainsText widget displays the current value of _data.
// 6. An ElevatedButton is provided to update the _data variable when pressed.
// 7. The _updateData method changes the value of _data and calls setState to refresh the UI.
```
