# Tutorial: Setting Up the Onboarding Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the Onboarding package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the Onboarding package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  onboarding: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Import the Package
In your Dart file, import the Onboarding package:

```dart
import 'package:onboarding/onboarding.dart';
```

## Step 3: Create Onboarding Screens
You can create a list of onboarding screens using the `Onboarding` widget. Each screen can be customized with images, titles, and descriptions.

### Example of Onboarding Screens
```dart
final List<OnboardingModel> onboardingData = [
  OnboardingModel(
    title: "Welcome to RealFlutter",
    description: "Discover the amazing features of our app.",
    image: "assets/images/welcome.png",
  ),
  OnboardingModel(
    title: "Stay Connected",
    description: "Connect with your friends and family easily.",
    image: "assets/images/connect.png",
  ),
  OnboardingModel(
    title: "Get Started",
    description: "Let's get you started with our app!",
    image: "assets/images/get_started.png",
  ),
];
```

## Step 4: Configure Platform-Specific Settings
### For Android
Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions and configurations. You may need to set the theme and other configurations based on your app's requirements.

### For iOS
In your `Info.plist`, you may need to add permissions for accessing certain features, such as the camera or location, depending on your app's functionalities.

## Step 5: Implement the Onboarding Flow
You can implement the onboarding flow in your main application file. Use the `Onboarding` widget to display the onboarding screens.

### Example Implementation
```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: OnboardingScreen(),
    );
  }
}
```

This setup will allow you to present the onboarding screens to users when they first launch the app.

# Complete Example of Onboarding in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:onboarding/onboarding.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Onboarding Example',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: OnboardingScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class OnboardingScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  // List of onboarding data
  final List<OnboardingModel> onboardingData = [
    OnboardingModel(
      title: "Welcome to RealFlutter",
      description: "Discover the amazing features of our app.",
      image: "assets/images/welcome.png",
    ),
    OnboardingModel(
      title: "Stay Connected",
      description: "Connect with your friends and family easily.",
      image: "assets/images/connect.png",
    ),
    OnboardingModel(
      title: "Get Started",
      description: "Let's get you started with our app!",
      image: "assets/images/get_started.png",
    ),
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Onboarding(
      pages: onboardingData,
      onFinish: () {
        // Navigate to the main application screen after onboarding
        Navigator.of(context).pushReplacement(
          MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => MainAppScreen()),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

class MainAppScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Main Application")),
      body: Center(child: Text("Welcome to the Main App!")),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The OnboardingScreen is displayed as the home screen.
// 3. The OnboardingScreen contains a list of onboarding data, which includes titles, descriptions, and images.
// 4. When the user finishes the onboarding process, the onFinish callback is triggered.
// 5. The app navigates to the MainAppScreen, which represents the main application interface.
// 6. The MainAppScreen displays a welcome message to the user.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we have created a simple onboarding flow using the Onboarding package. The application starts with the onboarding screens, guiding users through the app's features. Once the onboarding is complete, users are directed to the main application screen, enhancing their overall experience.
