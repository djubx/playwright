# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `animated_progress_bar`

## Installation
To use the `animated_progress_bar` package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  animated_progress_bar: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your progress bar is tied to any network operations. However, for basic usage, no specific configurations are needed.

## Basic Usage
To use the `animated_progress_bar`, you can import the package and create a simple progress bar in your widget tree. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_progress_bar/animated_progress_bar.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Animated Progress Bar Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: AnimatedProgressBar(
          currentValue: 70, // Current progress value
          maxValue: 100,    // Maximum value
          backgroundColor: Colors.grey[300], // Background color
          progressColor: Colors.blue, // Progress color
          animationDuration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Animation duration
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This example creates a simple animated progress bar that fills up to 70% over 2 seconds. You can customize the colors and values as needed.

# Complete Example of `animated_progress_bar`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_progress_bar/animated_progress_bar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animated Progress Bar Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  double _progress = 0; // Variable to hold the current progress value

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _startProgress(); // Start the progress when the widget is initialized
  }

  void _startProgress() async {
    // Simulate a task by incrementing the progress value
    for (int i = 0; i <= 100; i++) {
      await Future.delayed(Duration(milliseconds: 50)); // Delay for smooth animation
      setState(() {
        _progress = i.toDouble(); // Update the progress value
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Animated Progress Bar Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: AnimatedProgressBar(
          currentValue: _progress, // Current progress value
          maxValue: 100, // Maximum value
          backgroundColor: Colors.grey[300], // Background color
          progressColor: Colors.blue, // Progress color
          animationDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 50), // Animation duration
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp and points to the RealFlutter widget as the home.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that manages its own state.
// 4. In the initState method, _startProgress is called to begin the progress simulation.
// 5. _startProgress increments the progress value from 0 to 100 over time, updating the UI.
// 6. The AnimatedProgressBar widget displays the current progress with smooth animations.
```
