## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the `syncfusion_flutter_pdfviewer` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  syncfusion_flutter_pdfviewer: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/syncfusion_flutter_pdfviewer).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add the following permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you are loading PDFs from the internet:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Import the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:syncfusion_flutter_pdfviewer/pdfviewer.dart';
```

## Step 4: Basic Usage
You can now use the `SfPdfViewer` widget to display a PDF document. Here’s a simple example:

```dart
SfPdfViewer.network(
  'https://www.example.com/sample.pdf',
)
```

This will load a PDF from the specified URL. You can also load PDFs from assets or local files using `SfPdfViewer.asset` or `SfPdfViewer.file`.

## Conclusion
You are now ready to use the `syncfusion_flutter_pdfviewer` package in your Flutter applications. With its rich features and easy setup, you can provide a seamless PDF viewing experience to your users.

# Complete Example of Syncfusion Flutter PDF Viewer

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:syncfusion_flutter_pdfviewer/pdfviewer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Syncfusion PDF Viewer Example',
      home: PDFViewerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PDFViewerScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('PDF Viewer'),
      ),
      body: SfPdfViewer.network(
        // Load PDF from a network URL
        'https://www.example.com/sample.pdf',
        // Enable user interaction
        interactionMode: PdfInteractionMode.selection,
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The home screen is PDFViewerScreen, which contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body uses the SfPdfViewer.network widget to load a PDF from a specified URL.
// 5. The PDF viewer allows users to interact with the document, such as selecting text.
```

// The application starts with the `main` function, which initializes the Flutter app. The `RealFlutter` class sets up the main structure of the app, including the title. The `PDFViewerScreen` class creates a simple user interface with an AppBar and a PDF viewer. The PDF is loaded from a network URL, and users can interact with it, such as selecting text. This example demonstrates the basic functionality of the `syncfusion_flutter_pdfviewer` package, showcasing how easy it is to integrate PDF viewing capabilities into a Flutter application.
