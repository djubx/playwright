# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_carousel_intro

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_carousel_intro` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_carousel_intro: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the carousel in your app.

# Complete Example of flutter_carousel_intro

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_carousel_intro/flutter_carousel_intro.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Carousel Intro Example',
      home: CarouselIntroScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class CarouselIntroScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: CarouselIntro(
        pages: [
          // First page of the carousel
          CarouselPage(
            title: 'Welcome to Our App',
            description: 'This is the first page of our onboarding process.',
            image: AssetImage('assets/images/intro1.png'), // Replace with your image
          ),
          // Second page of the carousel
          CarouselPage(
            title: 'Explore Features',
            description: 'Discover the amazing features we offer.',
            image: AssetImage('assets/images/intro2.png'), // Replace with your image
          ),
          // Third page of the carousel
          CarouselPage(
            title: 'Get Started',
            description: 'Let\'s get started with your journey!',
            image: AssetImage('assets/images/intro3.png'), // Replace with your image
          ),
        ],
        // Optional: Enable automatic sliding
        autoPlay: true,
        // Optional: Duration for auto sliding
        autoPlayInterval: Duration(seconds: 3),
        // Optional: Show dot indicators
        showIndicators: true,
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. CarouselIntroScreen is the main screen that contains the carousel.
// 4. The CarouselIntro widget takes a list of CarouselPage widgets, each representing a page in the carousel.
// 5. Each CarouselPage has a title, description, and an image.
// 6. The carousel can automatically slide through the pages and shows indicators for navigation.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application that utilizes the `flutter_carousel_intro` package to display an onboarding carousel. The application consists of three pages, each with a title, description, and image. The carousel is set to automatically slide every three seconds, and dot indicators are shown to indicate the current page.

### Summary of Application Flow

- The app starts with the `main` function, which initializes the `RealFlutter` widget.
- The `RealFlutter` widget sets up a `MaterialApp` with a home screen that displays the `CarouselIntroScreen`.
- The `CarouselIntroScreen` contains the `CarouselIntro` widget, which takes a list of `CarouselPage` widgets.
- Each `CarouselPage` displays a title, description, and image, providing users with an engaging onboarding experience.
- The carousel automatically transitions between pages, enhancing user interaction and retention.

This structured approach to using the `flutter_carousel_intro` package allows developers to create visually appealing and functional onboarding experiences in their Flutter applications.
