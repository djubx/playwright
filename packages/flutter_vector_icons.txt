void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Vector Icons Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Vector Icons Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying a home icon from FontAwesome
              Icon(
                FontAwesome.home,
                size: 50.0, // Setting the size of the icon
                color: Colors.blue, // Setting the color of the icon
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              // Displaying a user icon from Material Icons
              Icon(
                MaterialIcons.person,
                size: 50.0, // Setting the size of the icon
                color: Colors.green, // Setting the color of the icon
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              // Displaying a settings icon from Ionicons
              Icon(
                Ionicons.md_settings,
                size: 50.0, // Setting the size of the icon
                color: Colors.red, // Setting the color of the icon
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Vector Icons Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Column widget.
// 5. Inside the Column, three Icon widgets are displayed:
//    - The first icon is a home icon from FontAwesome, colored blue.
//    - The second icon is a person icon from Material Icons, colored green.
//    - The third icon is a settings icon from Ionicons, colored red.
// 6. Each icon has a size of 50.0 and is separated by a SizedBox for spacing.
