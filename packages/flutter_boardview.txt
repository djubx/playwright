# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `flutter_boardview`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `flutter_boardview` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_boardview: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_boardview).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a board view.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_boardview/flutter_boardview.dart';
```

2. Create a new widget that utilizes `BoardView`:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter BoardView Example'),
      ),
      body: BoardView(
        rows: 5,
        columns: 5,
        itemBuilder: (context, row, column) {
          return GestureDetector(
            onTap: () {
              // Handle cell tap
              print('Tapped on cell: ($row, $column)');
            },
            child: Container(
              margin: EdgeInsets.all(4.0),
              color: Colors.blue,
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'Cell $row, $column',
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Finally, run your application to see the board view in action!

This setup provides a basic interactive board where each cell can be tapped, and the coordinates of the tapped cell will be printed to the console.

# Complete Example of `flutter_boardview`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_boardview/flutter_boardview.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter BoardView Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter BoardView Example'),
      ),
      body: BoardView(
        rows: 5, // Define the number of rows in the board
        columns: 5, // Define the number of columns in the board
        itemBuilder: (context, row, column) {
          return GestureDetector(
            onTap: () {
              // Handle cell tap
              print('Tapped on cell: ($row, $column)'); // Log the tapped cell coordinates
            },
            child: Container(
              margin: EdgeInsets.all(4.0), // Add margin around each cell
              color: Colors.blue, // Set the background color of the cell
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'Cell $row, $column', // Display the cell coordinates
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white), // Set text color
                ),
              ),
            ),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme, and specifies RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a BoardView.
// 4. The BoardView is configured with 5 rows and 5 columns, and an itemBuilder to create each cell.
// 5. Each cell is a GestureDetector that responds to taps, logging the coordinates of the tapped cell.
// 6. The cells are styled with a blue background and centered text displaying their coordinates.
```
