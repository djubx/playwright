# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Smooth Scroll Multiplatform

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `smooth_scroll_multiplatform` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `smooth_scroll_multiplatform` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  smooth_scroll_multiplatform: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable certain capabilities in your `Info.plist` file, depending on your app's requirements. However, the `smooth_scroll_multiplatform` package does not require any specific configurations for basic usage.

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:smooth_scroll_multiplatform/smooth_scroll_multiplatform.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the `SmoothScroll` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
SmoothScroll(
  child: ListView.builder(
    itemCount: 100,
    itemBuilder: (context, index) {
      return ListTile(
        title: Text('Item $index'),
      );
    },
  ),
);
```

This code snippet creates a smooth scrolling list of 100 items. You can customize the `SmoothScroll` widget further to fit your design needs.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can easily integrate the `smooth_scroll_multiplatform` package into your Flutter application, providing a better scrolling experience for your users.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
# Complete Example of Smooth Scroll Multiplatform

Below is a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the `smooth_scroll_multiplatform` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:smooth_scroll_multiplatform/smooth_scroll_multiplatform.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Smooth Scroll Example',
      home: SmoothScrollExample(),
    );
  }
}

class SmoothScrollExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Smooth Scroll Example'),
      ),
      body: SmoothScroll(
        // The SmoothScroll widget wraps the ListView to enable smooth scrolling
        child: ListView.builder(
          itemCount: 100, // Number of items in the list
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            return ListTile(
              title: Text('Item $index'), // Displaying item index
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp has a title and a home property set to SmoothScrollExample.
// 4. SmoothScrollExample is another StatelessWidget that builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 5. The body contains the SmoothScroll widget, which wraps a ListView.builder.
// 6. The ListView.builder creates a list of 100 items, each represented by a ListTile.
// 7. Each ListTile displays the index of the item, creating a simple scrollable list.
```
