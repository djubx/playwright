# Git Clone Flutter Package: A Comprehensive Guide

## <-- START_DESCRIPTION -->

### Description

The `git_clone` Flutter package is a powerful tool that allows developers to clone Git repositories directly within their Flutter applications. This package is particularly useful for applications that require version control functionalities, such as code editors, collaborative tools, or any app that needs to manage source code repositories.

### When to Use

- **Code Editors**: If you're building a code editor that needs to pull code from repositories.
- **Collaboration Tools**: For applications that facilitate team collaboration on code projects.
- **Learning Platforms**: To allow users to clone example projects or repositories for educational purposes.

### Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Utilizes Dart's async/await for non-blocking operations.
- **Error Handling**: Provides robust error handling to manage cloning failures.
- **Customizable Options**: Allows customization of clone options, such as depth and branch.

### Tutorial

To get started with the `git_clone` package, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the `git_clone` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  git_clone: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

#### Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

**For Android:**
- Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

**For iOS:**
- You may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if your app requires network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

#### Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:git_clone/git_clone.dart';
```

#### Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the `git_clone` package to clone repositories. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to do this:

```dart
void cloneRepository(String repoUrl, String localPath) async {
  try {
    // Start cloning the repository
    await GitClone.clone(repoUrl, localPath);
    print('Repository cloned successfully!');
  } catch (e) {
    print('Error cloning repository: $e');
  }
}
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:git_clone/git_clone.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Git Clone Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Git Clone Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Define the repository URL and local path
              String repoUrl = 'https://github.com/your/repo.git';
              String localPath = '/path/to/local/directory';

              // Call the clone function
              cloneRepository(repoUrl, localPath);
            },
            child: Text('Clone Repository'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to clone a repository
  void cloneRepository(String repoUrl, String localPath) async {
    try {
      // Start cloning the repository
      await GitClone.clone(repoUrl, localPath);
      print('Repository cloned successfully!');
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during cloning
      print('Error cloning repository: $e');
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'Git Clone Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget with an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, it defines the repository URL and local path.
// 6. The cloneRepository function is called with the specified URL and path.
// 7. Inside cloneRepository, the GitClone.clone method is called to clone the repository.
// 8. If successful, a success message is printed; otherwise, an error message is displayed.
```
