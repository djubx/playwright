# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using atomic_webview

## Installation
To get started with the `atomic_webview` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  atomic_webview: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/atomic_webview).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

3. If you are targeting Android 9 (API level 28) or higher, you may need to add the following to your `AndroidManifest.xml` to allow cleartext traffic:

```xml
<application
    ...
    android:usesCleartextTraffic="true">
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following key to allow arbitrary loads:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `atomic_webview` package, you can create a simple web view in your Flutter application as follows:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:atomic_webview/atomic_webview.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Atomic WebView Example'),
        ),
        body: AtomicWebView(
          initialUrl: 'https://flutter.dev',
          onPageFinished: (String url) {
            print('Page finished loading: $url');
          },
          onWebResourceError: (error) {
            print('Error loading page: $error');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that displays the Flutter website using the `AtomicWebView`. The `onPageFinished` and `onWebResourceError` callbacks allow us to handle events related to the web view.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the `atomic_webview` package in your Flutter application effectively.

# Complete Example of atomic_webview

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:atomic_webview/atomic_webview.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Atomic WebView Example'),
        ),
        body: AtomicWebView(
          initialUrl: 'https://flutter.dev', // The initial URL to load in the web view
          onPageFinished: (String url) { // Callback when the page finishes loading
            print('Page finished loading: $url'); // Log the URL of the loaded page
          },
          onWebResourceError: (error) { // Callback for web resource errors
            print('Error loading page: $error'); // Log any errors that occur
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the app
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a body.
// 3. The body contains the AtomicWebView widget, which loads the Flutter website.
// 4. When the page finishes loading, the onPageFinished callback is triggered, logging the URL.
// 5. If there is an error loading the page, the onWebResourceError callback is triggered, logging the error.
