# Complete Example of Using the Rolling Bottom Bar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:rolling_bottom_bar/rolling_bottom_bar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Rolling Bottom Bar Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  // Current index of the selected item
  int _currentIndex = 0;

  // List of screens to navigate to
  final List<Widget> _screens = [
    Center(child: Text('Home Screen')),
    Center(child: Text('Search Screen')),
    Center(child: Text('Profile Screen')),
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Rolling Bottom Bar Example'),
      ),
      body: _screens[_currentIndex], // Display the current screen
      bottomNavigationBar: RollingBottomBar(
        // Define the items in the bottom navigation bar
        items: [
          BottomNavigationBarItem(
            icon: Icon(Icons.home),
            label: 'Home',
          ),
          BottomNavigationBarItem(
            icon: Icon(Icons.search),
            label: 'Search',
          ),
          BottomNavigationBarItem(
            icon: Icon(Icons.person),
            label: 'Profile',
          ),
        ],
        currentIndex: _currentIndex, // Set the current index
        onTap: (index) {
          // Update the current index when an item is tapped
          setState(() {
            _currentIndex = index;
          });
        },
        // Customize the appearance of the bottom bar
        backgroundColor: Colors.white,
        selectedItemColor: Colors.blue,
        unselectedItemColor: Colors.grey,
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application using the rolling_bottom_bar package.
// 
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is a stateful widget that manages the current index of the bottom navigation bar.
// 4. The _screens list contains the different screens to display based on the selected navigation item.
// 5. The build method of HomeScreen returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body that displays the current screen.
// 6. The RollingBottomBar widget is used to create the bottom navigation bar, with items defined for Home, Search, and Profile.
// 7. The onTap callback updates the current index when a navigation item is tapped, triggering a rebuild of the UI to show the selected screen.
// 8. The appearance of the bottom bar is customizable, allowing for a tailored user experience.
