Here's a detailed technical blog on the "numeral" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Numeral Flutter Package

The **numeral** Flutter package is a powerful library designed to format and manipulate numbers in a user-friendly way. It provides a simple API for formatting numbers, currencies, percentages, and more, making it an essential tool for developers who need to present numerical data in a clear and consistent manner.

## When to Use the Numeral Package

You should consider using the numeral package in scenarios such as:
- Displaying financial data, where currency formatting is crucial.
- Presenting statistics or metrics that require percentage formatting.
- Formatting large numbers for better readability (e.g., adding commas).
- Converting numbers to human-readable formats (e.g., converting bytes to KB/MB).

## Features

- **Number Formatting**: Easily format numbers with thousands separators, decimal points, and more.
- **Currency Formatting**: Format numbers as currency with customizable currency symbols.
- **Percentage Formatting**: Convert numbers to percentage format with ease.
- **Custom Formats**: Create custom number formats to suit specific needs.

The numeral package simplifies the process of displaying numbers in a way that is both visually appealing and easy to understand.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Numeral Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the numeral package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  numeral: ^2.0.0
```

Then, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the numeral package:

```dart
import 'package:numeral/numeral.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

You can now use the numeral package to format numbers. Here are some examples:

```dart
void main() {
  // Formatting a number with commas
  String formattedNumber = Numeral(1234567.89).format();
  print(formattedNumber); // Output: "1,234,567.89"

  // Formatting as currency
  String formattedCurrency = Numeral(1234567.89).formatCurrency();
  print(formattedCurrency); // Output: "$1,234,567.89"

  // Formatting as percentage
  String formattedPercentage = Numeral(0.1234).formatPercentage();
  print(formattedPercentage); // Output: "12.34%"
}
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Optimizations

To optimize performance, especially when dealing with large datasets, consider caching formatted values if they are reused frequently. This can reduce the overhead of formatting numbers multiple times.

With these steps, you are now ready to use the numeral package in your Flutter applications!

# Complete Example of Using the Numeral Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:numeral/numeral.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Numeral Package Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Numeral Package Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying a formatted number
              Text(
                'Formatted Number: ${Numeral(1234567.89).format()}',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Displaying formatted currency
              Text(
                'Formatted Currency: ${Numeral(1234567.89).formatCurrency()}',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Displaying formatted percentage
              Text(
                'Formatted Percentage: ${Numeral(0.1234).formatPercentage()}',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application starts by running the RealFlutter class.
// Inside the RealFlutter class, we build a MaterialApp with a title.
// The home of the app is a Scaffold that contains an AppBar and a Center widget.
// The Center widget contains a Column that aligns its children in the center.
// We display three Text widgets, each showing a different formatted number:
// 1. A plain formatted number with commas.
// 2. A formatted currency string with a dollar sign.
// 3. A formatted percentage string.
// Each Text widget has a SizedBox for spacing, making the UI more visually appealing.
