# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_expandable_text

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `flutter_expandable_text` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_expandable_text: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the `ExpandableText` widget.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_expandable_text/flutter_expandable_text.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Expandable Text Example'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: ExpandableText(
            'This is a long text that can be expanded or collapsed. '
            'It is useful for displaying additional information without '
            'overwhelming the user. Tap to read more or less.',
            expandText: 'read more',
            collapseText: 'read less',
            maxLines: 2,
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that uses the `ExpandableText` widget to display a long text. The user can tap to expand or collapse the text.

## Conclusion

You have now set up the `flutter_expandable_text` package in your Flutter application. You can customize the text and styles as needed to fit your app's design.

# Complete Example of flutter_expandable_text

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_expandable_text/flutter_expandable_text.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Expandable Text Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Expandable Text Example'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Column(
            children: [
              // Using ExpandableText widget to display long text
              ExpandableText(
                'This is a long text that can be expanded or collapsed. '
                'It is useful for displaying additional information without '
                'overwhelming the user. Tap to read more or less.',
                expandText: 'read more', // Text shown when expanded
                collapseText: 'read less', // Text shown when collapsed
                maxLines: 2, // Maximum lines to show when collapsed
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16), // Text style
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between widgets
              // Another ExpandableText example
              ExpandableText(
                'Here is another example of expandable text. '
                'You can use this widget to show more details about a topic. '
                'It helps keep the UI clean and user-friendly.',
                expandText: 'show more',
                collapseText: 'show less',
                maxLines: 3,
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with RealFlutter as the root widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Expandable Text Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold has a Padding widget to provide space around the content.
// 5. Inside the body, a Column widget is used to stack multiple ExpandableText widgets vertically.
// 6. Each ExpandableText widget displays a long text that can be expanded or collapsed by the user.
// 7. The expandText and collapseText properties define the text shown for expanding and collapsing.
// 8. The maxLines property controls how many lines are visible when the text is collapsed.
// 9. The application provides a clean and interactive way for users to read long texts without cluttering the UI.
