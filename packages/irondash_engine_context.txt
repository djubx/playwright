# Overview of the irondash_engine_context Flutter Package

The `irondash_engine_context` package is designed to provide a robust context management solution for Flutter applications. It allows developers to manage application state and context in a more structured and efficient manner, making it easier to build scalable and maintainable applications. 

## When to Use This Package
- **Complex Applications**: When building applications with multiple layers of state management, this package can help streamline context handling.
- **Modular Architecture**: If your application follows a modular architecture, this package can facilitate better communication between modules.
- **Performance Optimization**: It can help in optimizing performance by reducing unnecessary rebuilds and managing context more effectively.

## Key Features
- **Context Management**: Simplifies the management of application context across different widgets.
- **State Preservation**: Maintains the state of the application even during navigation.
- **Modular Support**: Works well with modular architectures, allowing for better separation of concerns.
- **Performance Enhancements**: Reduces the overhead of context management, leading to smoother UI transitions.

Overall, `irondash_engine_context` is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to enhance their application's architecture and performance.

# Setting Up and Using the irondash_engine_context Package

## Installation
To get started with the `irondash_engine_context` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  irondash_engine_context: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/irondash_engine_context).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `irondash_engine_context` package, you will typically start by creating a context provider. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:irondash_engine_context/irondash_engine_context.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return EngineContextProvider(
      child: MaterialApp(
        home: HomeScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Accessing the context
    final engineContext = EngineContext.of(context);
    
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home Screen')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to the Home Screen!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we wrap our `MaterialApp` with `EngineContextProvider`, which allows us to access the context throughout the widget tree.

# Complete Example of Using irondash_engine_context

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:irondash_engine_context/irondash_engine_context.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Wrapping the app with EngineContextProvider
    return EngineContextProvider(
      child: MaterialApp(
        title: 'Irondash Engine Context Example',
        theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
        home: HomeScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Accessing the EngineContext
    final engineContext = EngineContext.of(context);
    
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home Screen')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Welcome to the Home Screen!'),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Navigating to the Detail Screen
                Navigator.push(
                  context,
                  MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => DetailScreen()),
                );
              },
              child: Text('Go to Detail Screen'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DetailScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Accessing the EngineContext again
    final engineContext = EngineContext.of(context);
    
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Detail Screen')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('This is the Detail Screen!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter wraps the MaterialApp with EngineContextProvider, allowing access to the context throughout the app.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is displayed first, which contains a button to navigate to the DetailScreen.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the app navigates to the DetailScreen, where the context can also be accessed.
// 5. Both screens can utilize the EngineContext for state management and context handling.
