# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_amazonpaymentservices

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_amazonpaymentservices` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Package to Your Project
To get started, add the `flutter_amazonpaymentservices` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_amazonpaymentservices: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the necessary permissions and metadata for Amazon payment services:

```xml
<manifest>
    <application>
        ...
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.amazon.payments.api.APP_ID"
            android:value="YOUR_AMAZON_APP_ID"/>
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.amazon.payments.api.APP_SECRET"
            android:value="YOUR_AMAZON_APP_SECRET"/>
    </application>
</manifest>
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the required configurations for Amazon payment services:

```xml
<key>AmazonPaymentServices</key>
<dict>
    <key>AppId</key>
    <string>YOUR_AMAZON_APP_ID</string>
    <key>AppSecret</key>
    <string>YOUR_AMAZON_APP_SECRET</string>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that we have set up the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. 

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_amazonpaymentservices/flutter_amazonpaymentservices.dart';
```

2. Initialize the payment service and create a payment request.

Refer to the package documentation for specific methods and classes available for handling payments.

# Complete Example of Using flutter_amazonpaymentservices

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_amazonpaymentservices/flutter_amazonpaymentservices.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Amazon Payment Services Demo',
      home: PaymentScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PaymentScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PaymentScreenState createState() => _PaymentScreenState();
}

class _PaymentScreenState extends State<PaymentScreen> {
  // This function will be called when the user initiates a payment
  void initiatePayment() async {
    // Create a payment request
    final paymentRequest = PaymentRequest(
      amount: 10.00, // Amount to be charged
      currency: 'USD', // Currency type
      orderId: 'order123', // Unique order ID
    );

    // Call the payment service to process the payment
    try {
      final paymentResponse = await AmazonPaymentService.processPayment(paymentRequest);
      // Handle the payment response
      if (paymentResponse.isSuccess) {
        // Payment was successful
        showDialog(
          context: context,
          builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
            title: Text('Payment Successful'),
            content: Text('Your payment was processed successfully!'),
            actions: [
              TextButton(
                onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                child: Text('OK'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        );
      } else {
        // Payment failed
        showDialog(
          context: context,
          builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
            title: Text('Payment Failed'),
            content: Text('Error: ${paymentResponse.errorMessage}'),
            actions: [
              TextButton(
                onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                child: Text('OK'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        );
      }
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any exceptions that occur during payment processing
      showDialog(
        context: context,
        builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
          title: Text('Error'),
          content: Text('An error occurred: $e'),
          actions: [
            TextButton(
              onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
              child: Text('OK'),
            ],
          ],
        ),
      );
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Amazon Payment Services'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: initiatePayment, // Initiate payment on button press
          child: Text('Pay with Amazon'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The PaymentScreen widget is displayed, containing a button to initiate payment.
// 3. When the button is pressed, the initiatePayment function is called.
// 4. A PaymentRequest object is created with the necessary payment details.
// 5. The payment is processed using AmazonPaymentService.processPayment.
// 6. Depending on the response, a dialog is shown indicating success or failure.
// 7. Any exceptions during the payment process are caught and displayed in a dialog.
