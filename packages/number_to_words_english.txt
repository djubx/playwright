## Setup Process

To get started with the `number_to_words_english` package, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     number_to_words_english: ^1.0.0
   ```

2. **Install the Package**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Details**:
   - **Android**: No additional configuration is required for Android. The package works out of the box.
   - **iOS**: Ensure that your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

     ```ruby
     platform :ios, '10.0'
     ```

## Using the Package

Once the package is installed, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Here’s how to implement it:

1. **Import the Package**: At the top of your Dart file, import the package:

   ```dart
   import 'package:number_to_words_english/number_to_words_english.dart';
   ```

2. **Convert Numbers**: Use the `NumberToWordsEnglish.convert()` method to convert numbers to words. Here’s a simple example:

   ```dart
   void main() {
     var number = 987654321;
     var words = NumberToWordsEnglish.convert(number);
     print(words); // Output: "nine hundred eighty-seven million six hundred fifty-four thousand three hundred twenty-one"
   }
   ```

3. **Handling Decimals**: If you need to convert decimal numbers, you can split the integer and decimal parts and convert them separately:

   ```dart
   void main() {
     var number = 1234.56;
     var parts = number.toString().split('.');
     var integerPart = NumberToWordsEnglish.convert(int.parse(parts[0]));
     var decimalPart = NumberToWordsEnglish.convert(int.parse(parts[1]));
     print('$integerPart point $decimalPart'); // Output: "one thousand two hundred thirty-four point fifty-six"
   }
   ```

This setup allows you to easily convert numbers to their English word equivalents in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:number_to_words_english/number_to_words_english.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Number to Words Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Number to Words Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: NumberToWordsWidget(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class NumberToWordsWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Define a number to convert
    var number = 123456789;

    // Convert the number to words
    var words = NumberToWordsEnglish.convert(number);

    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Text(
          'Number: $number',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20),
        Text(
          'In Words: $words',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds the NumberToWordsWidget.
// 4. The NumberToWordsWidget defines a number (123456789) and converts it to words using the NumberToWordsEnglish.convert() method.
// 5. The converted words are displayed in a Column widget, showing both the original number and its word representation.
