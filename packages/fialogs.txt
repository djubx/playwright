# fialogs Package Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the fialogs package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  fialogs: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version of the package. After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install it.

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` file to allow for any specific permissions required by your dialogs, although fialogs typically does not require special permissions.

## Basic Usage
To use fialogs in your Flutter application, you can import the package and create dialogs as needed. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to show an alert dialog:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fialogs/fialogs.dart';

void showAlert(BuildContext context) {
  Fialogs.alert(
    context: context,
    title: 'Alert Title',
    message: 'This is an alert message.',
    onConfirm: () {
      // Action on confirm
    },
  );
}
```

This function can be called from anywhere in your widget tree to display an alert dialog.

# Complete Example of fialogs in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fialogs/fialogs.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Fialogs Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Fialogs Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Trigger the alert dialog when the button is pressed
              showAlert(context);
            },
            child: Text('Show Alert'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void showAlert(BuildContext context) {
    // Display an alert dialog using fialogs
    Fialogs.alert(
      context: context,
      title: 'Alert Title',
      message: 'This is an alert message.',
      onConfirm: () {
        // Action to perform when the confirm button is pressed
        print('Alert confirmed!');
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'Fialogs Demo'.
// 4. The body contains a Center widget with an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the showAlert function is called.
// 6. The showAlert function uses fialogs to display an alert dialog with a title and message.
// 7. When the user confirms the dialog, a message is printed to the console.
