# Setting Up and Using the `flat_banners` Package

## Installation

To get started with the `flat_banners` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flat_banners: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flat_banners).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` if your banners require internet access or other specific capabilities.

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Using the Package

To use the `flat_banners` package, you can create a simple banner widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flat_banners/flat_banners.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flat Banners Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: FlatBanner(
          title: 'Special Offer!',
          subtitle: 'Get 20% off on your first purchase.',
          backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
          textColor: Colors.white,
          onTap: () {
            // Action when the banner is tapped
            print('Banner tapped!');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code creates a simple banner with a title, subtitle, and a tap action. You can customize the colors and text as needed.

# Complete Example of Using `flat_banners`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flat_banners/flat_banners.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flat Banners Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flat Banners Example')),
      body: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: [
          // Displaying the FlatBanner widget
          FlatBanner(
            title: 'Special Offer!',
            subtitle: 'Get 20% off on your first purchase.',
            backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
            textColor: Colors.white,
            onTap: () {
              // Action when the banner is tapped
              print('Banner tapped!');
            },
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between widgets
          Text('Welcome to our app!'),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme, and specifies RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body containing a FlatBanner and a Text widget.
// 4. The FlatBanner displays a promotional message and responds to taps by printing a message to the console.
// 5. The layout is responsive, and the banner will adjust based on the device's screen size.
