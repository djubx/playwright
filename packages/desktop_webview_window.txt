# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Desktop Webview Window Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `desktop_webview_window` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `desktop_webview_window` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  desktop_webview_window: ^0.4.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Setup

### For Windows

1. **Enable Desktop Embedding**: Ensure that your Flutter project is set up for desktop development. You can do this by running:
   ```bash
   flutter config --enable-windows-desktop
   ```

2. **Add Required Permissions**: You may need to modify the `CMakeLists.txt` file to include necessary permissions for the webview.

### For macOS

1. **Enable macOS Support**: Similar to Windows, ensure your project supports macOS:
   ```bash
   flutter config --enable-macos-desktop
   ```

2. **Modify Info.plist**: You may need to add permissions in the `Info.plist` file to allow network access.

### For Linux

1. **Enable Linux Support**: Ensure your project supports Linux:
   ```bash
   flutter config --enable-linux-desktop
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**: Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed for webview support.

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to create a webview window.

<!-- END_TUTORIAL -->

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:desktop_webview_window/desktop_webview_window.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Desktop Webview Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Desktop Webview Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Create a new webview window
              _openWebView();
            },
            child: Text('Open Webview'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void _openWebView() async {
    // Create a new Webview window
    final window = WebviewWindow(
      title: 'Webview Window',
      width: 800,
      height: 600,
    );

    // Load a URL in the webview
    await window.loadUrl('https://flutter.dev');

    // Show the window
    window.show();
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a simple UI containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is created. When pressed, it triggers the _openWebView method.
// 4. The _openWebView method creates a new instance of WebviewWindow, specifying the title, width, and height.
// 5. It then loads a specified URL (in this case, the Flutter homepage) into the webview.
// 6. Finally, the webview window is displayed to the user.
```
