# Safe Local Storage Flutter Package

The `safe_local_storage` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to securely store data locally on devices. It provides a simple and effective way to manage sensitive information, such as user credentials, tokens, and other private data, ensuring that it is stored securely and accessed efficiently.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `safe_local_storage` package in scenarios such as:

- **Storing User Credentials**: When you need to save user login information securely.
- **Session Management**: For storing session tokens or user preferences that require encryption.
- **Sensitive Data Handling**: When dealing with sensitive information that must be protected from unauthorized access.

## Features

- **Secure Storage**: Utilizes platform-specific secure storage mechanisms (Keychain for iOS and EncryptedSharedPreferences for Android).
- **Easy API**: Provides a straightforward API for storing and retrieving data.
- **Data Encryption**: Automatically encrypts data before storage, ensuring that sensitive information is protected.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

By leveraging the `safe_local_storage` package, developers can ensure that their applications handle sensitive data securely and efficiently.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Safe Local Storage

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `safe_local_storage` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  safe_local_storage: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions. Add the following inside the `<manifest>` tag:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

2. **Enable Encryption**: The package uses EncryptedSharedPreferences, which is enabled by default. No additional configuration is needed.

### iOS

1. **Update Info.plist**: Add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file to ensure proper access to the Keychain:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. **Enable Keychain Sharing**: If you plan to share data across apps, enable Keychain sharing in your Xcode project settings.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Hereâ€™s how to use the `safe_local_storage` package in your Flutter application:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:safe_local_storage/safe_local_storage.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  final SafeLocalStorage storage = SafeLocalStorage();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Safe Local Storage Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Store data securely
              await storage.setString('username', 'user123');
              // Retrieve data securely
              String? username = await storage.getString('username');
              print('Stored username: $username');
            },
            child: Text('Store and Retrieve Username'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that stores and retrieves a username securely using the `safe_local_storage` package.

# Complete Example of Safe Local Storage

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:safe_local_storage/safe_local_storage.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  // Create an instance of SafeLocalStorage
  final SafeLocalStorage storage = SafeLocalStorage();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Safe Local Storage Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Store data securely
              await storage.setString('username', 'user123');
              // Retrieve data securely
              String? username = await storage.getString('username');
              // Print the retrieved username
              print('Stored username: $username');
            },
            child: Text('Store and Retrieve Username'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and displays a button on the screen.
// 2. When the button is pressed, the app stores the username 'user123' securely using the SafeLocalStorage instance.
// 3. After storing, it retrieves the username from secure storage.
// 4. Finally, it prints the retrieved username to the console, demonstrating that the data was stored and retrieved successfully.
```
