// The application starts by importing the necessary packages, including the ktx package.
// It then creates instances of the cache and encryption utilities.
// The application stores a value in the cache and retrieves it, printing the result to the console.
// It then encrypts a value and decrypts it, printing the result to the console.
// Finally, the application runs the RealFlutterApp widget, which displays a simple "Hello, World!" message.

// The code flows as follows:
// 1. Import the necessary packages.
// 2. Create instances of the cache and encryption utilities.
// 3. Store a value in the cache and retrieve it.
// 4. Encrypt a value and decrypt it.
// 5. Run the RealFlutterApp widget.
