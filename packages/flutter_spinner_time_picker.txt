  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Spinner Time Picker Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              SpinnerTimePicker(
                onTimeSelected: (time) {
                  setState(() {
                    _selectedTime = time;
                  });
                },
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              Text(
                _selectedTime != null
                    ? 'Selected time: ${_selectedTime.format(context)}'
                    : 'No time selected',
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application flow:
// 1. The user runs the app and sees the `SpinnerTimePicker` widget.
// 2. The user selects a time using the spinner.
// 3. The `onTimeSelected` callback is called with the selected time.
// 4. The selected time is stored in the `_selectedTime` variable.
// 5. The UI is updated to display the selected time.
// 6. The user can select a new time, and the process repeats.

// Summary:
// The `SpinnerTimePicker` widget allows users to select a time in a convenient way.
// The selected time is stored in the `_selectedTime` variable and displayed in the UI.
// The user can select a new time, and the process repeats.
