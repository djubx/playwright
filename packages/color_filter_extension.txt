## Setup

1. **Add Dependency**

   Add the `color_filter_extension` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     color_filter_extension: ^1.0.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

### iOS

Ensure that your `ios/Podfile` has platform version set to at least 9.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
```

## Using the Package

To use the `color_filter_extension`, import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:color_filter_extension/color_filter_extension.dart';
```

### Applying a Color Filter

Here's a simple example of applying a grayscale filter to an image:

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Image.asset(
    'assets/sample.jpg',
    colorFilter: ColorFilter.mode(
      Colors.grey,
      BlendMode.saturation,
    ),
  );
}
```

# Complete Example: Flutter Main File

Below is a complete example demonstrating the key features of the `color_filter_extension` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:color_filter_extension/color_filter_extension.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutterApp());
}

class RealFlutterApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Color Filter Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: ColorFilterHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class ColorFilterHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Color Filter Extension Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display an image with a grayscale filter
            Image.asset(
              'assets/sample.jpg',
              colorFilter: ColorFilter.mode(
                Colors.grey,
                BlendMode.saturation,
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Display an image with a sepia filter
            Image.asset(
              'assets/sample.jpg',
              colorFilter: ColorFilter.mode(
                Colors.brown,
                BlendMode.modulate,
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Display an image with a custom color filter
            Image.asset(
              'assets/sample.jpg',
              colorFilter: ColorFilter.mode(
                Colors.blue.withOpacity(0.5),
                BlendMode.color,
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The `main` function is the entry point of the Flutter application.
// It calls `runApp` with an instance of `RealFlutterApp`.

// `RealFlutterApp` is a stateless widget that sets up the MaterialApp.
// It defines the app's title and theme, and specifies `ColorFilterHomePage` as the home screen.

// `ColorFilterHomePage` is a stateless widget that builds the main UI.
// It uses a `Scaffold` to provide a basic material design layout structure.

// The `AppBar` widget displays the title of the app at the top of the screen.

// The `Center` widget centers its child widgets vertically and horizontally.

// The `Column` widget arranges its children in a vertical sequence.

// Each `Image.asset` widget displays an image from the assets directory.
// The `colorFilter` property applies a color filter to the image.

// The first image uses a grayscale filter by blending with `Colors.grey` and `BlendMode.saturation`.

// The second image uses a sepia-like filter by blending with `Colors.brown` and `BlendMode.modulate`.

// The third image applies a custom blue tint using `Colors.blue.withOpacity(0.5)` and `BlendMode.color`.
