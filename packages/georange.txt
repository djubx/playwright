# Georange Flutter Package: An Overview

The `georange` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to simplify the process of working with geographical data in Flutter applications. It provides developers with the ability to calculate geographical ranges, distances, and perform geospatial queries with ease. This package is particularly useful in applications that require location-based services, such as mapping, navigation, and location tracking.

## When to Use Georange

- **Location-Based Services**: If your application needs to provide services based on the user's location, such as finding nearby restaurants or stores.
- **Geofencing**: For applications that need to trigger actions when a device enters or exits a specific geographical area.
- **Distance Calculation**: When you need to calculate the distance between two geographical points.
- **Mapping Applications**: Useful in applications that display maps and need to perform spatial queries.

## Features

- **Distance Calculation**: Compute the distance between two geographical points.
- **Geofencing**: Determine if a point is within a specified geographical boundary.
- **Spatial Queries**: Perform queries to find points within a certain range.
- **Efficient Algorithms**: Utilizes efficient algorithms to handle large datasets and perform calculations quickly.

# Setting Up and Using the Georange Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up the `georange` package in a Flutter project and demonstrate how to use its features effectively.

## Setup Process

### Step 1: Add Dependency

First, add the `georange` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  georange: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` includes the necessary permissions for accessing location data:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.app">

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/>

    <application
        android:label="app_name"
        android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher">
        <!-- Other configurations -->
    </application>
</manifest>
```

#### iOS

For iOS, update your `Info.plist` to request location permissions:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your location to provide location-based services.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your location to provide location-based services.</string>
```

### Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the `georange` package:

```dart
import 'package:georange/georange.dart';
```

## Using the Package

To use the `georange` package, you will typically create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class and utilize its methods to perform geospatial operations.

### Example Usage

```dart
void main() {
  RealFlutter geo = RealFlutter();

  // Example: Calculate distance between two points
  double distance = geo.calculateDistance(
    latitude1: 37.7749,
    longitude1: -122.4194,
    latitude2: 34.0522,
    longitude2: -118.2437,
  );

  print('Distance: $distance km');
}
```

            Text(
              'Distance between San Francisco and Los Angeles:',

            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _calculateDistance,
              child: Text('Calculate Distance'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to calculate distance between two geographical points
  void _calculateDistance() {
    // Calculate the distance using the RealFlutter class
    double distance = geo.calculateDistance(
      latitude1: 37.7749, // Latitude of San Francisco
      longitude1: -122.4194, // Longitude of San Francisco
      latitude2: 34.0522, // Latitude of Los Angeles
      longitude2: -118.2437, // Longitude of Los Angeles
    );

    // Update the result state to display the distance
    setState(() {
      result = '${distance.toStringAsFixed(2)} km';
    });
  }
}

// The application starts by running the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// The home screen is set to GeorangeExample, a stateful widget that manages the UI and logic.
// The _GeorangeExampleState class initializes an instance of RealFlutter to perform geospatial calculations.
// The build method constructs the UI, displaying a button and a text widget to show the calculated distance.
// When the button is pressed, the _calculateDistance method is called, which calculates the distance between two points using the RealFlutter instance.
// The result is then displayed on the screen by updating the state with setState.
