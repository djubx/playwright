# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Item Selector Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **item_selector** package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  item_selector: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Item Selector

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the item selector in your app.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:item_selector/item_selector.dart';
```

2. Create a stateful widget to manage the selection state:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  List<String> items = ['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3', 'Item 4'];
  List<String> selectedItems = [];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Item Selector Example')),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          ItemSelector(
            items: items,
            selectedItems: selectedItems,
            onChanged: (selected) {
              setState(() {
                selectedItems = selected;
              });
            },
          ),
          // Display selected items
          Text('Selected Items: ${selectedItems.join(', ')}'),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Run your application to see the item selector in action!

This setup provides a basic implementation of the **item_selector** package, allowing users to select items from a list and see their selections displayed on the screen.

# Complete Example of the Item Selector Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:item_selector/item_selector.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Item Selector Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // List of items to select from
  List<String> items = ['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3', 'Item 4'];
  // List to hold selected items
  List<String> selectedItems = [];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Item Selector Example')),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // ItemSelector widget for selecting items
          ItemSelector(
            items: items, // Pass the list of items
            selectedItems: selectedItems, // Pass the currently selected items
            onChanged: (selected) {
              // Callback when selection changes
              setState(() {
                selectedItems = selected; // Update the selected items
              });
            },
          ),
          // Display the selected items
          Text('Selected Items: ${selectedItems.join(', ')}'),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets MyApp as the home widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home screen.
// 3. RealFlutter is a stateful widget that maintains the state of selected items.
// 4. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Column for layout.
// 5. The ItemSelector widget is used to display the list of items for selection.
// 6. The onChanged callback updates the selectedItems list whenever the user makes a selection.
// 7. The selected items are displayed below the ItemSelector, updating in real-time as the user interacts with the selector.
