# Keyboard Avoider Flutter Package

The `keyboard_avoider` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that helps manage the keyboard's appearance and disappearance, ensuring that input fields are not obscured by the keyboard. This package is particularly useful in mobile applications where user input is frequent, such as chat applications, forms, and any interface requiring text input.

- **Forms**: When users need to fill out forms, and you want to prevent the keyboard from covering the input fields.
- **User Profiles**: In applications where users can edit their profiles, ensuring that the keyboard does not obstruct the text fields.

## Features

- **Automatic Adjustment**: The package automatically adjusts the layout when the keyboard appears or disappears.
- **Customizable Behavior**: You can customize how the layout behaves when the keyboard is shown.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Keyboard Avoider Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `keyboard_avoider` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  keyboard_avoider: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the following configuration to allow the keyboard to resize the activity:

```xml
<activity
    android:name=".MainActivity"
    android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize">
</activity>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you typically do not need to make any special configurations. However, ensure that your app's deployment target is set to a version that supports the keyboard handling features.

## Step 3: Using the Package

To use the `keyboard_avoider` package, wrap your input fields with the `KeyboardAvoider` widget. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:keyboard_avoider/keyboard_avoider.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Keyboard Avoider Example')),
        body: KeyboardAvoider(
          child: Column(
            children: [
              TextField(
                decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter your name'),
              ),
              TextField(
                decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter your message'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `KeyboardAvoider` widget ensures that the text fields are not obscured by the keyboard when it appears.

# Complete Example of Using the Keyboard Avoider Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:keyboard_avoider/keyboard_avoider.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Keyboard Avoider Example')),
        body: KeyboardAvoider(
          // The KeyboardAvoider widget wraps the entire body to manage keyboard visibility
          child: Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0), // Add padding around the input fields
            child: Column(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center, // Center the content vertically
              children: [
                TextField(
                  decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter your name'), // Input field for name
                ),
                SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between input fields
                TextField(
                  decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter your message'), // Input field for message
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'Keyboard Avoider Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains the KeyboardAvoider widget, which manages the layout when the keyboard appears.
// 5. Inside the KeyboardAvoider, a Padding widget is used to add space around the input fields.
// 6. A Column widget is used to arrange the TextFields vertically, with a SizedBox providing space between them.
// 7. When the keyboard appears, the KeyboardAvoider automatically adjusts the layout to keep the input fields visible.
