<-- START_DESCRIPTION -->

CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is a lightweight, binary, and RESTful protocol used for constrained networks and devices. The CoAP Flutter package provides a simple and efficient way to implement CoAP communication in Flutter applications.

This package is ideal for IoT (Internet of Things) applications, where devices have limited resources and need to communicate with each other or with a server. CoAP is designed to be used in resource-constrained devices and networks, making it a perfect fit for IoT applications.

Some key features of the CoAP Flutter package include:

* Support for CoAP protocol versions 1 and 2
* Support for UDP and TCP transports
* Automatic retransmission and deduplication
* Blockwise transfers for large payloads
* Observe extension for resource monitoring

To use the CoAP Flutter package, follow these steps:

1. Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  coap: ^1.0.0
```
2. Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:coap/coap.dart';
```
3. Create a CoAP client instance:
```dart
CoapClient client = CoapClient();
```
4. Set up the CoAP server URL and port:
```dart
String serverUrl = 'coap://example.com';
int serverPort = 5683;
```
5. Send a CoAP request:
```dart
CoapRequest request = CoapRequest(
  method: CoapMethod.GET,
  uri: Uri.parse('$serverUrl:$serverPort/resource'),
);
client.send(request).then((response) {
  print(response.payload);
});
```
For Android, you need to add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
```
For iOS, you need to add the following lines to your `Info.plist` file:
```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
  <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
  <true/>
</dict>
```

  void _sendRequest() {
    CoapRequest request = CoapRequest(
      method: CoapMethod.GET,
      uri: Uri.parse('$_serverUrl:$_serverPort/$_resource'),
    );
    _client.send(request).then((response) {
      setState(() {
        _response = response.payload;
      });
    });
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user opens the app and is presented with a button to send a CoAP request.
// 2. When the button is pressed, the _sendRequest function is called.
// 3. The _sendRequest function creates a CoAP request with the GET method and the specified URI.
// 4. The request is sent to the CoAP server using the _client.send method.
// 5. The response from the server is received and the payload is extracted.
// 6. The payload is displayed on the screen using the setState method.
// 7. The user can repeat the process by pressing the button again.
