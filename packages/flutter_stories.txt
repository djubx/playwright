# Setting Up and Using the Flutter Stories Package
=====================================================

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

Add the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  flutter_stories: ^1.0.0
```
Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:flutter_stories/flutter_stories.dart';
```
### Step 3: Create a Story

Create a story by creating a list of `StoryItem` objects:
```dart
List<StoryItem> storyItems = [
  StoryItem(
    content: Image.asset('assets/image1.jpg'),
    duration: Duration(seconds: 5),
  ),
  StoryItem(
    content: Text('Hello, world!'),
    duration: Duration(seconds: 3),
  ),
  StoryItem(
    content: VideoPlayer(
      videoUrl: 'https://example.com/video.mp4',
    ),
    duration: Duration(seconds: 10),
  ),
];
```
### Step 4: Create a StoryView

Create a `StoryView` widget and pass the story items to it:
```dart
StoryView(
  storyItems: storyItems,
  onStoryCompleted: () {
    print('Story completed!');
  },
)
```
### Platform-Specific Details

* Android: Make sure to add the `android.permission.INTERNET` permission to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file if you're using video content.
* iOS: Make sure to add the `NSAppTransportSecurity` key to your `Info.plist` file if you're using video content.

### Optimizations

* Use caching to improve performance when loading images and videos.
* Use a placeholder image or text while loading content to improve user experience.

        storyItems: storyItems,
        onStoryCompleted: () {
          print('Story completed!');
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application flow:
// 1. The user opens the app and is presented with a story view.
// 2. The story view displays the first story item, which is an image.
// 3. After 5 seconds, the story view automatically navigates to the next story item, which is a text.
// 4. After 3 seconds, the story view automatically navigates to the next story item, which is a video.
// 5. After 10 seconds, the story view completes and the onStoryCompleted callback is called.
// 6. The user can then interact with the app, such as navigating back to the previous story item or closing the app.
```
