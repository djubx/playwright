# Tutorial: Setting Up gma_mediation_meta

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `gma_mediation_meta` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `gma_mediation_meta` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  gma_mediation_meta: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Add the necessary permissions and metadata in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.

   ```xml
   <manifest>
       <application>
           <!-- Add this line for ad mediation -->
           <meta-data
               android:name="com.google.android.gms.ads.APPLICATION_ID"
               android:value="YOUR_ADMOB_APP_ID"/>
       </application>
   </manifest>
   ```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure that your `android/build.gradle` file includes the Google services classpath:

   ```groovy
   buildscript {
       dependencies {
           classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.10' // Check for the latest version
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Apply Plugin**: In your `android/app/build.gradle`, apply the Google services plugin at the bottom:

   ```groovy
   apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following keys:

   ```xml
   <key>GADApplicationIdentifier</key>
   <string>YOUR_ADMOB_APP_ID</string>
   ```

2. **CocoaPods**: Ensure you have the necessary pods installed. Run the following command in your `ios` directory:

   ```bash
   pod install
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. 

1. **Import the Package**:

   ```dart
   import 'package:gma_mediation_meta/gma_mediation_meta.dart';
   ```

2. **Initialize the SDK**:

   You need to initialize the mediation SDK in your main application file:

   ```dart
   void main() {
     WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
     GmaMediationMeta.initialize();
     runApp(MyApp());
   }
   ```

3. **Load and Show Ads**:

   You can now load and show ads using the provided methods. For example:

   ```dart
   GmaMediationMeta.loadInterstitialAd();
   ```

This will load an interstitial ad, which you can then display when appropriate.

# Complete Example

Here’s a complete example of a Flutter application using the `gma_mediation_meta` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gma_mediation_meta/gma_mediation_meta.dart';

void main() {
  // Ensure Flutter binding is initialized before running the app
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  
  // Initialize the GMA Mediation SDK
  GmaMediationMeta.initialize();
  
  // Run the main application
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'GMA Mediation Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  // Variable to track if the ad is loaded
  bool _isAdLoaded = false;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Load an interstitial ad when the screen initializes
    _loadAd();
  }

  void _loadAd() {
    // Load an interstitial ad
    GmaMediationMeta.loadInterstitialAd().then((ad) {
      setState(() {
        _isAdLoaded = true; // Update the state when the ad is loaded
      });
    }).catchError((error) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during ad loading
      print("Error loading ad: $error");
    });
  }

  void _showAd() {
    // Show the loaded ad if available
    if (_isAdLoaded) {
      GmaMediationMeta.showInterstitialAd().then((_) {
        // Ad shown successfully
        print("Ad shown successfully");
        _loadAd(); // Load a new ad after showing the current one
      }).catchError((error) {
        // Handle any errors that occur while showing the ad
        print("Error showing ad: $error");
      });
    } else {
      print("Ad not loaded yet");
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('GMA Mediation Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _showAd, // Show ad when button is pressed
          child: Text('Show Interstitial Ad'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts by initializing the GMA Mediation SDK.
// 2. The HomeScreen widget is displayed, which loads an interstitial ad in its initState.
// 3. When the user presses the button, the app checks if the ad is loaded.
// 4. If the ad is loaded, it is displayed; otherwise, a message is printed.
// 5. After showing the ad, a new ad is loaded for future use.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application that initializes the `gma_mediation_meta` package, loads an interstitial ad, and displays it when the user presses a button. The comments within the code explain each step of the application flow, making it easy to understand how the package works in practice. 

### Final Summary

The `gma_mediation_meta` package simplifies the process of integrating ad mediation into Flutter applications. By following the setup and usage instructions provided, developers can efficiently manage ads from multiple networks, optimizing their monetization strategies while maintaining a clean and organized codebase.
