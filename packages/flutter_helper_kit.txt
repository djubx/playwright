# Getting Started with Flutter Helper Kit

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **flutter_helper_kit** and demonstrate how to use its features effectively.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **flutter_helper_kit** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_helper_kit: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configurations

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the package to start using it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_helper_kit/flutter_helper_kit.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the various features of the **flutter_helper_kit**. For example, to create a custom button with animation, you can use the `AnimatedButton` widget provided by the package:

```dart
AnimatedButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // Your action here
  },
  child: Text('Click Me'),
);
```

This button will have a smooth transition effect when pressed, enhancing the user experience.

By following these steps, you can easily integrate the **flutter_helper_kit** into your Flutter application and start utilizing its powerful features.

# Complete Example of Flutter Helper Kit

Below is a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the **flutter_helper_kit**.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_helper_kit/flutter_helper_kit.dart'; // Importing the package

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp()); // Starting the application
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Helper Kit Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(), // Setting the home page
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Helper Kit Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Using the AnimatedButton from flutter_helper_kit
            AnimatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action when button is pressed
                showDialog(
                  context: context,
                  builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                    title: Text('Hello!'),
                    content: Text('You pressed the button!'),
                    actions: <Widget>[
                      TextButton(
                        onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                        child: Text('Close'),
                      ),
                    ],
                  ),
                );
              },
              child: Text('Press Me'), // Button text
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between widgets
            // Using a utility function to format the current date
            Text(
              'Current Date: ${DateHelper.formatDate(DateTime.now())}', // Displaying formatted date
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home page is set to HomePage, which contains the main UI.
// 4. HomePage builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the widgets vertically.
// 6. An AnimatedButton is created, which shows a dialog when pressed.
// 7. Below the button, the current date is displayed using a utility function from the package.
// 8. The application demonstrates the use of both a custom widget and a utility function from flutter_helper_kit.
```
