# Complete Example of Alphabet List View

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:alphabet_list_view/alphabet_list_view.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Alphabet List View Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Alphabet List View'),
        ),
        body: AlphabetListView(
          showPreview: false, // Disable preview for simplicity
          itemBuilder: (context, item) {
            return ListTile(
              title: Text(item),
            );
          },
          indexedItems: [
            'Apple',
            'Banana',
            'Cherry',
            'Date',
            'Fig',
            'Grape',
            'Kiwi',
            'Lemon',
            'Mango',
            'Nectarine',
            'Orange',
            'Papaya',
            'Quince',
            'Raspberry',
            'Strawberry',
            'Tomato',
            'Ugli fruit',
            'Vanilla',
            'Watermelon',
            'Xigua',
            'Yellow passion fruit',
            'Zucchini',
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body uses the AlphabetListView widget to display a list of fruits.
// 5. The itemBuilder function creates a ListTile for each item in the indexedItems list.
// 6. The indexedItems list contains a variety of fruits, which are displayed in alphabetical order.
// 7. The user can scroll through the list and tap on any fruit to see its details (if implemented).
// 8. The showPreview property is set to false to simplify the example, but it can be enabled for a better user experience.
