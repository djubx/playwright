# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Phone Form Field Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `phone_form_field` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  phone_form_field: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/phone_form_field).

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to access the internet and read phone state if needed. Add the following lines inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you are accessing device features. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSContactsUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to contacts to provide phone number suggestions.</string>
```

## Step 4: Using the Phone Form Field

Now that you have set up the package, you can use the `PhoneFormField` widget in your application. Here’s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:phone_form_field/phone_form_field.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Phone Form Field Example')),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: PhoneFormField(
            decoration: InputDecoration(
              labelText: 'Phone Number',
              border: OutlineInputBorder(),
            ),
            onChanged: (phone) {
              // Handle phone number changes
              print('Phone number: ${phone?.number}');
            },
            validator: (phone) {
              // Validate the phone number
              if (phone == null || phone.number.isEmpty) {
                return 'Please enter a valid phone number';
              }
              return null;
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that includes a phone number input field. The `PhoneFormField` widget handles the formatting and validation of the phone number.

# Complete Example of Phone Form Field

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:phone_form_field/phone_form_field.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Phone Form Field Example')),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: PhoneFormField(
            decoration: InputDecoration(
              labelText: 'Phone Number', // Label for the input field
              border: OutlineInputBorder(), // Styling the input field
            ),
            onChanged: (phone) {
              // This callback is triggered when the phone number changes
              print('Phone number: ${phone?.number}'); // Print the phone number to console
            },
            validator: (phone) {
              // Validate the phone number input
              if (phone == null || phone.number.isEmpty) {
                return 'Please enter a valid phone number'; // Error message if validation fails
              }
              return null; // Return null if validation passes
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the `RealFlutter` class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The `MaterialApp` widget is created, providing the basic structure of the app.
// 3. A `Scaffold` widget is used to create the app's visual layout, including an AppBar and body.
// 4. Inside the body, a `PhoneFormField` widget is added, which allows users to input their phone numbers.
// 5. The `decoration` property customizes the appearance of the input field.
// 6. The `onChanged` callback captures the phone number input and prints it to the console.
// 7. The `validator` function checks if the phone number is valid and returns an error message if not.
// 8. The app is ready to run, and users can input their phone numbers with real-time validation and formatting.
```
