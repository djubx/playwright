Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that the package is set up, you can start using it in your application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the seat booking functionality.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:book_my_seat/book_my_seat.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Book My Seat Example',
      home: SeatBookingScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class SeatBookingScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SeatBookingScreenState createState() => _SeatBookingScreenState();
}

class _SeatBookingScreenState extends State<SeatBookingScreen> {
  List<Seat> seats = []; // List to hold seat data
  List<int> selectedSeats = []; // List to hold selected seat IDs

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize seat data
    seats = List.generate(20, (index) => Seat(id: index, isAvailable: true));
  }

  void onSeatSelected(int seatId) {
    setState(() {
      if (selectedSeats.contains(seatId)) {
        selectedSeats.remove(seatId); // Deselect seat
      } else {
        selectedSeats.add(seatId); // Select seat
      }
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Select Your Seats')),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          Expanded(
            child: SeatLayout(
              seats: seats,
              onSeatSelected: onSeatSelected,
              selectedSeats: selectedSeats,
            ),
          ),
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Handle booking confirmation
              print('Selected Seats: $selectedSeats');
            },
            child: Text('Confirm Booking'),
          ),

# Complete Example of Book My Seat Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:book_my_seat/book_my_seat.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Book My Seat Example',
      home: SeatBookingScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class SeatBookingScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SeatBookingScreenState createState() => _SeatBookingScreenState();
}

class _SeatBookingScreenState extends State<SeatBookingScreen> {
  List<Seat> seats = []; // List to hold seat data
  List<int> selectedSeats = []; // List to hold selected seat IDs

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize seat data
    seats = List.generate(20, (index) => Seat(id: index, isAvailable: true));
  }

  void onSeatSelected(int seatId) {
    setState(() {
      if (selectedSeats.contains(seatId)) {
        selectedSeats.remove(seatId); // Deselect seat
      } else {
        selectedSeats.add(seatId); // Select seat
      }
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Select Your Seats')),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          Expanded(
            child: SeatLayout(
              seats: seats,
              onSeatSelected: onSeatSelected,
              selectedSeats: selectedSeats,
            ),
          ),
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Handle booking confirmation
              print('Selected Seats: $selectedSeats');
            },
            child: Text('Confirm Booking'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The SeatBookingScreen is displayed, where users can select seats.
// 3. The initState method initializes a list of available seats.
// 4. The onSeatSelected method updates the selectedSeats list based on user interaction.
// 5. The SeatLayout widget displays the seats and allows users to select or deselect them.
// 6. When the "Confirm Booking" button is pressed, the selected seat IDs are printed to the console.
