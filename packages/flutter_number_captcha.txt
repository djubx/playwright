# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_number_captcha

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_number_captcha` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_number_captcha` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_number_captcha: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you are using any features that require user permissions. However, for basic usage of the `flutter_number_captcha`, no additional permissions are required.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the number CAPTCHA in your app.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_number_captcha/flutter_number_captcha.dart';
```

2. Create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class and use it in your widget tree.

# Complete Example of flutter_number_captcha

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_number_captcha/flutter_number_captcha.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Number Captcha Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: CaptchaDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class CaptchaDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CaptchaDemoState createState() => _CaptchaDemoState();
}

class _CaptchaDemoState extends State<CaptchaDemo> {
  // Variable to hold the CAPTCHA result
  String captchaResult = '';
  // Controller for the text field
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Number CAPTCHA Demo'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the CAPTCHA
            NumberCaptcha(
              onChanged: (value) {
                // Update the captcha result when the user inputs a value
                setState(() {
                  captchaResult = value;
                });
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Text field for user input
            TextField(
              controller: _controller,
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Enter CAPTCHA',
                border: OutlineInputBorder(),
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to verify the CAPTCHA
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Check if the entered CAPTCHA matches the generated one
                if (_controller.text == captchaResult) {
                  // Show success message
                  ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                    SnackBar(content: Text('CAPTCHA Verified!')),
                  );
                } else {
                  // Show error message
                  ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                    SnackBar(content: Text('CAPTCHA Incorrect!')),
                  );
                }
              },
              child: Text('Verify CAPTCHA'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
// Explanation of the application flow:

// 1. The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `MyApp` widget.
// 2. `MyApp` sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme, and specifies `CaptchaDemo` as the home widget.
// 3. In `CaptchaDemo`, we maintain a state that holds the CAPTCHA result and a text controller for user input.
// 4. The `NumberCaptcha` widget generates a CAPTCHA and calls `onChanged` whenever the user inputs a value, updating the `captchaResult`.
// 5. A `TextField` allows the user to enter the CAPTCHA they see.
// 6. When the user presses the "Verify CAPTCHA" button, we compare the input with the generated CAPTCHA.
// 7. If they match, a success message is displayed; otherwise, an error message is shown.
```
