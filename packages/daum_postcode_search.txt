# Complete Example of daum_postcode_search

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:daum_postcode_search/daum_postcode_search.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Daum Postcode Search')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Open the Daum Postcode search
              final result = await DaumPostcodeSearch.showPostcodePicker();
              if (result != null) {
                // Handle the selected address
                print('Selected Address: ${result.address}');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Search Address'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the `RealFlutter` widget, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The `MaterialApp` widget is created, providing the basic structure of the app.
// 3. A `Scaffold` widget is used to create the app's visual layout, including an AppBar and a body.
// 4. In the body, a centered `ElevatedButton` is displayed with the text 'Search Address'.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the `onPressed` callback is triggered.
// 6. Inside the callback, the `DaumPostcodeSearch.showPostcodePicker()` method is called to open the postcode search interface.
// 7. If the user selects an address, the result is returned and printed to the console.
// 8. This simple flow allows users to search for and select postal addresses easily.
