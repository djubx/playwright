# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Terra Flutter Bridge

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **terra_flutter_bridge** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **terra_flutter_bridge** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  terra_flutter_bridge: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure that you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. Ensure that your iOS deployment target is set to at least 11.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '11.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in our Flutter application.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:terra_flutter_bridge/terra_flutter_bridge.dart';
```

2. Initialize the package and create a wallet:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Terra Flutter Bridge Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initialize the Terra Bridge
              final terraBridge = TerraFlutterBridge();

              // Create a new wallet
              final wallet = await terraBridge.createWallet();
              print('Wallet created: ${wallet.address}');
            },
            child: Text('Create Wallet'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that initializes the Terra Flutter Bridge and creates a new wallet when the button is pressed.

# Complete Example: Terra Flutter Bridge in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:terra_flutter_bridge/terra_flutter_bridge.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Terra Flutter Bridge Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initialize the Terra Bridge
              final terraBridge = TerraFlutterBridge();

              // Create a new wallet
              final wallet = await terraBridge.createWallet();
              print('Wallet created: ${wallet.address}');

              // Send tokens (example values)
              final recipientAddress = 'terra1...'; // Replace with actual address
              final amount = 1000000; // Amount in smallest unit (e.g., uLUNA)

              // Send tokens
              final transactionResult = await terraBridge.sendTokens(
                wallet: wallet,
                recipient: recipientAddress,
                amount: amount,
              );
              print('Transaction result: $transactionResult');
            },
            child: Text('Create Wallet and Send Tokens'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and displays a button on the screen.
// 2. When the button is pressed, the TerraFlutterBridge is initialized.
// 3. A new wallet is created, and its address is printed to the console.
// 4. The app then attempts to send tokens to a specified recipient address.
// 5. The transaction result is printed to the console, indicating success or failure.
```
