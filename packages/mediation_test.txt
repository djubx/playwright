                onPressed: _loadAd,
                child: Text('Load Ad'),
              ),
              // Show ad button
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _showAd,
                child: Text('Show Ad'),

            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The app flow is as follows:
// 1. The user opens the app and the mediation test package is initialized.
// 2. The user clicks the "Load Ad" button, which loads an ad using the mediation test instance.
// 3. The user clicks the "Show Ad" button, which shows the loaded ad.
// 4. The ad is displayed to the user.
// 5. The user can interact with the ad, such as clicking on it.
// 6. The ad revenue is generated and reported to the developer.

// This code demonstrates the basic usage of the mediation test package,
// including loading and showing ads. It also demonstrates how to handle
// ad revenue and report it to the developer.
