// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a list of pricing plans.
// 2. Each pricing plan is displayed as a card with a title, price, and features.
// 3. The user can view the details of each plan by looking at the features listed.
// 4. If a plan has a badge, it is displayed on the card.
// 5. If a plan has a button, it is displayed on the card and can be pressed to take action.
// 6. The user can scroll through the list of plans to view all options.
// 7. The app does not handle any actual sign-ups or payments, it is just a demo.
