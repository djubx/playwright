# Loading More List Flutter Package

The `loading_more_list` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to simplify the implementation of infinite scrolling lists in Flutter applications. This package allows developers to load more items dynamically as the user scrolls down the list, enhancing the user experience by providing a seamless way to access additional content without the need for pagination.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `loading_more_list` package in scenarios where:
- You have a large dataset that cannot be loaded all at once due to performance concerns.
- You want to provide a smooth user experience by loading data in chunks as the user scrolls.
- You need to implement features like pull-to-refresh or loading indicators while fetching data.

## Features

- **Infinite Scrolling**: Automatically loads more items as the user scrolls down.
- **Customizable Loading Indicators**: Easily customize the loading indicators to match your app's design.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in support for handling errors during data fetching.
- **Pull-to-Refresh**: Supports pull-to-refresh functionality to reload the list.

Overall, the `loading_more_list` package is an excellent choice for developers looking to implement efficient and user-friendly scrolling lists in their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Loading More List Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `loading_more_list` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `loading_more_list` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  loading_more_list: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your `ios/Podfile` has the platform set to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:loading_more_list/loading_more_list.dart';
```

## Step 4: Create Your Data Source

You need to create a data source that extends `LoadingMoreBase`. This class will handle the logic for loading more items.

```dart
class MyDataSource extends LoadingMoreBase<MyItem> {
  // Implement the required methods here
}
```

## Step 5: Use the LoadingMoreList Widget

Now, you can use the `LoadingMoreList` widget in your UI:

```dart
LoadingMoreList<MyItem>(
  ListConfig<MyItem>(
    itemBuilder: (context, item, index) => MyItemWidget(item),
    source: myDataSource,
    // Additional configurations
  ),
)
```

## Step 6: Run Your Application

After setting everything up, run your application using:

```bash
flutter run
```

This will launch your app with the loading more list functionality implemented.

# Complete Example of Loading More List

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:loading_more_list/loading_more_list.dart';

// Main entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// MyApp widget that sets up the MaterialApp
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Loading More List Example',
      home: RealFlutter(), // Main screen of the app
    );
  }
}

// RealFlutter widget that implements the loading more list
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Loading More List Example'),
      ),
      body: LoadingMoreList<MyItem>(
        ListConfig<MyItem>(
          itemBuilder: (context, item, index) => MyItemWidget(item),
          source: MyDataSource(), // Data source for loading items
          // Additional configurations can be added here
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// MyItem class representing the data model
class MyItem {
  final String title;

  MyItem(this.title);
}

// MyItemWidget to display each item in the list
class MyItemWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  final MyItem item;

  MyItemWidget(this.item);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ListTile(
      title: Text(item.title), // Display the title of the item
    );
  }
}

// MyDataSource class to handle loading more items
class MyDataSource extends LoadingMoreBase<MyItem> {
  int _page = 0; // Current page number
  final int _limit = 20; // Number of items to load per request

  @override
  bool get hasMore => _page < 5; // Example condition for more items

  @override
  Future<bool> loadData(int startIndex, int count) async {
    // Simulate network delay
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));

    // Load items and add them to the list
    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
      if (hasMore) {
        add(MyItem('Item ${_page * _limit + i + 1}'));
      }
    }
    _page++; // Increment page number
    return true; // Indicate that data was loaded successfully
  }
}

// Explanation of the application flow
/*
1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
2. MyApp sets up a MaterialApp with a title and the RealFlutter widget as the home.
3. The RealFlutter widget contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a LoadingMoreList.
4. The LoadingMoreList uses a ListConfig to define how items are built and where to source them from.
5. MyDataSource is responsible for loading more items when the user scrolls down.
6. Each item is represented by the MyItem class, and displayed using the MyItemWidget.
7. The loadData method in MyDataSource simulates a network call and adds new items to the list.
8. The hasMore property determines if there are more items to load based on the current page.
