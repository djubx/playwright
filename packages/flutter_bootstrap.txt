# Setting Up and Using the Flutter Bootstrap Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_bootstrap` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter applications.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_bootstrap` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_bootstrap: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart files where you want to use the package, import it as follows:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_bootstrap/flutter_bootstrap.dart';
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now start using the `flutter_bootstrap` package in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to create a responsive layout using the Bootstrap grid system.

# Complete Example of Using Flutter Bootstrap

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_bootstrap/flutter_bootstrap.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Bootstrap Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Bootstrap Example'),
        ),
        body: BootstrapContainer(
          // Container to hold the grid layout
          fluid: true, // Use fluid container for full width
          children: [
            BootstrapRow(
              // Create a row in the grid
              children: [
                BootstrapCol(
                  // First column
                  sizes: 'col-12 col-md-6', // Responsive sizes
                  child: Container(
                    color: Colors.red,
                    padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
                    child: Text('Column 1', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white)),
                  ),
                ),
                BootstrapCol(
                  // Second column
                  sizes: 'col-12 col-md-6',
                  child: Container(
                    color: Colors.blue,
                    padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
                    child: Text('Column 2', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white)),
                  ),
                ),
              ],
            ),
            BootstrapRow(
              // Another row
              children: [
                BootstrapCol(
                  sizes: 'col-12',
                  child: Container(
                    color: Colors.green,
                    padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
                    child: Text('Full Width Column', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white)),
                  ),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a body that uses BootstrapContainer for responsive layout.
// 4. Inside the BootstrapContainer, we define BootstrapRows and BootstrapCols to create a grid layout.
// 5. Each BootstrapCol can have different sizes based on the screen width, allowing for a responsive design.
// 6. The first row has two columns that take half the width on medium and larger screens, and full width on smaller screens.
// 7. The second row has a single column that takes the full width, demonstrating how to stack elements vertically.
