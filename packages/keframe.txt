# Understanding the `keframe` Flutter Package

The `keframe` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to optimize their application's rendering performance. It is particularly useful in scenarios where complex animations or heavy UI updates can lead to frame drops and janky user experiences. By leveraging `keframe`, developers can ensure smoother animations and transitions by intelligently managing frame rendering.

## When to Use `keframe`

- **Complex Animations**: When your app involves intricate animations that might cause frame drops.
- **Heavy UI Updates**: In cases where the UI undergoes frequent and substantial changes.
- **Performance Optimization**: To enhance the overall performance of your Flutter application by reducing jank.

## Key Features

- **Frame Management**: Efficiently manages frame rendering to ensure smooth animations.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate into existing Flutter projects.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

# Setting Up and Using the `keframe` Package

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `keframe` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter projects.

## Installation

To get started, add `keframe` to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  keframe: ^latest_version
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Setup

### Android

No additional setup is required for Android. Ensure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, ensure your deployment target is set to at least iOS 9.0. You can set this in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
```

## Using `keframe` in Your Project

To use `keframe`, wrap your widgets with `RealFlutter` to manage frame rendering:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:keframe/keframe.dart';

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return FrameSeparateWidget(
      child: MaterialApp(
        home: RealFlutter(
          child: MyHomePage(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, `RealFlutter` is used to wrap the `MyHomePage` widget, ensuring that frame rendering is optimized.

# Complete Example: Flutter Main File with `keframe`

Below is a complete example demonstrating the use of the `keframe` package in a Flutter application.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:keframe/keframe.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // FrameSeparateWidget is used to manage frame rendering
    return FrameSeparateWidget(
      child: MaterialApp(
        title: 'Keframe Demo',
        theme: ThemeData(
          primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
        ),
        home: RealFlutter(
          child: MyHomePage(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Scaffold provides the basic structure for the app
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Keframe Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        // RealFlutter widget optimizes the rendering of its child
        child: RealFlutter(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text(
                'Smooth Animation Example',
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Example of an animated widget
              AnimatedContainer(
                duration: Duration(seconds: 1),
                width: 100,
                height: 100,
                color: Colors.blue,
                child: Center(child: Text('Animate')),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a FrameSeparateWidget.
// 3. FrameSeparateWidget ensures that frame rendering is managed efficiently.
// 4. The home property of MaterialApp is set to a RealFlutter widget wrapping MyHomePage.
// 5. MyHomePage is a StatefulWidget that builds the main UI of the app.
// 6. The Scaffold widget provides the basic structure with an AppBar and a body.
// 7. The body contains a Center widget with a RealFlutter widget to optimize rendering.
// 8. Inside RealFlutter, a Column widget displays text and an AnimatedContainer.
// 9. The AnimatedContainer demonstrates a simple animation, optimized by RealFlutter.
