# Keframe Flutter Package
The keframe package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers, providing a simple and efficient way to manage the lifecycle of widgets. It allows developers to easily create, update, and destroy widgets, making it a valuable asset for building complex and dynamic user interfaces.

## When to Use Keframe
Keframe is particularly useful when building applications with multiple widgets that need to be updated or changed dynamically. For example, in a social media app, keframe can be used to manage the lifecycle of posts, comments, and likes. It can also be used in games to manage the lifecycle of game objects, such as characters, obstacles, and power-ups.

## Features of Keframe
Some of the key features of keframe include:

*   Automatic widget lifecycle management
*   Easy widget creation and destruction
*   Support for multiple widget types
*   Customizable widget updating and rendering

# Setting Up Keframe
To use keframe in your Flutter project, follow these steps:

1.  Add the keframe package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

    ```yml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  keframe: ^1.0.0
```

2.  Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.
3.  Import the keframe package in your Dart file:

    ```dart
import 'package:keframe/keframe.dart';
```

## Using Keframe
To use keframe, you need to create a `Keframe` widget and pass it a list of `KeframeItem` widgets. Each `KeframeItem` widget represents a single widget that will be managed by keframe.

Here is an example of how to use keframe:

```dart
Keframe(
  children: [
    KeframeItem(
      child: Text('Widget 1'),
    ),
    KeframeItem(
      child: Text('Widget 2'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

## Platform-Specific Details
Keframe works on both Android and iOS platforms. However, there are some platform-specific details to keep in mind:

*   On Android, keframe uses the ` android.view.View` class to render widgets.
*   On iOS, keframe uses the `UIView` class to render widgets.

## Configurations and Optimizations
Keframe provides several configurations and optimizations that can be used to improve performance and customize behavior. These include:

*   `KeframeOptions`: This class provides options for customizing the behavior of keframe, such as the animation duration and the widget updating strategy.
*   `KeframeController`: This class provides a way to programmatically control the lifecycle of widgets managed by keframe.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:keframe/keframe.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Keframe Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  List<KeframeItem> _items = [
    KeframeItem(
      child: Text('Widget 1'),
    ),
    KeframeItem(
      child: Text('Widget 2'),
    ),
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Keframe Demo'),
      ),
      body: Keframe(
        children: _items,
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          setState(() {
            _items.add(KeframeItem(
              child: Text('Widget ${_items.length + 1}'),
            ));
          });
        },
        tooltip: 'Add Widget',
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a list of two widgets.
// 2. The user can add new widgets to the list by pressing the floating action button.
// 3. When a new widget is added, the keframe package automatically updates the list and renders the new widget.
// 4. The user can continue to add new widgets, and the keframe package will continue to manage the lifecycle of each widget.
// 5. The keframe package also provides options for customizing the behavior of the widgets, such as animation duration and widget updating strategy.

// In summary, the keframe package provides a simple and efficient way to manage the lifecycle of widgets in a Flutter app.
// It allows developers to easily create, update, and destroy widgets, making it a valuable asset for building complex and dynamic user interfaces.
