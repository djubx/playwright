Here's a detailed technical blog on the "injector" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Injector Flutter Package

The **injector** package is a powerful dependency injection library for Flutter applications. It simplifies the management of dependencies, making it easier to write clean, maintainable, and testable code. Dependency injection is a design pattern that allows a class to receive its dependencies from an external source rather than creating them internally. This promotes loose coupling and enhances the modularity of your application.

## When to Use the Injector Package

You should consider using the injector package in scenarios such as:

- **Large Applications**: When your application grows in size and complexity, managing dependencies manually can become cumbersome. The injector package helps streamline this process.
- **Testing**: It allows for easier mocking of dependencies during unit testing, making your tests more reliable and easier to write.
- **Modular Architecture**: If you are following a modular architecture, the injector package can help manage dependencies across different modules effectively.

## Features

- **Simple API**: The injector package provides a straightforward API for registering and resolving dependencies.
- **Scoped Instances**: You can create scoped instances that are only available within a specific context, which is useful for managing state.
- **Lazy Loading**: Dependencies can be lazily loaded, improving the performance of your application by only creating instances when needed.

# Tutorial: Setting Up the Injector Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the injector package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  injector: ^6.0.0
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Basic Setup

In your Flutter application, you will typically set up the injector in the `main.dart` file. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

1. **Import the Package**: Import the injector package at the top of your `main.dart` file.

   ```dart
   import 'package:injector/injector.dart';
   ```

2. **Create a Service Class**: Define a service class that you want to inject. For example:

   ```dart
   class ApiService {
     String fetchData() {
       return "Data fetched from API";
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Register the Service**: In the `main` function, register your service with the injector.

   ```dart
   void main() {
     Injector.appInstance
       ..registerSingleton<ApiService>(ApiService());
     runApp(MyApp());
   }
   ```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure to enable the necessary permissions in your `Info.plist` if your application requires network access or other capabilities.

## Step 3: Using the Injector

To use the injected service in your widgets, you can retrieve it using:

```dart
final apiService = Injector.appInstance.get<ApiService>();
```

You can now use `apiService` to call its methods within your widget.

# Complete Example of Using the Injector Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:injector/injector.dart';

// Service class that we will inject
class ApiService {
  String fetchData() {
    return "Data fetched from API";
  }
}

// Main application class
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Injector Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

// Home screen widget
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Retrieve the ApiService instance from the injector
    final apiService = Injector.appInstance.get<ApiService>();

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Injector Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(apiService.fetchData()), // Display fetched data
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Main function to run the app
void main() {
  // Register the ApiService with the injector
  Injector.appInstance
    ..registerSingleton<ApiService>(ApiService());
  
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

/*
  Application Flow Explanation:
  1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
  2. We register the ApiService as a singleton in the injector.
  3. The RealFlutter class is the root widget of the application.
  4. The HomeScreen widget is displayed as the home screen.
  5. Inside HomeScreen, we retrieve the ApiService instance from the injector.
  6. We call the fetchData method of ApiService to get data and display it on the screen.
  7. This demonstrates how to use dependency injection to manage service instances in a Flutter app.

## Summary

In this blog, we explored the injector package for Flutter, detailing its purpose, features, and how to set it up in your application. We provided a complete example demonstrating how to register and use a service within a Flutter app. By leveraging dependency injection, you can create more maintainable and testable code, enhancing the overall architecture of your Flutter applications.
