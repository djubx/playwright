# Flutter Plot: A Comprehensive Overview

The **flutter_plot** package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to create dynamic and interactive plots and charts. This package is particularly useful for applications that require data visualization, such as analytics dashboards, scientific applications, or any app that needs to present data in a graphical format.

## When to Use flutter_plot
You should consider using the flutter_plot package when:
- You need to visualize complex datasets.
- You want to create interactive charts that respond to user input.
- You are developing applications in fields like finance, health, or education where data representation is crucial.

## Key Features
- **Multiple Chart Types**: Supports various chart types including line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, and more.
- **Customizable**: Offers extensive customization options for colors, labels, and styles.
- **Interactive**: Allows for user interactions such as zooming, panning, and tooltips.
- **Performance**: Optimized for performance, ensuring smooth rendering even with large datasets.

With these features, flutter_plot stands out as a versatile choice for developers looking to integrate data visualization into their Flutter applications.

# Setting Up and Using flutter_plot

## Installation
To get started with flutter_plot, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_plot: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_plot).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions or configurations in your `Info.plist` file, depending on your app's requirements. However, for basic usage of flutter_plot, no specific configurations are necessary.

## Basic Usage
Once you have installed the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a line chart:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_plot/flutter_plot.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Plot Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: LinePlot(
            data: [
              PlotData(x: 1, y: 2),
              PlotData(x: 2, y: 3),
              PlotData(x: 3, y: 5),
              PlotData(x: 4, y: 4),
            ],
            title: 'Sample Line Plot',
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() => runApp(RealFlutter());
```

In this example, we create a simple line plot with some sample data points. The `LinePlot` widget takes a list of `PlotData` objects, each representing a point on the chart.

With this setup, you are ready to start visualizing data in your Flutter applications using the flutter_plot package!

# Complete Example of flutter_plot

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_plot/flutter_plot.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Plot Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Creating a LinePlot widget to display a line chart
          child: LinePlot(
            // Providing a list of data points for the plot
            data: [
              PlotData(x: 1, y: 2), // Point 1
              PlotData(x: 2, y: 3), // Point 2
              PlotData(x: 3, y: 5), // Point 3
              PlotData(x: 4, y: 4), // Point 4
            ],
            title: 'Sample Line Plot', // Title of the plot
            xLabel: 'X Axis', // Label for the X-axis
            yLabel: 'Y Axis', // Label for the Y-axis
            // Customizing the appearance of the plot
            lineColor: Colors.blue,
            pointColor: Colors.red,
            pointSize: 5.0,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() => runApp(RealFlutter()); // Entry point of the application

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the Flutter application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the UI.
// 3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// 4. The AppBar displays the title of the application.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 6. A LinePlot widget is created to display a line chart with sample data points.
// 7. The data points are defined using the PlotData class, which takes x and y values.
// 8. The plot is customized with titles and colors for better visualization.
// 9. Finally, the application is run using the runApp function, which takes the RealFlutter widget.
