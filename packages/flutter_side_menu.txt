# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `flutter_side_menu`

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_side_menu` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_side_menu` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_side_menu: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Basic Setup

Next, we need to set up the main structure of our Flutter app. Create a new Dart file, for example, `main.dart`, and import the necessary packages:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_side_menu/flutter_side_menu.dart';
```

## Step 3: Implementing the Side Menu

Now, let's create a simple side menu using the `flutter_side_menu` package. Below is a basic implementation:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: SideMenu(
          menu: SideMenuItems(
            items: [
              SideMenuItem(
                icon: Icons.home,
                title: 'Home',
                onTap: () {
                  // Handle Home tap
                },
              ),
              SideMenuItem(
                icon: Icons.settings,
                title: 'Settings',
                onTap: () {
                  // Handle Settings tap
                },
              ),
            ],
          ),
          child: Center(child: Text('Main Content Area')),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Platform-Specific Details

- **Android**: Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions and configurations for your app.
- **iOS**: Update your `Info.plist` file if you are using any specific features that require permissions.

## Step 4: Customization and Optimization

You can customize the appearance of the side menu by modifying the `SideMenu` widget properties. For example, you can change the background color, text style, and animation duration to match your app's theme.

### Example Customization

```dart
SideMenu(
  backgroundColor: Colors.blueGrey,
  menu: SideMenuItems(
    items: [
      // Custom menu items
    ],
  ),
  child: Center(child: Text('Main Content Area')),
)
```

By following these steps, you can successfully integrate the `flutter_side_menu` package into your Flutter application, providing a robust navigation solution for your users.

# Complete Example of `flutter_side_menu`

Below is a complete example of a Flutter application using the `flutter_side_menu` package. This example demonstrates the key features of the package and includes detailed comments explaining the application flow.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_side_menu/flutter_side_menu.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Side Menu Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        // The main scaffold of the app
        body: SideMenu(
          // The SideMenu widget that wraps the main content
          menu: SideMenuItems(
            // Define the items in the side menu
            items: [
              SideMenuItem(
                icon: Icons.home,
                title: 'Home',
                onTap: () {
                  // Handle Home tap
                  print('Home tapped');
                },
              ),
              SideMenuItem(
                icon: Icons.settings,
                title: 'Settings',
                onTap: () {
                  // Handle Settings tap
                  print('Settings tapped');
                },
              ),
            ],
          ),
          child: Center(
            // Main content area
            child: Text(
              'Main Content Area',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home scaffold.
// 3. Inside the scaffold, the SideMenu widget is used to create a side navigation menu.
// 4. The SideMenuItems widget defines the items in the side menu, each with an icon and title.
// 5. Tapping on a menu item triggers the onTap callback, which can be used to navigate or perform actions.
// 6. The child of the SideMenu is the main content area, which displays the current screen or content.
```
