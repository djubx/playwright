- **Any App with Sensitive Data**: If your app handles personal or confidential information, this package can help maintain user privacy.

## Features

- **Control App Switcher Visibility**: Hide your app from the app switcher when it is in the background.
- **Platform-Specific Implementations**: Tailored functionality for both Android and iOS.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup and usage within your Flutter application.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Secure App Switcher

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **secure_app_switcher** package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **secure_app_switcher** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  secure_app_switcher: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/secure_app_switcher).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW"/>
```

3. Ensure that your app's `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to request permission for using the app switcher:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your Flutter application.

### Basic Usage

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:secure_app_switcher/secure_app_switcher.dart';
```

You can then use the following methods to control the app switcher behavior:

- **SecureAppSwitcher.hide()**: Hides the app from the app switcher.
- **SecureAppSwitcher.show()**: Shows the app in the app switcher.

### Example Implementation

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the **secure_app_switcher** package in your Flutter app:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:secure_app_switcher/secure_app_switcher.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Secure App Switcher Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Hide the app from the app switcher when the app starts
    SecureAppSwitcher.hide();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Show the app in the app switcher when the app is disposed
    SecureAppSwitcher.show();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Secure App Switcher Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('This app is hidden from the app switcher!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Secure App Switcher

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:secure_app_switcher/secure_app_switcher.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Secure App Switcher Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Hide the app from the app switcher when the app starts
    SecureAppSwitcher.hide();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Show the app in the app switcher when the app is disposed
    SecureAppSwitcher.show();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Secure App Switcher Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('This app is hidden from the app switcher!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets HomeScreen as the home widget.
// 3. HomeScreen is a StatefulWidget that manages its state.
// 4. In the initState() method, SecureAppSwitcher.hide() is called to hide the app from the app switcher when the app starts.
// 5. When the app is disposed (e.g., when the user navigates away), the dispose() method is called, which shows the app in the app switcher again using SecureAppSwitcher.show().
// 6. The build method returns a simple Scaffold with an AppBar and a centered text widget indicating that the app is hidden from the app switcher.
