# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_dismissible_tile

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_dismissible_tile` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_dismissible_tile: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_dismissible_tile/flutter_dismissible_tile.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

You can use the `DismissibleTile` widget to wrap around any widget you want to make dismissible. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
DismissibleTile(
  key: Key(item.id), // Unique key for each tile
  onDismissed: (direction) {
    // Handle the dismissal action
    if (direction == DismissDirection.startToEnd) {
      // Action for swipe right
    } else {
      // Action for swipe left
    }
  },
  child: ListTile(
    title: Text(item.title),
    subtitle: Text(item.subtitle),
  ),
);
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` to allow for swipe gestures if you encounter any issues. However, the default settings should work for most cases.

## Optimizations

- **Performance**: Use `ListView.builder` for large lists to improve performance.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure that dismiss actions are accessible to all users by providing appropriate labels and hints.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the `flutter_dismissible_tile` package effectively in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of flutter_dismissible_tile

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_dismissible_tile/flutter_dismissible_tile.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dismissible Tile Example',
      home: DismissibleTileDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class DismissibleTileDemo extends StatelessWidget {
  final List<String> items = List.generate(20, (index) => 'Item $index');

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Dismissible Tile Demo'),
      ),
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: items.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return DismissibleTile(
            key: Key(items[index]), // Unique key for each tile
            onDismissed: (direction) {
              // Remove the item from the data source
              items.removeAt(index);
              // Show a snackbar to confirm the action
              ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                SnackBar(content: Text('${items[index]} dismissed')),
              );
            },
            child: ListTile(
              title: Text(items[index]),
              subtitle: Text('Swipe to dismiss'),
            ),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget (DismissibleTileDemo).
// 3. DismissibleTileDemo creates a list of items to display.
// 4. A ListView.builder is used to create a scrollable list of DismissibleTile widgets.
// 5. Each DismissibleTile is given a unique key and an onDismissed callback to handle the dismissal action.
// 6. When a tile is dismissed, it is removed from the list, and a snackbar is shown to confirm the action.
```
