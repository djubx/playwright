# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_number_picker

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_number_picker` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_number_picker: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_number_picker/flutter_number_picker.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Number Picker

### Basic Usage

You can use the `NumberPicker` widget in your Flutter app as follows:

```dart
NumberPicker(
  value: 0, // Initial value
  minValue: 0, // Minimum value
  maxValue: 100, // Maximum value
  step: 1, // Step size
  onChanged: (value) {
    // Handle value change
  },
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

#### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Customizing the Number Picker

You can customize the appearance of the number picker by using various properties:

```dart
NumberPicker(
  value: 0,
  minValue: 0,
  maxValue: 100,
  step: 1,
  textStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.blue, fontSize: 24),
  selectedTextStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.red, fontSize: 30),
  onChanged: (value) {
    // Handle value change
  },
)
```

This customization allows you to change the text color and size for both selected and unselected values.

# Complete Example of flutter_number_picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_number_picker/flutter_number_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Number Picker Example',
      home: NumberPickerDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class NumberPickerDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _NumberPickerDemoState createState() => _NumberPickerDemoState();
}

class _NumberPickerDemoState extends State<NumberPickerDemo> {
  // Variable to hold the selected number
  int _selectedNumber = 0;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Number Picker Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display the currently selected number
            Text(
              'Selected Number: $_selectedNumber',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Number Picker widget
            NumberPicker(
              value: _selectedNumber, // Current value
              minValue: 0, // Minimum value
              maxValue: 100, // Maximum value
              step: 1, // Step size
              onChanged: (value) {
                // Update the state with the new value
                setState(() {
                  _selectedNumber = value; // Update selected number
                });
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp and its title.
// 3. The home of the MaterialApp is set to NumberPickerDemo, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 4. In the NumberPickerDemo state, we maintain a variable _selectedNumber to track the user's selection.
// 5. The build method constructs the UI, displaying the currently selected number and the NumberPicker widget.
// 6. When the user changes the number using the picker, the onChanged callback updates the _selectedNumber variable.
// 7. The UI is rebuilt to reflect the new selected number, providing a seamless user experience.
```
