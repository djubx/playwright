# Overview of the Pushpole Flutter Package

The **Pushpole** package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who want to implement push notifications in their applications. It simplifies the process of integrating push notifications across both Android and iOS platforms, allowing developers to focus on building their app's core features rather than getting bogged down in the complexities of notification handling.

## When to Use Pushpole
- **Real-time Updates**: If your application requires real-time updates, such as chat applications or live sports scores, Pushpole can help you deliver notifications instantly.
- **User Engagement**: For applications that rely on user engagement, such as e-commerce or social media apps, Pushpole can be used to send promotional notifications or alerts.
- **Event Reminders**: If your app includes events or deadlines, Pushpole can be utilized to remind users about these important dates.

## Key Features
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup process with minimal configuration required.
- **Custom Notification Handling**: Allows developers to customize how notifications are displayed and handled.
- **Rich Media Support**: Supports images, sounds, and other media types in notifications.
- **Analytics**: Provides insights into notification delivery and user engagement.

With these features, Pushpole stands out as a robust solution for managing push notifications in Flutter applications.

# Setting Up and Using Pushpole

## Installation
To get started with Pushpole, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  pushpole: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Add the necessary permissions and services in your `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED"/>
<application>
    <service android:name="com.pushpole.PushpoleService"/>
    <receiver android:name="com.pushpole.PushpoleReceiver"/>
</application>
```

2. **Firebase Setup**: If you are using Firebase for push notifications, ensure you have set up Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) and added the `google-services.json` file to your `android/app` directory.

### iOS
1. **Update Info.plist**: Add the following keys to your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>fetch</string>
    <string>remote-notification</string>
</array>
<key>FirebaseAppDelegateProxyEnabled</key>
<false/>
```

2. **Firebase Setup**: Similar to Android, ensure you have set up Firebase Cloud Messaging and added the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file to your `ios/Runner` directory.

## Basic Usage
Once you have completed the setup, you can start using Pushpole in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initialize and handle notifications:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pushpole/pushpole.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Pushpole Example',
      home: NotificationHome(),
    );
  }
}

class NotificationHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _NotificationHomeState createState() => _NotificationHomeState();
}

class _NotificationHomeState extends State<NotificationHome> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize Pushpole
    Pushpole.initialize();
    
    // Set up notification listener
    Pushpole.onMessage.listen((message) {
      // Handle incoming messages
      print("Received message: $message");
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Pushpole Notifications'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Listening for notifications...'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Pushpole in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pushpole/pushpole.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Pushpole Example',
      home: NotificationHome(),
    );
  }
}

class NotificationHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _NotificationHomeState createState() => _NotificationHomeState();
}

class _NotificationHomeState extends State<NotificationHome> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize Pushpole for handling notifications
    Pushpole.initialize();
    
    // Set up a listener for incoming messages
    Pushpole.onMessage.listen((message) {
      // Print the received message to the console
      print("Received message: $message");
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Pushpole Notifications'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Listening for notifications...'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets NotificationHome as the home widget.
// 3. NotificationHome is a StatefulWidget that initializes Pushpole in its initState method.
// 4. A listener is set up to handle incoming messages, which prints the message to the console.
// 5. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a centered text widget indicating that the app is listening for notifications.
