# Overview of the `shelf_cors_headers` Flutter Package

The `shelf_cors_headers` package is a middleware for Dart's Shelf web server that simplifies the implementation of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) headers. CORS is a security feature implemented by web browsers to prevent malicious websites from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page. This package is particularly useful when developing APIs that need to be accessed from different origins, such as mobile applications or web applications hosted on different domains.

## When to Use This Package
- When building a RESTful API that needs to be accessed from various client applications hosted on different domains.
- When you want to enable or restrict access to your API based on specific origins, methods, or headers.
- When you need a simple and effective way to manage CORS headers without manually configuring them for each request.

## Key Features
- **Easy Configuration**: Set up CORS headers with minimal code.
- **Flexible Options**: Customize allowed origins, methods, and headers.
- **Middleware Integration**: Easily integrate with existing Shelf applications.

# Setting Up and Using the `shelf_cors_headers` Package

## Installation
To use the `shelf_cors_headers` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  shelf: ^1.2.0
  shelf_cors_headers: ^0.2.0
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Details
The `shelf_cors_headers` package is primarily used in server-side Dart applications. Therefore, there are no specific configurations required for Android or iOS platforms. However, ensure that your Dart environment is set up correctly to run a Shelf server.

## Basic Usage
To use the `shelf_cors_headers` package, you need to create a Shelf server and apply the CORS middleware. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set it up:

```dart
import 'dart:io';
import 'package:shelf/shelf.dart';
import 'package:shelf/shelf.dart';
import 'package:shelf_cors_headers/shelf_cors_headers.dart';

void main() async {
  // Create a handler that responds to requests
  var handler = const Pipeline()
      .addMiddleware(corsHeaders()) // Add CORS middleware
      .addHandler(_echoRequest); // Add request handler

  // Start the server
  var server = await HttpServer.bind(InternetAddress.anyIPv4, 8080);
  print('Serving at http://${server.address.host}:${server.port}');
  await serveRequests(server, handler);
}

// Function to handle incoming requests
Response _echoRequest(Request request) {
  return Response.ok('Request for "${request.url}" received.');
}
```

In this example:
- We create a simple HTTP server that listens on port 8080.
- The `corsHeaders()` middleware is added to the request pipeline to handle CORS.
- The `_echoRequest` function responds to incoming requests.

# Complete Example of Using `shelf_cors_headers`

```dart
import 'dart:io';
import 'package:shelf/shelf.dart';
import 'package:shelf/shelf.dart';
import 'package:shelf_cors_headers/shelf_cors_headers.dart';

void main() async {
  // Create a handler that responds to requests
  var handler = const Pipeline()
      .addMiddleware(corsHeaders()) // Add CORS middleware
      .addHandler(_echoRequest); // Add request handler

  // Start the server
  var server = await HttpServer.bind(InternetAddress.anyIPv4, 8080);
  print('Serving at http://${server.address.host}:${server.port}');
  await serveRequests(server, handler);
}

// Function to handle incoming requests
Response _echoRequest(Request request) {
  return Response.ok('Request for "${request.url}" received.');
}

// The following comments explain the flow of the application:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. We create a handler using the Pipeline class from the shelf package.
// 3. The corsHeaders() middleware is added to the pipeline to handle CORS.
// 4. The _echoRequest function is defined to handle incoming requests and respond with a message.
// 5. The server is started on port 8080, and a message is printed to the console indicating the server's address.
// 6. The serveRequests function is called to start listening for incoming requests.
// 7. When a request is received, the _echoRequest function is invoked, which returns a response containing the request URL.

### Summary
In this blog post, we explored the `shelf_cors_headers` package, which provides an easy way to manage CORS headers in Dart's Shelf web server applications. We covered the installation process, basic usage, and provided a complete example demonstrating how to set up a simple server with CORS support. This package is particularly useful for developers building APIs that need to be accessed from various origins, ensuring a smooth and secure interaction between clients and servers.
