# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Awesome Circular Chart

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started with the **awesome_circular_chart** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  awesome_circular_chart: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package
In your Dart file where you want to use the circular chart, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:awesome_circular_chart/awesome_circular_chart.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Circular Chart
You can now use the `AwesomeCircularChart` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
AwesomeCircularChart(
  size: const Size(300.0, 300.0),
  initialChartData: [
    CircularStackEntry(
      [
        CircularSegmentEntry(40.0, Colors.blue, rankKey: 'Q1'),
        CircularSegmentEntry(30.0, Colors.red, rankKey: 'Q2'),
        CircularSegmentEntry(20.0, Colors.green, rankKey: 'Q3'),
        CircularSegmentEntry(10.0, Colors.yellow, rankKey: 'Q4'),
      ],
      rankKey: 'Quarterly Sales',
    ),
  ],
)
```

This code creates a circular chart representing quarterly sales data with different colors for each segment.

# Complete Example of Awesome Circular Chart

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:awesome_circular_chart/awesome_circular_chart.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Awesome Circular Chart Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Circular Chart Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: AwesomeCircularChart(
            size: const Size(300.0, 300.0), // Set the size of the chart
            initialChartData: [
              CircularStackEntry(
                [
                  CircularSegmentEntry(40.0, Colors.blue, rankKey: 'Q1'), // Segment for Q1
                  CircularSegmentEntry(30.0, Colors.red, rankKey: 'Q2'), // Segment for Q2
                  CircularSegmentEntry(20.0, Colors.green, rankKey: 'Q3'), // Segment for Q3
                  CircularSegmentEntry(10.0, Colors.yellow, rankKey: 'Q4'), // Segment for Q4
                ],
                rankKey: 'Quarterly Sales', // Key for the stack entry
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Circular Chart Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains the AwesomeCircularChart widget.
// 5. The AwesomeCircularChart is configured with a size of 300x300 pixels and initial data representing quarterly sales.
// 6. Each segment of the chart is defined with a value and a color, making it visually distinct.
// 7. The app displays a circular chart that represents the sales data for four quarters, providing a clear visual representation of the data.
