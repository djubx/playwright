void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Create an iCalendar object
  ICalendar _iCalendar = ICalendar();

  // Add an event to the iCalendar object
  void _addEvent() {
    // Create an event object
    Event _event = Event(
      uid: 'event1',
      start: DateTime.now(),
      end: DateTime.now().add(Duration(hours: 1)),
      summary: 'Test Event',
    );

    // Add the event to the iCalendar object
    _iCalendar.add(_event);
  }

  // Remove an event from the iCalendar object
  void _removeEvent() {
    // Remove the event with the specified UID
    _iCalendar.remove('event1');
  }

  // Generate an iCalendar file
  void _generateICalendarFile() {
    // Generate the iCalendar file
    String _iCalendarFile = _iCalendar.toICalendar();

    // Print the iCalendar file
    print(_iCalendarFile);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('RealFlutter'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _addEvent,
                child: Text('Add Event'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _removeEvent,
                child: Text('Remove Event'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _generateICalendarFile,
                child: Text('Generate iCalendar File'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a screen containing three buttons: "Add Event", "Remove Event", and "Generate iCalendar File".
// 2. When the user clicks the "Add Event" button, an event is created and added to the iCalendar object.
// 3. When the user clicks the "Remove Event" button, the event with the specified UID is removed from the iCalendar object.
// 4. When the user clicks the "Generate iCalendar File" button, the iCalendar object is converted to an iCalendar file and printed to the console.
// 5. The user can repeat steps 2-4 as needed to manipulate the iCalendar object and generate iCalendar files.

// In summary, this app demonstrates how to create an iCalendar object, add and remove events, and generate an iCalendar file using the enough_icalendar package.
