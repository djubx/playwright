# Tutorial: Setting Up the Touch Indicator Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To use the **touch_indicator** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  touch_indicator: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install the Package
Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file if your app requires specific touch functionalities. However, for basic usage, no additional configuration is typically required.

## Step 4: Import the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:touch_indicator/touch_indicator.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Touch Indicator
You can now use the **TouchIndicator** widget in your application. Wrap any widget you want to provide touch feedback for with the `TouchIndicator` widget.

```dart
TouchIndicator(
  child: YourWidget(),
  onTap: () {
    // Handle tap event
  },
);
```

This setup will allow you to see visual feedback whenever the user taps on the wrapped widget.

# Complete Example of Using Touch Indicator

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:touch_indicator/touch_indicator.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Touch Indicator Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Touch Indicator Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: TouchIndicator(
            // Wrapping a button with TouchIndicator
            child: ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action to perform on button press
                print('Button Pressed!');
              },
              child: Text('Press Me'),
            ),
            onTap: () {
              // This will be called when the button is tapped
              print('Touch Indicator Activated!');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Touch Indicator Demo'.
// 4. In the body of the Scaffold, a Center widget is used to center the content.
// 5. The TouchIndicator wraps an ElevatedButton, providing touch feedback.
// 6. When the button is pressed, it prints 'Button Pressed!' to the console.
// 7. The onTap callback of TouchIndicator prints 'Touch Indicator Activated!' when the button is tapped, demonstrating the touch feedback.
