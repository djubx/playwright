# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Email Sender Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, you need to add the **email_sender** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  email_sender: ^6.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to attach images.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to take pictures for attachments.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio attachments.</string>
```

## Step 3: Import the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:email_sender/email_sender.dart';
```

## Step 4: Sending an Email
You can now use the package to send an email. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
void sendEmail() async {
  final Email email = Email(
    body: 'Hello, this is a test email.',
    subject: 'Test Email',
    recipients: ['example@example.com'],
    isHTML: false,
  );

  try {
    await EmailSender.send(email);
    print('Email sent successfully!');
  } catch (error) {
    print('Error sending email: $error');
  }
}
```

This function creates an email object and sends it using the `EmailSender.send()` method. Make sure to handle exceptions to catch any errors during the sending process.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the **email_sender** package into your Flutter application successfully.

# Complete Example of Using the Email Sender Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:email_sender/email_sender.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Email Sender Example',
      home: EmailSenderPage(),
    );
  }
}

class EmailSenderPage extends StatelessWidget {
  // Function to send an email
  void sendEmail() async {
    // Create an Email object with the required parameters
    final Email email = Email(
      body: 'Hello, this is a test email.',
      subject: 'Test Email',
      recipients: ['example@example.com'], // Replace with your recipient
      isHTML: false, // Set to true if the body is HTML
    );

    try {
      // Attempt to send the email
      await EmailSender.send(email);
      // Print success message
      print('Email sent successfully!');
    } catch (error) {
      // Print error message if sending fails
      print('Error sending email: $error');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Email Sender Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: sendEmail, // Call sendEmail when button is pressed
          child: Text('Send Email'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app and sets MyApp as the home widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets EmailSenderPage as the home page.
// 3. EmailSenderPage contains a button that, when pressed, triggers the sendEmail function.
// 4. The sendEmail function creates an Email object with the specified body, subject, and recipient.
// 5. It attempts to send the email using EmailSender.send() and handles any errors that may occur.
// 6. If the email is sent successfully, a success message is printed; otherwise, an error message is displayed.
```
