# Tutorial: Setting Up the Referrer Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the referrer package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the referrer package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  referrer: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

2. **Enable Google Play Services**: Ensure that your app is configured to use Google Play Services, as the referrer package relies on it for tracking.

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. **Enable Associated Domains**: If you are using Universal Links, make sure to enable Associated Domains in your Xcode project settings.

## Step 3: Using the Referrer Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your application.

### Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the referrer package:

```dart
import 'package:referrer/referrer.dart';
```

### Fetching Referral Data

You can fetch the referral data using the following code snippet:

```dart
void fetchReferrerData() async {
  final referrer = Referrer();
  String? referrerData = await referrer.getReferrer();
  print('Referrer Data: $referrerData');
}
```

This function initializes the referrer instance and retrieves the referral data, which can then be used for analytics or tracking purposes.

# Complete Example of Using the Referrer Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:referrer/referrer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Referrer Example',
      home: ReferrerHome(),
    );
  }
}

class ReferrerHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ReferrerHomeState createState() => _ReferrerHomeState();
}

class _ReferrerHomeState extends State<ReferrerHome> {
  String _referrerData = 'No referrer data yet';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Fetch the referrer data when the app starts
    fetchReferrerData();
  }

  void fetchReferrerData() async {
    final referrer = Referrer();
    // Get the referrer data asynchronously
    String? referrerData = await referrer.getReferrer();
    // Update the state with the fetched referrer data
    setState(() {
      _referrerData = referrerData ?? 'Failed to get referrer data';
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Referrer Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          _referrerData, // Display the referrer data
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and home set to ReferrerHome.
// 3. ReferrerHome is a StatefulWidget that initializes its state in initState.
// 4. In initState, fetchReferrerData is called to retrieve the referrer data.
// 5. fetchReferrerData creates an instance of Referrer and calls getReferrer.
// 6. The fetched referrer data is stored in the _referrerData variable.
// 7. The UI is updated using setState, which triggers a rebuild of the widget.
// 8. The referrer data is displayed in the center of the screen.
```
