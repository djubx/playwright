# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the `menu_bar` Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `menu_bar` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  menu_bar: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the current version of the package.

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### For Android

Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions and configurations. You may need to adjust the theme or styles to accommodate the menu bar.

### For iOS

In your `Info.plist`, you might want to add any specific configurations required for your app's functionality, especially if you are using features that require permissions.

## Step 4: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a menu bar:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:menu_bar/menu_bar.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Menu Bar Example')),
        body: Center(child: Text('Welcome to RealFlutter!')),
        // Add the menu bar here
        bottomNavigationBar: MenuBar(
          items: [
            MenuItem(label: 'File', submenu: [
              MenuItem(label: 'New', onClick: () => print('New File')),
              MenuItem(label: 'Open', onClick: () => print('Open File')),
            ]),
            MenuItem(label: 'Edit', submenu: [
              MenuItem(label: 'Undo', onClick: () => print('Undo')),
              MenuItem(label: 'Redo', onClick: () => print('Redo')),
            ]),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic menu bar with "File" and "Edit" options, each containing submenus.

## Step 5: Running Your Application

Finally, run your application using:

```bash
flutter run
```

You should see the menu bar at the bottom of your application, allowing you to interact with the menu items.

With these steps, you have successfully integrated the `menu_bar` package into your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Using the `menu_bar` Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:menu_bar/menu_bar.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Menu Bar Example')),
        body: Center(child: Text('Welcome to RealFlutter!')),
        // Adding the menu bar at the bottom of the screen
        bottomNavigationBar: MenuBar(
          items: [
            // Main menu item "File" with a submenu
            MenuItem(label: 'File', submenu: [
              MenuItem(label: 'New', onClick: () => print('New File')),
              MenuItem(label: 'Open', onClick: () => print('Open File')),
            ]),
            // Main menu item "Edit" with a submenu
            MenuItem(label: 'Edit', submenu: [
              MenuItem(label: 'Undo', onClick: () => print('Undo')),
              MenuItem(label: 'Redo', onClick: () => print('Redo')),
            ]),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The AppBar displays the title "Menu Bar Example" at the top of the screen.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a centered text widget that welcomes users to RealFlutter.
// 5. The bottomNavigationBar property of the Scaffold is set to a MenuBar widget.
// 6. The MenuBar contains two main menu items: "File" and "Edit", each with their respective submenus.
// 7. When a user clicks on a menu item, the corresponding action is printed to the console (e.g., "New File", "Open File", etc.).
// 8. This structure allows for easy navigation and interaction within the application, enhancing the user experience.
