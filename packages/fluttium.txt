# Fluttium Setup and Usage Tutorial

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the Fluttium package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding Fluttium to Your Project

To get started, you need to add Fluttium to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  fluttium: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # Ensure this is set to at least 10.0
```

## Step 3: Using Fluttium in Your Application

Now that you have set up Fluttium, you can start using it in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement state management and API calls using the `RealFlutter` class.

1. Import the Fluttium package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:fluttium/fluttium.dart';
```

2. Create a new class that extends `RealFlutter` to manage your application state and API calls.

```dart
class MyApp extends RealFlutter {
  // Your application logic here
}
```

3. Implement the necessary methods to handle state and API interactions.

With these steps, you are now ready to leverage the power of Fluttium in your Flutter applications!

# Complete Example of Fluttium in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fluttium/fluttium.dart';

// The main entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// MyApp class extending RealFlutter to utilize Fluttium features
class MyApp extends RealFlutter {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Fluttium Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

// HomePage widget to demonstrate Fluttium functionalities
class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Fluttium Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Trigger an API call when the button is pressed
            fetchData();
          },
          child: Text('Fetch Data'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to fetch data using Fluttium's API utilities
  void fetchData() async {
    // Using Fluttium's built-in method to make an API call
    final response = await RealFlutter.api.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
    
    // Check if the response is successful
    if (response.statusCode == 200) {
      // Parse the response data
      final data = response.data;
      // Display the data in a dialog
      showDialog(
        context: context,
        builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
          title: Text('Fetched Data'),
          content: Text(data.toString()), // Display the fetched data
          actions: [
            TextButton(
              onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
              child: Text('Close'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      );
    } else {
      // Handle error response
      print('Failed to fetch data: ${response.statusCode}');
    }
  }
}

// Application flow explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which runs MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds the MaterialApp and sets HomePage as the home widget.
// 3. HomePage displays a button that, when pressed, triggers the fetchData() function.
// 4. fetchData() makes an API call to fetch data from a placeholder API.
// 5. If the response is successful, it displays the data in an AlertDialog.
// 6. If the response fails, it prints an error message to the console.
```
