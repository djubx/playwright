# Setting Up and Using the photo_album_manager Package

## Installation
To get started with the `photo_album_manager` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  photo_album_manager: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/photo_album_manager).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request permission to access the photo library:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to manage albums.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need permission to add photos to your albums.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
Once you have installed the package and configured the necessary permissions, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create an album and add photos to it.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:photo_album_manager/photo_album_manager.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Initialize the album manager
  final PhotoAlbumManager _albumManager = PhotoAlbumManager();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Fetch albums when the app starts
    _fetchAlbums();
  }

  void _fetchAlbums() async {
    // Retrieve the list of albums
    List<Album> albums = await _albumManager.getAlbums();
    // Handle the albums as needed
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Photo Album Manager')),
        body: Center(child: Text('Manage your photo albums here!')),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code initializes the `photo_album_manager`, fetches the albums on startup, and sets up a basic UI.

# Complete Example of Using photo_album_manager

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:photo_album_manager/photo_album_manager.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Initialize the album manager
  final PhotoAlbumManager _albumManager = PhotoAlbumManager();
  List<Album> _albums = []; // List to hold fetched albums

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Fetch albums when the app starts
    _fetchAlbums();
  }

  // Function to fetch albums from the device
  void _fetchAlbums() async {
    // Retrieve the list of albums
    List<Album> albums = await _albumManager.getAlbums();
    setState(() {
      _albums = albums; // Update the state with fetched albums
    });
  }

  // Function to create a new album
  void _createAlbum(String albumName) async {
    await _albumManager.createAlbum(albumName);
    _fetchAlbums(); // Refresh the album list after creation
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Photo Album Manager')),
        body: Column(
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () => _createAlbum('New Album'), // Create a new album
              child: Text('Create Album'),
            ),
            Expanded(
              child: ListView.builder(
                itemCount: _albums.length,
                itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                  return ListTile(
                    title: Text(_albums[index].name), // Display album name
                  );
                },
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and initializes the PhotoAlbumManager.
// 2. In the initState method, it calls _fetchAlbums to retrieve existing albums.
// 3. The albums are stored in the _albums list and displayed in a ListView.
// 4. The user can create a new album by pressing the "Create Album" button, which calls _createAlbum.
// 5. After creating an album, the app refreshes the album list to show the newly created album.
