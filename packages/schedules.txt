# Overview of the Schedules Flutter Package

The **schedules** Flutter package is designed to help developers manage and display schedules in their applications. It provides a simple and efficient way to create, modify, and visualize schedules, making it ideal for applications that require time management features, such as calendars, task managers, or event planners.

## When to Use This Package
You might consider using the **schedules** package in scenarios such as:
- Building a calendar application that displays events and appointments.
- Creating a task management tool that allows users to schedule tasks.
- Developing an educational app that includes class schedules or timetables.

## Key Features
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Create schedules with various time intervals and formats.
- **Customizable UI**: Easily customize the appearance of the schedule to fit your app's design.
- **Event Management**: Add, edit, and delete events within the schedule.
- **Notifications**: Set up reminders for scheduled events.

The **schedules** package is a powerful tool for any Flutter developer looking to implement scheduling features in their applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Schedules Package

## Installation
To get started with the **schedules** package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  schedules: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` to allow notifications if you plan to use the notification feature. Add the following keys:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>fetch</string>
    <string>remote-notification</string>
</array>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the **schedules** package, you can start by importing it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:schedules/schedules.dart';
```

You can then create a simple schedule and display it in your app. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to set up a schedule:

```dart
// Create a new schedule
final schedule = Schedule();

// Add an event to the schedule
schedule.addEvent(Event(
  title: 'Meeting',
  startTime: DateTime.now(),
  endTime: DateTime.now().add(Duration(hours: 1)),
));

// Display the schedule
schedule.display();
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to create a new schedule, add an event, and display it. You can further customize the schedule and events as per your requirements.

# Complete Example of Using the Schedules Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:schedules/schedules.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Schedules Example',
      home: SchedulePage(),
    );
  }
}

class SchedulePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SchedulePageState createState() => _SchedulePageState();
}

class _SchedulePageState extends State<SchedulePage> {
  // Create a new schedule instance
  final Schedule schedule = Schedule();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Add sample events to the schedule
    schedule.addEvent(Event(
      title: 'Team Meeting',
      startTime: DateTime.now(),
      endTime: DateTime.now().add(Duration(hours: 1)),
    ));
    schedule.addEvent(Event(
      title: 'Project Deadline',
      startTime: DateTime.now().add(Duration(days: 1)),
      endTime: DateTime.now().add(Duration(days: 1, hours: 2)),
    ));
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('My Schedule'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Display the schedule
          Expanded(
            child: ScheduleView(schedule: schedule),
          ),
          // Button to add a new event
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Logic to add a new event can be implemented here
            },
            child: Text('Add Event'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home page (SchedulePage).
// 3. SchedulePage initializes a Schedule instance and adds sample events in initState.
// 4. The build method of SchedulePage creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 5. The body contains a ScheduleView widget that displays the current schedule.
// 6. An ElevatedButton is provided to allow users to add new events (logic to be implemented).
// 7. The ScheduleView widget is responsible for rendering the schedule visually.
```
