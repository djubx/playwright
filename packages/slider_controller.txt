# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Slider Controller

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the **slider_controller** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  slider_controller: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:slider_controller/slider_controller.dart';
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` if your slider interacts with system settings (like volume). However, for basic usage, no additional configuration is required.

## Step 4: Using the Slider Controller
You can now use the `SliderController` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:slider_controller/slider_controller.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Slider Controller Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: SliderController(
            min: 0,
            max: 100,
            initialValue: 50,
            onChanged: (value) {
              // Handle value change
              print('Slider value: $value');
            },
            activeColor: Colors.blue,
            inactiveColor: Colors.grey,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application with a slider that ranges from 0 to 100, starting at 50. The `onChanged` callback prints the current value of the slider whenever it is adjusted.

# Complete Example of Slider Controller

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:slider_controller/slider_controller.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Slider Controller Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: SliderController(
            min: 0, // Minimum value of the slider
            max: 100, // Maximum value of the slider
            initialValue: 50, // Starting value of the slider
            onChanged: (value) {
              // This callback is triggered when the slider value changes
              print('Slider value: $value'); // Print the current value to the console
            },
            activeColor: Colors.blue, // Color of the slider when active
            inactiveColor: Colors.grey, // Color of the slider when inactive
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the application
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the Flutter application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a centered SliderController.
// 3. The SliderController is configured with a range from 0 to 100, starting at 50.
// 4. When the user interacts with the slider, the onChanged callback is triggered, printing the current slider value to the console.
// 5. The active and inactive colors of the slider are set to blue and grey, respectively, enhancing the visual feedback for the user.
```
