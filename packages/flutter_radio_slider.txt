# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_radio_slider

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `flutter_radio_slider` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_radio_slider: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `flutter_radio_slider` in your app.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_radio_slider/flutter_radio_slider.dart';
```

2. Create a stateful widget to manage the slider's state:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  double _sliderValue = 0.0; // Initial value for the slider

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Radio Slider Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Selected Value: ${_sliderValue.toStringAsFixed(1)}'),
            RadioSlider(
              min: 0.0,
              max: 10.0,
              divisions: 10,
              value: _sliderValue,
              onChanged: (value) {
                setState(() {
                  _sliderValue = value; // Update the slider value
                });
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Run your application to see the slider in action.

# Complete Example of flutter_radio_slider

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_radio_slider/flutter_radio_slider.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Radio Slider Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(), // Set the home to our main widget
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  double _sliderValue = 0.0; // Initial value for the slider

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Radio Slider Example'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the currently selected value
            Text('Selected Value: ${_sliderValue.toStringAsFixed(1)}'),
            // Create the RadioSlider widget
            RadioSlider(
              min: 0.0, // Minimum value of the slider
              max: 10.0, // Maximum value of the slider
              divisions: 10, // Number of discrete divisions
              value: _sliderValue, // Current value of the slider
              onChanged: (value) {
                setState(() {
                  _sliderValue = value; // Update the slider value
                });
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home widget as RealFlutter.
// 3. RealFlutter is a stateful widget that maintains the state of the slider.
// 4. The slider's initial value is set to 0.0.
// 5. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 6. Inside the Center widget, a Column displays the selected value and the RadioSlider.
// 7. When the slider is moved, the onChanged callback updates the _sliderValue state.
// 8. The UI rebuilds to reflect the new selected value.
