```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  widget_video_recorder: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/widget_video_recorder).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

2. Add the following keys to request permissions:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the camera to record videos.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the microphone to record audio.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to save videos to your photo library.</string>
```

## Using the Package
To use the `widget_video_recorder`, you can create a simple UI that allows users to start and stop video recording. Below is a basic example of how to implement this.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:widget_video_recorder/widget_video_recorder.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late WidgetVideoRecorderController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _controller = WidgetVideoRecorderController();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  void _startRecording() async {
    await _controller.startVideoRecording();
  }

  void _stopRecording() async {
    final videoFile = await _controller.stopVideoRecording();
    // Handle the recorded video file (e.g., save or upload)
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Video Recorder')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _startRecording,
              child: Text('Start Recording'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _stopRecording,
              child: Text('Stop Recording'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic video recording interface with two buttons: one to start recording and another to stop recording. The recorded video can then be handled as needed (e.g., saved or uploaded).

# Complete Example of `widget_video_recorder`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:widget_video_recorder/widget_video_recorder.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late WidgetVideoRecorderController _controller; // Controller for video recording

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _controller = WidgetVideoRecorderController(); // Initialize the controller
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _controller.dispose(); // Dispose of the controller when not needed
    super.dispose();
  }

  void _startRecording() async {
    await _controller.startVideoRecording(); // Start video recording
  }

  void _stopRecording() async {
    final videoFile = await _controller.stopVideoRecording(); // Stop recording and get the video file
    // Handle the recorded video file (e.g., save or upload)
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Video Recorder')), // App bar with title
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _startRecording, // Start recording on button press
              child: Text('Start Recording'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _stopRecording, // Stop recording on button press
              child: Text('Stop Recording'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the `RealFlutter` widget, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 2. In the `initState` method, we initialize the `WidgetVideoRecorderController`.
// 3. The UI consists of two buttons: "Start Recording" and "Stop Recording".
// 4. When the "Start Recording" button is pressed, the `_startRecording` method is called, which starts the video recording.
// 5. When the "Stop Recording" button is pressed, the `_stopRecording` method is called, which stops the recording and retrieves the recorded video file.
// 6. The recorded video can then be processed as needed (e.g., saved to the device or uploaded to a server).
// 7. The controller is disposed of in the `dispose` method to free up resources when the widget is removed from the widget tree.
