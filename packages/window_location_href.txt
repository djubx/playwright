Here's a detailed technical blog on the "window_location_href" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Overview of the `window_location_href` Flutter Package

The `window_location_href` package is a Flutter plugin that provides a simple way to interact with the browser's location object, specifically the `window.location.href` property. This package is particularly useful for Flutter web applications where you need to manipulate the URL or respond to changes in the URL.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the `window_location_href` package in scenarios such as:

- **Single Page Applications (SPAs)**: When building SPAs, you often need to change the URL without reloading the page. This package allows you to update the URL dynamically.
- **Deep Linking**: If your application supports deep linking, you can use this package to navigate to specific parts of your app based on the URL.
- **Tracking Navigation**: For analytics purposes, you may want to track user navigation through different URLs in your web app.

## Features

- **Get Current URL**: Easily retrieve the current URL of the web page.
- **Set New URL**: Change the URL in the browser without reloading the page.
- **Listen for URL Changes**: React to changes in the URL, allowing for dynamic content updates.

Overall, the `window_location_href` package is a powerful tool for Flutter web developers looking to enhance their applications' navigation capabilities.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `window_location_href`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `window_location_href` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  window_location_href: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/window_location_href).

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:window_location_href/window_location_href.dart';
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### For Web

No additional configuration is required for web applications. Just ensure that your Flutter project is set up for web development.

### For Android and iOS

While this package is primarily designed for web applications, if you are using Flutter for mobile, you may want to ensure that your app can handle deep links. This typically involves configuring your Android and iOS projects to recognize specific URL schemes.

- **Android**: Update your `AndroidManifest.xml` to include intent filters for deep linking.
- **iOS**: Update your `Info.plist` to handle URL schemes.

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the package to get and set the URL. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use it:

```dart
void main() {
  // Get the current URL
  String currentUrl = windowLocationHref.get();
  print('Current URL: $currentUrl');

  // Set a new URL
  windowLocationHref.set('https://example.com/new-page');
}
```

This code retrieves the current URL and sets a new URL, demonstrating the basic functionality of the package.

# Complete Example of Using `window_location_href`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:window_location_href/window_location_href.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Window Location Href Example',
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomePageState createState() => _HomePageState();
}

class _HomePageState extends State<HomePage> {
  String currentUrl = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Get the current URL when the app starts
    currentUrl = windowLocationHref.get();
  }

  void _changeUrl() {
    // Change the URL when the button is pressed
    windowLocationHref.set('https://example.com/new-page');
    // Update the current URL state
    setState(() {
      currentUrl = windowLocationHref.get();
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Window Location Href Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Current URL: $currentUrl'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _changeUrl,
              child: Text('Change URL'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home page.
// 3. The HomePage widget initializes its state by getting the current URL using windowLocationHref.get().
// 4. When the user presses the "Change URL" button, the _changeUrl method is called.
// 5. This method sets a new URL using windowLocationHref.set() and updates the currentUrl state.
// 6. The UI is rebuilt to display the updated URL.
```
