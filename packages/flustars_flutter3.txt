    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

# Complete Example of Flustars Flutter3

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flustars_flutter3/flustars_flutter3.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flustars Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flustars Flutter3 Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: DateDisplay(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DateDisplay extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Get the current date and format it
    String formattedDate = DateUtil.formatDate(DateTime.now(), format: 'yyyy-MM-dd');
    
    // Display the formatted date in a Text widget
    return Text(
      'Current Date: $formattedDate',
      style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds the DateDisplay widget.
// 4. The DateDisplay widget formats the current date using the DateUtil class from flustars_flutter3.
// 5. The formatted date is displayed in a Text widget, which is centered on the screen.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application that utilizes the **flustars_flutter3** package to display the current date. The application flow is straightforward, starting from the `main` function, which initializes the app, to the `DateDisplay` widget that formats and shows the date. This demonstrates how easily you can integrate the package into your Flutter projects to enhance functionality.
