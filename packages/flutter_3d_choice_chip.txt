          title: Text('3D Choice Chip Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ChoiceChipDemo(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class ChoiceChipDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ChoiceChipDemoState createState() => _ChoiceChipDemoState();
}

class _ChoiceChipDemoState extends State<ChoiceChipDemo> {
  // Variable to hold the selected chip value
  String selectedChip = 'Option 1';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        // Display the selected chip value
        Text(
          'Selected: $selectedChip',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20),
        // Create a row of 3D choice chips
        Row(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // First choice chip
            3DChoiceChip(
              value: 'Option 1',
              onSelected: (selected) {
                // Update the selected chip value
                setState(() {
                  selectedChip = 'Option 1';
                });

              color: Colors.blue,
              selectedColor: Colors.blueAccent,
            ),
            SizedBox(width: 10),
            // Second choice chip
            3DChoiceChip(
              value: 'Option 2',
              onSelected: (selected) {
                // Update the selected chip value
                setState(() {
                  selectedChip = 'Option 2';
                });

              // Customize the appearance
              color: Colors.green,
              selectedColor: Colors.greenAccent,
            ),
            SizedBox(width: 10),
            // Third choice chip
            3DChoiceChip(
              value: 'Option 3',
              onSelected: (selected) {
                // Update the selected chip value
                setState(() {
                  selectedChip = 'Option 3';
                });
              },
              // Customize the appearance
              color: Colors.red,

            ),
          ],
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter class builds the MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds the ChoiceChipDemo.
// 4. The ChoiceChipDemo is a StatefulWidget that maintains the selected chip state.
// 5. The build method displays the currently selected chip and a row of 3D choice chips.
// 6. Each chip updates the selectedChip state when tapped, causing the UI to refresh and display the new selection.
