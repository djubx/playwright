# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using cr_file_saver

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `cr_file_saver` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cr_file_saver: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/cr_file_saver).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, you need to ensure that you have the necessary permissions to write to external storage. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to add a usage description for saving files. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following key:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to the photo library to save files.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to use the `cr_file_saver` package to save a text file.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cr_file_saver/cr_file_saver.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('File Saver Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Define the content and file name
              String content = "Hello, this is a test file!";
              String fileName = "test_file.txt";

              // Save the file using cr_file_saver
              await CrFileSaver.saveFile(content, fileName);
            },
            child: Text('Save File'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, a text file named `test_file.txt` containing the specified content will be saved to the device.

# Complete Example of cr_file_saver

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cr_file_saver/cr_file_saver.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('File Saver Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Define the content to be saved in the file
              String content = "Hello, this is a test file!";
              // Specify the name of the file to be saved
              String fileName = "test_file.txt";

              // Call the saveFile method from cr_file_saver to save the file
              await CrFileSaver.saveFile(content, fileName);
            },
            child: Text('Save File'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and displays a button labeled 'Save File'.
// 2. When the user taps the button, the onPressed callback is triggered.
// 3. Inside the callback, we define the content of the file and the desired file name.
// 4. The saveFile method from the cr_file_saver package is called with the content and file name as arguments.
// 5. The file is saved to the device's storage, and the user can access it later.
```
