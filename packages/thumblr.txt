# Setting Up and Using Thumblr
=============================

### Step 1: Add Thumblr to Your Project

To use Thumblr in your Flutter project, add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import Thumblr

Import the Thumblr package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:thumblr/thumblr.dart';
```

### Step 3: Create a Thumblr Instance

Create a new instance of the Thumblr class:

```dart
Thumblr thumblr = Thumblr();
```

### Step 4: Configure Thumblr

Configure Thumblr to suit your needs. For example, you can set the layout and design:

```dart
thumblr.setLayout(LayoutType.grid);
thumblr.setDesign(DesignType.material);
```

### Platform-Specific Details

Thumblr supports both Android and iOS platforms. However, some features may require platform-specific configurations or optimizations.

    ```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```
*   iOS: To use Thumblr on iOS, you need to add the following configuration to your `Info.plist` file:

    ```xml

<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:thumblr/thumblr.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Thumblr Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  Thumblr thumblr = Thumblr();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    thumblr.setLayout(LayoutType.grid);
    thumblr.setDesign(DesignType.material);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Thumblr Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ThumblrWidget(thumblr: thumblr),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app, and the MyApp widget is created.
// 2. The MyApp widget builds the MyHomePage widget.
// 3. The MyHomePage widget creates a new instance of the Thumblr class.
// 4. The Thumblr instance is configured to use a grid layout and material design.
// 5. The ThumblrWidget is created, passing the Thumblr instance as a parameter.
// 6. The ThumblrWidget is displayed in the center of the screen.
// 7. The user can interact with the ThumblrWidget, such as scrolling and tapping on items.

// In summary, the code flows as follows:
// MyApp -> MyHomePage -> Thumblr -> ThumblrWidget
