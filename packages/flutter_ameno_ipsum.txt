# Setting Up flutter_ameno_ipsum

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To use the `flutter_ameno_ipsum` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_ameno_ipsum: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_ameno_ipsum/flutter_ameno_ipsum.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package

You can now use the package to generate placeholder text. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
String placeholderText = AmenoIpsum.generateParagraphs(2); // Generates 2 paragraphs of text
```

This will generate two paragraphs of Lorem Ipsum text that you can use in your widgets.

With these steps, you are now ready to use the `flutter_ameno_ipsum` package in your Flutter application!

<!-- START_MAIN -->
# Complete Example of flutter_ameno_ipsum

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_ameno_ipsum/flutter_ameno_ipsum.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Ameno Ipsum Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Ameno Ipsum Demo'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Column(
            children: [
              // Generate and display 2 paragraphs of placeholder text
              Text(
                AmenoIpsum.generateParagraphs(2),
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Generate and display a single sentence of placeholder text
              Text(
                AmenoIpsum.generateSentences(3),
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Ameno Ipsum Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold has a Padding widget to provide space around the content.
// 5. Inside the Padding, a Column widget is used to arrange the text widgets vertically.
// 6. The first Text widget displays 2 paragraphs of generated placeholder text using AmenoIpsum.generateParagraphs(2).
// 7. A SizedBox is added for spacing between the two text widgets.
// 8. The second Text widget displays 3 sentences of generated placeholder text using AmenoIpsum.generateSentences(3).
// 9. The app demonstrates the use of the flutter_ameno_ipsum package effectively by showcasing both paragraph and sentence generation.
