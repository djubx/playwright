import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:iconify_flutter_plus/iconify_flutter_plus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {

      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Iconify Flutter Plus Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying a home icon
              Iconify(
                'mdi:home', // Using Material Design Icons
                size: 64,   // Setting the size of the icon
                color: Colors.green, // Setting the color of the icon
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              // Displaying a settings icon
              Iconify(
                'mdi:settings', // Using Material Design Icons
                size: 64,   // Setting the size of the icon
                color: Colors.blue, // Setting the color of the icon
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              // Displaying a user icon
              Iconify(
                'mdi:account', // Using Material Design Icons
                size: 64,   // Setting the size of the icon
                color: Colors.red, // Setting the color of the icon
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that centers its child.
// Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the icons vertically.
// Each Iconify widget displays a different icon (home, settings, account) with specified sizes and colors.
// The SizedBox widget is used to add spacing between the icons for better visual separation.
// This simple app demonstrates how to use the iconify_flutter_plus package to display various icons in a Flutter application.
