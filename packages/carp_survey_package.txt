# Setup and Usage of carp_survey_package

## Installation
To get started with the `carp_survey_package`, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and include the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  carp_survey_package: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` if your survey requires internet access:
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following permissions if needed:
   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

## Basic Usage
To create a simple survey, you can use the `RealFlutter` class to initialize and display the survey. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to set up a survey:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:carp_survey_package/carp_survey_package.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: SurveyPage(),
    );
  }
}

class SurveyPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Survey')),
      body: SurveyForm(
        onSubmit: (responses) {
          // Handle the survey responses
          print('Survey Responses: $responses');
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple survey page that collects user responses and prints them to the console upon submission. The `SurveyForm` widget is provided by the `carp_survey_package` and handles the rendering of the survey questions.

With these steps, you can easily integrate the `carp_survey_package` into your Flutter application and start collecting valuable user feedback.

# Complete Example of carp_survey_package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:carp_survey_package/carp_survey_package.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: SurveyPage(),
    );
  }
}

class SurveyPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('User Feedback Survey')),
      body: SurveyForm(
        onSubmit: (responses) {
          // Handle the survey responses
          print('Survey Responses: $responses');
          // You can also navigate to a thank you page or show a dialog
          showDialog(
            context: context,
            builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
              title: Text('Thank You!'),
              content: Text('Your responses have been submitted.'),
              actions: [
                TextButton(
                  onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                  child: Text('OK'),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The SurveyPage widget is displayed as the home screen.
// 3. The SurveyForm widget is rendered, allowing users to fill out the survey.
// 4. Upon submission, the onSubmit callback is triggered, printing the responses to the console.
// 5. A dialog is shown to thank the user for their participation, enhancing user experience.
