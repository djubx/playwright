# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Text to Speech Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the `text_to_speech` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  text_to_speech: ^3.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for speech recognition.</string>
```

## Step 3: Import the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:text_to_speech/text_to_speech.dart';
```

## Step 4: Initialize and Use the Package
You can now create an instance of the `TextToSpeech` class and use it to convert text to speech. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
TextToSpeech tts = TextToSpeech();
```

You can set the language, pitch, and rate before speaking:

```dart
tts.setLanguage("en-US");
tts.setPitch(1.0);
tts.setSpeechRate(0.5);
tts.speak("Hello, welcome to the text to speech tutorial!");
```

This setup allows you to easily integrate text-to-speech functionality into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Text to Speech in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:text_to_speech/text_to_speech.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Text to Speech Example',
      home: SpeechHome(),
    );
  }
}

class SpeechHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SpeechHomeState createState() => _SpeechHomeState();
}

class _SpeechHomeState extends State<SpeechHome> {
  // Create an instance of the TextToSpeech class
  TextToSpeech tts = TextToSpeech();
  String textToSpeak = "Hello, this is a text to speech demo!";

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Text to Speech Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display the text that will be spoken
            Text(
              textToSpeak,
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Set language, pitch, and rate before speaking
                tts.setLanguage("en-US");
                tts.setPitch(1.0);
                tts.setSpeechRate(0.5);
                // Speak the text
                tts.speak(textToSpeak);
              },
              child: Text('Speak'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. The SpeechHome widget is created, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 4. Inside SpeechHome, we create an instance of TextToSpeech.
// 5. The UI consists of a Text widget displaying the text to be spoken and a button to trigger the speech.
// 6. When the button is pressed, the language, pitch, and speech rate are set, and the text is spoken using the speak method.
```

In this blog, we explored the `text_to_speech` Flutter package, detailing its features, setup process, and providing a complete example. The application flow is straightforward: it initializes the text-to-speech functionality, sets parameters, and speaks the text when the button is pressed. This package is a valuable addition to any Flutter application that requires voice interaction.
