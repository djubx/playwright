# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using uicons

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the uicons package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  uicons: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the uicons package:

```dart
import 'package:uicons/uicons.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using uicons in Your Application

You can now use the icons in your Flutter widgets. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use an icon:

```dart
Icon(Uicons.home, size: 30, color: Colors.blue);
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

#### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 5: Optimizations

To optimize the performance of your app when using icons, consider the following:
- Use `const` constructors for icons when possible to reduce widget rebuilds.
- Cache icons if they are used frequently to improve rendering performance.

With these steps, you are now ready to use the uicons package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of uicons in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:uicons/uicons.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'uicons Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('uicons Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Displaying a home icon
            Icon(Uicons.home, size: 50, color: Colors.blue),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Displaying a settings icon
            Icon(Uicons.settings, size: 50, color: Colors.green),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Displaying a user icon
            Icon(Uicons.user, size: 50, color: Colors.red),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp has a title and a theme, and it sets HomePage as the home widget.
// 4. HomePage is another StatelessWidget that builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the icons vertically.
// 6. Each icon is displayed with a specific size and color, showcasing the uicons package's capabilities.
```

// The application starts with the main function, which initializes the Flutter app. The RealFlutter class sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme. The HomePage class builds the main UI, displaying three different icons from the uicons package. Each icon is styled with size and color, demonstrating how easy it is to integrate and customize icons in a Flutter application. The app's flow is straightforward, making it easy to understand and extend.
