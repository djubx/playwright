# ip_country_lookup Flutter Package

The `ip_country_lookup` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that allows you to determine the country associated with a given IP address. This can be particularly useful in applications that require localization, user analytics, or content customization based on the user's geographical location.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the `ip_country_lookup` package in scenarios such as:
- **Localization**: Automatically adjusting the language or content of your app based on the user's country.
- **Analytics**: Gathering insights about your user base by analyzing the geographical distribution of your users.
- **Content Customization**: Serving different content or features based on the user's location.

## Features

- **Easy Integration**: Simple to add to your Flutter project with minimal setup.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Fast Lookups**: Provides quick responses for IP address lookups.
- **Offline Support**: Can cache results for previously looked-up IP addresses, reducing the need for repeated network calls.

With these features, the `ip_country_lookup` package is an excellent choice for developers looking to enhance their applications with geographical awareness.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using ip_country_lookup

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `ip_country_lookup` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `ip_country_lookup` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ip_country_lookup: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you plan to access the internet:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your Flutter application.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:ip_country_lookup/ip_country_lookup.dart';
```

2. Create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class (which we will define in the next section) and use the `lookup` method to get the country for a given IP address.

3. Handle the asynchronous nature of the lookup with `async` and `await`.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the package:

```dart
void main() async {
  // Initialize the package
  final ipLookup = RealFlutter();

  // Lookup the country for a specific IP address
  String country = await ipLookup.lookup('8.8.8.8');
  print('Country: $country');
}
```

This code initializes the `RealFlutter` class, performs a lookup for the IP address `8.8.8.8`, and prints the corresponding country.

# Complete Example of ip_country_lookup

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ip_country_lookup/ip_country_lookup.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// MyApp is the main widget of the application
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'IP Country Lookup',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: CountryLookupScreen(),
    );
  }
}

// CountryLookupScreen is the screen where the user can input an IP address
class CountryLookupScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CountryLookupScreenState createState() => _CountryLookupScreenState();
}

class _CountryLookupScreenState extends State<CountryLookupScreen> {
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController();
  String _country = '';

  // Function to perform the lookup
  Future<void> _lookupCountry() async {
    // Create an instance of the RealFlutter class
    final ipLookup = RealFlutter();
    
    // Get the IP address from the text field
    String ipAddress = _controller.text;

    // Perform the lookup and update the state
    String country = await ipLookup.lookup(ipAddress);
    setState(() {
      _country = country; // Update the country variable with the result
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('IP Country Lookup'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              controller: _controller,
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Enter IP Address',
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _lookupCountry, // Call the lookup function on button press
              child: Text('Lookup Country'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(
              'Country: $_country', // Display the result
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The application starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// The home screen is CountryLookupScreen, where users can input an IP address.
// A TextField allows users to enter an IP address, and an ElevatedButton triggers the lookup.
// When the button is pressed, the _lookupCountry function is called.
// This function creates an instance of RealFlutter, performs the lookup, and updates the UI with the result.
// The country associated with the entered IP address is displayed below the button.
