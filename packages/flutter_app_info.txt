# Flutter App Info Package

The `flutter_app_info` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that allows you to retrieve various information about the application, such as the app name, version, build number, and more. This package is particularly useful for applications that require displaying app information to users, such as in settings or about pages.

## When to Use This Package

You might want to use the `flutter_app_info` package in scenarios such as:
- Displaying app version and build information in the settings or about section of your app.
- Logging app information for analytics or debugging purposes.
- Providing users with information about the app for support or feedback.

## Features

- **Retrieve App Name**: Get the name of the application as defined in the `pubspec.yaml`.
- **Get Version and Build Number**: Access the version and build number of the app, which is essential for user support and updates.
- **Platform-Specific Information**: The package provides information that can vary between Android and iOS, allowing for tailored user experiences.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_app_info

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_app_info` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_app_info` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_app_info: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions if they are not already present:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` file to ensure that the app can access the necessary information. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and ensure it contains the following:

```xml
<key>CFBundleDisplayName</key>
<string>Your App Name</string>
<key>CFBundleShortVersionString</key>
<string>1.0</string>
<key>CFBundleVersion</key>
<string>1</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is an example of how to retrieve and display app information using the `flutter_app_info` package.

# Complete Example of Using flutter_app_info

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_app_info/flutter_app_info.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter App Info Example',
      home: AppInfoScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class AppInfoScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _AppInfoScreenState createState() => _AppInfoScreenState();
}

class _AppInfoScreenState extends State<AppInfoScreen> {
  String appName = '';
  String appVersion = '';
  String appBuildNumber = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Fetch app information when the widget is initialized
    _fetchAppInfo();
  }

  Future<void> _fetchAppInfo() async {
    // Retrieve app name, version, and build number
    String name = await FlutterAppInfo.getAppName();
    String version = await FlutterAppInfo.getVersion();
    String buildNumber = await FlutterAppInfo.getBuildNumber();

    // Update the state with the retrieved information
    setState(() {
      appName = name;
      appVersion = version;
      appBuildNumber = buildNumber;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('App Info'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('App Name: $appName'),
            Text('Version: $appVersion'),
            Text('Build Number: $appBuildNumber'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp with a title and home screen.
// 3. AppInfoScreen is a StatefulWidget that manages the state of the app information.
// 4. In the initState method, _fetchAppInfo is called to retrieve app information asynchronously.
// 5. _fetchAppInfo uses the FlutterAppInfo methods to get the app name, version, and build number.
// 6. The state is updated with the retrieved information, which triggers a rebuild of the widget.
// 7. The build method displays the app information in a centered column on the screen.
```
