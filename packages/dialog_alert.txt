# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Dialog Alert Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `dialog_alert` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dialog_alert: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the dialog, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:dialog_alert/dialog_alert.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Dialog Alert

### Basic Usage

You can create a simple alert dialog using the following code snippet:

```dart
DialogAlert.show(
  context: context,
  title: 'Alert Title',
  message: 'This is an alert message.',
  onConfirm: () {
    // Action to perform on confirm
  },
);
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions if you are using features that require them. However, for basic dialog alerts, no additional permissions are needed.

#### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your app's Info.plist file is configured correctly. Again, for basic usage of the dialog alert, no special configurations are required.

### Customizing the Dialog

You can customize the dialog further by adding more buttons or changing the styles. Hereâ€™s an example of a dialog with multiple buttons:

```dart
DialogAlert.show(
  context: context,
  title: 'Choose an Option',
  message: 'Please select one of the options below.',
  onConfirm: () {
    // Action for the first button
  },
  onCancel: () {
    // Action for the second button
  },
);
```

This flexibility allows you to tailor the dialog to fit your application's needs.

# Complete Example of Using Dialog Alert

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dialog_alert/dialog_alert.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dialog Alert Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Dialog Alert Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Triggering the dialog alert when the button is pressed
            DialogAlert.show(
              context: context,
              title: 'Confirmation',
              message: 'Do you want to proceed?',
              onConfirm: () {
                // Action to perform on confirmation
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Confirmed!')),
                );
              },
              onCancel: () {
                // Action to perform on cancellation
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Cancelled!')),
                );
              },
            );
          },
          child: Text('Show Alert'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget contains a button in the center of the screen.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the DialogAlert.show method is called.
// 5. The dialog displays a title and message, along with confirm and cancel actions.
// 6. If the user confirms, a SnackBar shows a confirmation message.
// 7. If the user cancels, a SnackBar shows a cancellation message.
```
