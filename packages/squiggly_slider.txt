# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Squiggly Slider

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the **squiggly_slider** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  squiggly_slider: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file if your slider interacts with device features. However, for basic usage, no additional configuration is required.

## Step 4: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:squiggly_slider/squiggly_slider.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Squiggly Slider
You can now use the `SquigglySlider` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
SquigglySlider(
  min: 0,
  max: 100,
  value: 50,
  onChanged: (value) {
    // Handle value change
  },
  activeColor: Colors.blue,
  inactiveColor: Colors.grey,
)
```

This code creates a squiggly slider that allows users to select a value between 0 and 100, with an initial value of 50.

# Complete Example of Squiggly Slider

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:squiggly_slider/squiggly_slider.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Squiggly Slider Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Squiggly Slider Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: SquigglySliderDemo(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SquigglySliderDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SquigglySliderDemoState createState() => _SquigglySliderDemoState();
}

class _SquigglySliderDemoState extends State<SquigglySliderDemo> {
  double _sliderValue = 50; // Initial value for the slider

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Text(
          'Selected Value: ${_sliderValue.toStringAsFixed(1)}',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20), // Adds space between text and slider
        SquigglySlider(
          min: 0, // Minimum value of the slider
          max: 100, // Maximum value of the slider
          value: _sliderValue, // Current value of the slider
          onChanged: (value) {
            setState(() {
              _sliderValue = value; // Update the slider value
            });
          },
          activeColor: Colors.blue, // Color of the active part of the slider
          inactiveColor: Colors.grey, // Color of the inactive part of the slider
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds the SquigglySliderDemo.
// 4. SquigglySliderDemo is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the slider value.
// 5. The slider value is initialized to 50 and displayed above the slider.
// 6. When the user interacts with the SquigglySlider, the onChanged callback updates the state with the new value.
// 7. The UI rebuilds to reflect the updated slider value.
```
